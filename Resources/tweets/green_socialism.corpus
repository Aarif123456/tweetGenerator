<|startoftext|>#KierStarmer put it to #BlusteringBoris that he had one last chance to give him a straight answer rather than ‘yet another pre-prepared rant’. BB’s response - another pre-prepared rant - he cannot help himself, blustering is in his DNA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BlusteringBoris has been caught out and he has no answer. He has always claimed to have followed scientific advice on the epidemic 100%. SAGE strongly advised a ‘Circuit break’ 3 weeks ago, BB has given us a confused mess of tiers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump’s Florida rally showed thousands milling around with no masks. Stand-by for news next week of a Florida super-spreader event. Trump says he tested negative – but what’s the current rate of false negatives – is it one in three?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So now we have three tiers. The lowest is Medium and the middle is High. So that’s clear. But the middle may have extras, so that makes 4 tiers, and will the extra middle ones be Low-Medium &amp; High-Medium or Middle-High &amp; High Medium. We need to be told.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The truth is out! #BlusteringBoris is no longer following scientific advice. Three weeks ago SAGE wanted a two-week circuit-break, and we got a 10pm curfew instead. ‘Considering the economy’ means balancing profit against #Covid deaths<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where is the evidence to support the #10pm curfew? There is none. Just another daft idea plucked from nowhere. The virus cannot tell the time. People are kicked out of regulated environments into unregulated streets and off-licenses. Stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BlusteringBoris to announce new #Tier system, but immediately speaks of local variations within tiers; the logic of that says he hasn’t enough tiers. 3-Tier system is too coarse. Every possibility must be included, otherwise confusion will be even greater.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do we not hear about #’R’ values any more? Are the rises too great for #BlusteringBoris to be able to gloss over?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best news yet out of US as #Biden’s lead over #Trump increases. The man is a disaster, and the sooner he goes the better. Someone should calculate: how many excess #Covid deaths are directly due to #Trump’s perverse incompetence?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If one individual can be identified as the world’s worst #Superspreader of #Covid, it must be #Trump. He is also the world’s worst #Superspreader of #Covid lies and misinformation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#LucyFrazer, #PrisonsMinister, has been taking waffle lessons from her boss. Pressed with simple questions on TV, she answered not one. #BlusteringBoris should take note – if he can’t make the despatch box, she would make an admirable stand-in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BlusterinBoris’s #ToadyingTories are all learning his techniques at PM questions. Read the question with inappropriate emphases and punch the air as you speak. Laughable to watch him – ludicrous to watch them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #10pmCurfew has been counterproductive in exactly the ways predicted. 9.30 swills, all round to the off-license, and mass private gatherings. Now it seems there is no scientific justification for it. #BlusteringBoris must retract before the commons vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet another PM questions with none of the difficult ones answered by #BlusteringBoris. He welcomes all those from his #ToadyingTories, but blusters his way out of real questions. Doesn’t everyone see though him yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump said, “Maybe I’m Immune”. Never a truer word. He is immune to normal social exchange, immune to his effect on others, immune to any consequence of any of his actions. His niece, Mary, in her blistering book, calls him a sociopath.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Infectious #Trump has now also infected an entire helicopter crew. Masks only give PARTIAL protection, and its all for #TV audiences. He was clearly out of breath and is clearly not recovered as he is claiming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>…Does #BlusteringBoris not understand that it is not the source of our power that matters, it is how much we use. Instead of promising monstrous #NorthSea #Windfarms, he needs to plan ways for drastic reductions in overall consumption – by everyone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BlusteringBoris wants all households and their cars to be powered by offshore #Windfarms by 2030. Has he never heard of high-pressure anticyclones? Does he not realise that the entire North Sea can easily be totally becalmed? …<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BlusteringBoris criticises old ways and says post-#Covid, all must change for the better. Has he forgotten we have just endured more than decade of his tory party in charge of things? Does he take no responsibility for the mess we all have to suffer?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#UK #Test&amp;Trace once more shown to be woefully inadequate. Does #BlusteringBoris not know how to apologise – is everything an opportunity to wave his arms around and claim that he knows best – just like his idol #Trump often does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does #Trump believe that facemasks offer 100% protection? Very sadly mistaken if he does. His niece Mary calls him a narcissistic sociopath who cares for no-one but himself. His car drive to greet his fans is surely proof of this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it not a criminal offence deliberately to infect others with potentially deadly diseases? Shouldn’t #Trump be prosecuted for forcing his security men to become infected with his virus? Why didn’t they refuse, other than because they fear his tantrums?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BlusteringBoris still offering ludicrous elbow bumps as greetings. Others should refuse him. Unless forearms are more than 1 metre long there’s no distancing. Almost as bad as infected #Trump forcing his security men into a car with him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not enough for the #PostOffice simply to say they will not oppose appeals from convicted employees. Enormous compensation must be universal, and the most senior heads must be called to account, starting with ex-CEO #PaulaVennells<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Trump will now probably attempt to delay or cancel the US elections. Impossible. Over 2 million have already voted. If they have more debates by #Zoom, at least the moderator will be able to mute #Trump’s interruptions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No-one would wish harm on the #Trumps, but the way he mocked #Biden in the first #Debate for mask-wearing seems like nemesis. To be hoped that this bad experience will finally convince the fool to take #Covid seriously<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#EU has given notice of intention to prosecute over law-breaking #UKGovt. Is anyone surprised? They have also said: no resolution- no deal. Is this proof that #BlusteringBoris intended this outcome all along.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Mild #SirLindseyHoyle has gone on what for him is the rampage. #BlusteringBoris is told he is treating parliament with ‘total disregard’. The similarities with #Trump go beyond their crazy hairstyles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MaryTrump, #Donald’s niece, has written about whom she calls the ‘World’s most dangerous man’. Read her book, and understand what made Donald the sociopath he so obviously is. He behaves now as she describes his behaviour of 60 years ago<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Trump #Biden ‘debate’ produced no surprises. The #US has one third of a billion people – do these two really represent the best that country can manage to offer its people? It was an unmitigated shambles, and there will be two more like it to come<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BlusteringBoris laments the national run-down of #Apprenticeship schemes over recent years. Maybe someone should remind him that we’ve been lumbered with his tory governments for all that time. He was a part of #Osborne’s #Austerity programme.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Education minister #GillianKeegan has no idea about new rules for Newcastle, and #BlusteringBoris himself apologises for ‘mis-speaking’, ie, he doesn’t know either. What chance have the rest of us got to know what’s going on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unilateral, short-notice policy changes from central government means that local authorities have no idea what’s going on and have no preparations in place to enforce new rules. #LAs are rightly demanding much greater involvement in decision making<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not much news on #CovidTesting recently. Still in trouble despite continuing claims. The new #app can’t recognise blocks of vital information. Urgent need to cancel all privatised contracts and let the #NHS professionals do the job<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The consequences of the 10pm #Curfew are exactly as predicted. A big swill at 9.30, followed by private parties, street gatherings and mass visits to off-licenses. Either rescind this nonsense, or close the pubs etc altogether<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump says that revelations about his tax-dodging are all ‘Fake Noos’. He claims to have paid millions into US treasury. The truth is that his best efforts amount to $15 a week. The man is a serial crook and a serial liar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now just 3 months to go to a #NoDeal crashout. #Boris #Blusters and #Gove blames everyone except those who got us into this mess, ie him and his incompetent colleagues. They have to get any deal past the 27 member parliaments. What’s their chances?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has the #BritishRetailConsortium just woken up to the reality of a #NoDeal #Brexit? They are telling us things we were warning of years ago. Still, better late than never. Average new #Tariff on #EU imported foodstuffs will be 20%. Total annual UK bill about £3billion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BlusteringBoris is presuming to tell world leaders how to meet climate demands. He needs to get his own UK climate house in order, and on target, before he does that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Figures show that #Test&amp;Trace is failing because test return times are actually getting significantly worse. We need a proper medical scientist in charge, and we need all the contracts to be back with the NHS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Sunak still has no proposals for meeting the final bill for #Covid. Needs to scrap #HS2 and scrap the replacement for #Trident. That would just about do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Sunak’s answer for the end of #Furlough is now revealed to be what a lot of others have been asking for. Still very complex &amp; difficult to understand. We can look towards significant redundancies at the end of October.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MichaelGove has woken up. We have been warning for 4 years of chaos at Dover and other ports if we have a #NoDeal #Brexit.  7000 lorries in 2-day queues will be commonplace. You got us into this mess, Michael, so you get us out of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Redundancy processes can take up to 90 days. #Furlough ends in half that. What are companies to do? #Sunak &amp; #BlusteringBoris have always known of the strong possibility of a second #Covid wave. Why are there no plans whatever to replace furlough?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On two successive days, #Blustering Boris has first said that #Test&amp;Trace is essential to control #Covid, and then that it has little to offer. Does he know what he is saying, or are his speech-writers playing silly games with him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the promise of more information is honoured it will be welcome. #DailyBriefings should resume, and ministers and their advisers should be subjected to continuing scrutiny. People will respect provable need, but they must have the facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The 10pm #Curfew is a nonsense. It will produce a 10pm swill. If you could have caught the virus from a crowded pub at 10.30, you can catch it at 9.30 in the same pub, during the final rush for drinks. A complete shutdown is still very likely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the 1970s &amp; 80s, millions were sacked as the mines, shipyard and steel mills were closed for political expedience. Workers told to get on their bikes. Now professional sportspeople are whingeing – at least some of them have bikes to get on to!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We said #BlusteringBoris was wrong to urge people to return to work, and now he has done yet another #UTurn in a summer of #UTurns. Not objecting, just observing, and asking the man to listen to others and to think before he #Blusters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here’s a couple of good ideas for #ChancellorSunak to recoup the massive expenditures provoked by #Covid. Cancel #HS2, and cancel the replacement for #Trident. That will give you hundreds of billions to play with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ChancellorSunak is facing severe criticism from his shadow. He has a massive gap to fill in our finances caused by #Covid and by inappropriate purchases. #BlusteringBoris has specifically ruled out a return to ‘Austerity’. So where will the money come from?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally, #RailFranchising is to end. A new system will soon come into force. If #GrantShapps is wondering what to call the new rail service, he has an obvious option. #BritishRail !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The country’s scientific advisers are clearly offering veiled warnings about the second #CovidPeak. We can’t ignore them. If a second #Lockdown is going to prove inevitable, then by far the best thing is to do it sooner rather than later.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At last, #BlusteringBoris can rightly claim the UK as the world leader. No doubt about it, we beat the rest, hands down. Trouble is, it’s in the area of laundering dirty money. All the dodgy crooks of the world now use UK businesses to cheat their own peoples.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Schools, colleges and universities must be the last to close in the case of a nationwide #lockdown. Pupils and students have suffered far too much disruption already. It is difficult, but there’s no other way to defeat the virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump is determined to replace #RuthGinsberg as soon as possible. His two front runners are both far right. But they are also both very young, and the appointment is for life. #USA can look forward to a generational rightwards shift in their supreme court. Very worrying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BlusteringBoris bamboozled the British people for the last election, and fooled enough voters. Now his #NIBorder fudges are being exposed. What is happening is what we said all along would happen. He can’t hide behind lies any longer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today’s #R value could be nationally as high as 1.4. This is serious. It means that for every ten infected people, in a few days there will be 14 more. We are heading for a new lockdown, and for greatest effect, the sooner the better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scottish &amp; Welsh governments are asking for joint discussions. About time. It is crazy for the 4 UK nations to operate different rules, or similar variations of rules. That can only increase confusion, and confused rules will always be broken.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What are the latest regulations about #Covid? Who can we meet; who can we not meet? Obvious conclusion from street interviews is that most people do not have a clue. Schools must continue, but the rest of us need a return to full #lock-down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since the daily numbers of completed #CovidTests is actually falling, that cannot any longer be blamed for the rapidly rising numbers of positive findings. No recent reports of #R numbers – is that because they are now routinely above 1? Sorry #ReesMogg - more carping!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some airlines are #CovidTesting before flights. Do they assume all #CovidTesting is 100% reliable? Are they ignoring #FalseNegatives? Most people will show #Negative during first 2-3 days of infection. How many ‘safe’ flights will carry missed #CovidPositives?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#EU is dithering over continuing #RefugeeCrisis, and is wasting time over impending #ClimateCrisis. If temperatures rise more than 2 degrees, the consequences will include #Refugee waves that will dwarf the current numbers. No more talking – just action from now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With all the contradictions and uncertainties, there is only one thing clear about the latest Govt Bill. #BlusteringBoris hasn’t a clue about the mess he has unleashed, only his supercharged arrogance and hubris is keeping him going.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One Govt minister says one thing, another says another. Govt lawyers are resigning. US says trade deals are in jeopardy. Ursula von der Leyen even quotes Margaret Thatcher on the honouring of trade deals. What is going on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No surprise that #BlusteringBoris got his deceitful bill through its first hearing. With that majority, what an upset if he did not. But with so many senior tories ganging up against him, how will he finally push it through?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The ending of #Furlough is coinciding with record #YouthUnemployment. Now a desperate need to continue state support in some form, and that doesn’t include daft ideas like subsidising pub meals for those who were planning to go out anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Despite the continuing worst forest fires ever in USA history, #Trump still remains in obstinate denial. Still maintaining that poor forest management is to blame. Perhaps he thinks that building a wall against the fires could be the answer?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Set aside all the #BorisBluster over the new #InternalMarketBill and be perfectly clear about one thing. #NoDeal = #Tariffs at the #NIBorder. No two ways about that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tory minister #KitMalthouse declares it’s OK to break the specific letter of #InternationalLaw so long as we abide by the spirit of that law. Will that now apply to all #InternationalTreaties negotiated by the tories? Caveat Emptor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #InternalMarketBill debated today. Five former PMs, former tory leaders and a former #AttorneyGeneral all think #BlusteringBoris is behaving improperly. Lots of senior tories very upset, yet #Boris #Blusters on. What a #Bozo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The numbers are rapidly rising, and still #Hancock has not sorted out the testing fiasco. He should not have privatised it. Instead he should have made more resources available to the #NHS and let the professionals get on with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So we now have the #RuleofSix. What does that mean? It depends where you live. How much longer do we tolerate the daftness of 4 different sets of rules for the 4 #UKCountries? What is stopping them agreeing a common set of rules other than arrogance?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is #BlusteringBoris and his crew doing about the outrage of #Lesbos? A few desultory offers from a few #EU nations, but silence from us. These are desperate families being treated appallingly, and #Johnson is keeping his head down. Shame on him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to economics pundits lamenting the state of the #UKEconomy, it is quite clear that not one of them has any clear idea of the demands that will soon be placed on traditional economic activities by the impending climate crisis. Rude awakening soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As #R increases above 1, and therefore, #Covid infection rates begin to rise exponentially, a culture of blame is spreading. Most unhelpful. It’s not anyone’s fault. This is a global crisis, and we all must do our bit, and stop blaming others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The 4 #UKNations all have different #Covid regulations and advice packages. This is simply daft. They must, without delay, get together to agree one policy. Hyperinflated egos may suffer, but the people need simple clarity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Infection rates are rapidly rising. #Hospital admission figures now rapidly rising. The number of patients on ventilators also rising. It is inevitable that #Death rates will see similar rises, and this is to be expected. So stop the call for #ReturnTo Work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #R value now officially above 1. The #SecondWave is inevitable. So why is the Government insisting on a universal return to work, and a running down of the furlough scheme? Surely now help needs increasing, not decreasing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #WWF has reported that the rate of loss of species due to human activity is at an historically record rate. Most to blame are trashing of rainforests to grow monocultures. We need to cut down meat and cut out burning oil right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Local charities are concerned about cancellation of #GreatNorthRun. Surely no problem. If the cash is there and if the cash is spare, just hand it over. Why does someone need to run virtual miles to clinch the deal?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#EU formally warns that current #tradetalks between #Barnier and #Frost are in serious jeopardy if #UK pushes ahead with #InternalMarketBill. No surprise. #BlusteringBoris intended to leave with no deal all along.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Raab envisages testing an entire theatre audience before admitting them. Has the man finally lost it? Who, possibly, would set out for a night at the theatre to face a 90-minute wait for test results, &amp; then maybe to be sent home?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BlusteringBoris promises 3 million #CovidTests per day in three months. His usual tactic. When things are going wrong today, promise big things for tomorrow; even give it a daft name like #Moonshot. This yet another #Blustering distraction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Blustering Boris agrees that #EU has control over NI trade rules. Also claims that UK law will govern trade with NI. How soon before either NI merges with the Republic or #Blustering Boris needs to build a hard border across Ireland? One or the other!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was this inept government that encouraged asymptomatic people to seek #CovidTests. Now their privatised labs can’t handle the demand. That’s why genuine cases are being sent hundreds of miles for tests – if they can get one at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#James’Massive’Cleverley has clearly learned from his boss. Listen to the question; ignore it; bluster on about something entirely different; blame the opposition for lack of support; tell us what a #“massive” effort is being made.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BlusteringBoris’ latest performance over who is to blame for #CovidTest breakdown. Is it low lab capacity or too many requests? Never mind, he has now promised half-a-million tests a day in six weeks from now. Is anybody taking bets?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#KierStarmer has been asking #BlusteringBoris questions at PMQ since April. So far #BB has not answered a single one. Listen to him. He waves his arms around and #Blusters about anything but the topic of the question. The man is a clown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Evidence of #Brexiteers trying to blame “lies on both sides” of the #Brexit debate for the present mess. Rubbish. What is now happening was clearly predicted years ago. Is it our fault they ignored us? You caused this, you get us out of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The condition of #‘LongCovid’ is now recognised. Does this call into question the recent switch in counting #Covid deaths to only those with a positive test in the previous 28 days. Surely we need now to return to the old criterion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TeresaMay, who now looks good in comparison, is concerned that new #NIBill illegal provisions will lead no-one to trust us in the future. She is right. At least Govt chief lawyer has the self-respect and integrity to resign. Any chance #Johnson &amp; #Lewis might follow suit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NIProtocol now appears to be inoperable. What a surprise. Just like we were all saying years ago when #BlusteringBoris tried to convince us he had finally settled #Brexit. The whole sad mess is now unravelling, and #Johnson still #Blusters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NISecretary #BrandonLewis admits his new #NIBill will break #InternationalLaw. But only a little bit. So that’s alright then. Can we now all go out and break the law - so long as it’s only a little bit? What a clown – and he’s a government SofS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3000 new #Covid cases in one day signals the start of the expected #SecondWave. What a daft time for #Blustering Boris to order all civil servants to go back to their desks – even those who can perfectly well work from home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Compromises and fudges over the #NIBorder will probably result in #BlusteringBoris doing more for Irish unity than any other #Tory&amp;Unionist prime minister over the last century.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GeorgeEustice is trying to say that a #NoDeal outcome was part of the #tories’ last election promises. This is absolutely untrue. #NoDeal will come because of years of lies and incompetence and will cause us chaos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BlusteringBoris talks of dotting ‘i’s and crossing ‘t’s in the #EU deal. But there aren’t any ‘i’s or ‘t’s to dot or cross. The whole thing is exactly the mess that was predicted years ago, and now they are trying to fudge their way through it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DominicRaab is blaming #EU for #Brexit impasse. Wants to be treated like any new applicant. But why should they? We are the ones causing all the problems. We are the ones who have rejected them. Get real #Raab<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New #Podcast worth attention. ‘So Hot Right Now’. People generally switch off when the #HeatingClimate is mentioned. Two journalists are attempting new ways of provoking interest. A much-needed initiative - greatly welcomed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Blustering Boris wants all civil servants back at their desks for corrupt reasons. This is not about work efficiency, it is about provoking the private sector, and answering demands from city sandwich shops. #Uturn urgently needed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Highly offensive of #BlusteringBoris to demand return of all civil servants in terms of efficiency of work. Most of them are far more competent than he. Most find they can perfectly well work from home, and why not?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The next few weeks will see an increase in #R. It could already be as high as 1.4. So what does #BarmyBoris do? He starts bullying civil servants to return to their offices en masse. Time for your 13th #U-turn of the year, Boris.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Schools, universities and colleges are all returning to full operation. Everyone agrees that that is a good thing. Disadvantaged children are much too far behind as it is. But this will inevitably increase the #R number, and we must take steps to offset this<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If £100 billion is really available for rail improvements, where is it best spent? On rebuilding and electrifying the appallingly inadequate Northern network, or knocking 20 minutes off fat cats’ journeys from Leeds to London. No contest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A plane flying from a Greek island could land at Cardiff, Manchester or Birmingham, and half the passengers could carry on as usual in England, while the other half would face 2 weeks #Lockdown in Wales. This is sheer governmental bungling incompetence.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Now that #DidoHarding has been shifted to run the board overseeing #Healthcare in this country, who is in charge of #CovidTesting. Is she doing both jobs on a part-time basis? That sounds like good news for us all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pity about the #BBC wimps who have given in to the #Jingoists. Take a close look at the words of those two wretched songs – surely they are wholly out of place in the 21st century<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Much government dithering over Manchester. Are they in #Lockdown or not? Far better to leave such important decisions to local authorities who know what they are doing, as opposed to incompetent ministers.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Decision to delay #Lockdown so that #CheltenhamGoldCup could go ahead now seen as disastrous. Who was involved in decision? Board member #DidoHarding, who went on to cause chaos at #Test&amp;Trace, and who now runs #NIHP. Good choice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having presided over Europe’s worst #TestandTrace scheme – run mainly by NHS and army personnel - #DidoHarding now jumps ship to wreck the NHS. Perhaps she will ensure more billions going to US companies for doing nothing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One-time jockey, #DidoHarding, enobled by Uni-pal #Cameron, has absolutely no experience in #HealthCare. Can the NHS look forward to a future as rosy as #ThomasCook’s or #Woolworth’s?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DidoHarding was director of #ThomasCook and of #Woolworths. #DailyMail described her performance at #Talktalk as the ‘Worst customer service in the UK’. Just the choice for overseeing quality of service in the NHS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DidoHarding now chairs the new #NationalInstituteforHealthProtection. Good choice. She presided over our disastrous #Test&amp;Trace scheme which has paid over half a £billion to private firms #Serco and #Sitel for doing almost nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Concerning news about universal drop in take-up of #FluVaccine across the UK. #Vaccination is the only hope to contain #Covid. The combined effects of both viruses out of control over winter could be catastrophic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #BlackLivesMatter movement is the most important issue of today. #WhiteAmericans still don’t understand the depth and strength of feeling. They still don’t understand the changes they need to make to fundamental thought.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is more frightening, the sight of US cops toting pistols, or a juvenile Wisconsin vigilante with an automatic weapon in his hands? The #WildWest is still live and kicking. The #US needs to repeal its #2ndAmendment without delay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So #EdDavey is the new #LibDem leader. Is this the same #EdDavey who was #SecretaryofState for #ClimateChange in the #CameronCoalition? The one which broke all those #LibDem manifesto promises? Looks good for the future!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Before #LevelUp #Johnson came to power, the wealth gap between children was narrowing. Then it began widening – even before the effect of #Covid. The man is all #Bluster and #Uturns. The sooner we can get rid of him the better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Comments and opinions from white Americans simply show they have no idea of the depth of the frustration felt by their fellow citizens. More #PoliceShootings demonstrate either mass stupidity or total lack of concern.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet another #UTurn from #BlusteringBoris. Why does he not listen and think before opening his mouth? Can we expect more #UTurns on #Brexit? The days &amp; weeks are passing and still no sign of a #BrexitDeal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The BBC say the #LastNightoftheProms will play #RuleBritannia without the words. #BlusteringBoris is livid. Long overdue that this outrageous hangover from #ImperialDays should bite the dust. Long may it remain buried.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TrumpJunior apparently wants to end #“PeacefulProtest”. How does he propose to do that within the US democratic process. Perhaps he would give the police #WaterCannon or possibly automatic weapons?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump seems to fear the outcome of a #PostalBallot. What’s his problem, doesn’t he trust his own administration’s processes. Where does he think the frauds will occur, and who does he suspect of being fraudsters?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too much reliance is being placed on facemasks. They help to stop the wearer spreading #Covid, but they are only partially effective at protecting the wearer from others. Much better guidance is needed before schools all resume.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #RepublicanConvention gets underway and loyal #Trump supporters say they fear #Biden because he will “Bring #Socialism to the USA”. If only!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Face masks have never been reliable or infallible. Schools need clear government plans now for how they will need to deal with inevitable individual #Covid outbreaks. This needs much better planning than they managed for the #ExamFiasco<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#R is hovering around 1. It cannot be allowed to rise above 1, because that will create new peaks. Contingency plans need to be in place now to protect the #Reopening of schools and colleges.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Schools and colleges need temporary accommodations and they need more teachers and teaching assistants. #BlusteringBoris wants to #LevelUp society, he can start the process by bringing all class sizes down to Etonian levels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We had #Nightingale hospitals to support the NHS; we now need similar initiatives to support the return to schools and colleges. It is unreasonable to expect students to wear masks – practical solutions are sadly missing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Schools are about to resume, but silence from #BlusteringBoris about details of procedures, and how to react to any outbreaks. Hope he enjoyed his camping holiday, that was obviously much more important to him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All #Students need to return to their schools and colleges on schedule. If this means compromises to keep #R below 1.0, then those compromises are necessary. Children’s education is more important than brewery profits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The growing reliance on self-administered #HomeTests for #Covid19 will certainly increase the number of false negatives because the sample is unlikely to have been properly taken. The entire testing process needs urgent review.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Covid tests taken up to three days after infection still have two-in-three chances of showing negative. At their best, test results still need to carry warnings about reliability.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is worrying news about the interpretation of #Covid #TestResults. The reliability of a ‘Negative’ needs to be questioned. A test taken within 24 hours of actual viral infection will almost always show negative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Record breaking temperatures just recorded in the #Arctic. The #SvalbardGlobalSeedVault which stores the world’s final plant backup may be at risk. Stop burning #FossilFuels NOW.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WildFires still rage in California and it’s clear that record breaking heatwaves and droughts are to blame. What more does it need to convince #Trump that #GlobalHeating, caused by human activity, is a reality?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>US #OpinionPolls show that over one third of Americans would refuse a #CovidVaccine. In the UK the number is half this, but still of great concern. #AntiVax nonsense must be countered urgently if we are ever to control the #Pandemic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CovidComplacency is creeping in. Many saying the virus has been defeated, but simply not true. It has been controlled, contained, suppressed. Any slackening of vigilance when schools return will see inevitable #SecondWave<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#UKDebt now declared at 2trillion, equal to GDP. Said to be worst ratio since 1960s. But what about #Attlee govt’s ratio of over 250% war-debt/GDP? Even with that they created the nationalised industries and the #NHS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NoDealBrexit now looks inevitable, despite tory promises. What will happen at #Nissan? What will happen to our #FishingFleet? What will happen at the #NIBorder? No-one has a clue – and especially #BlusteringBoris doesn’t have a clue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MichelBarnier accuses #DavidFrost, UK negotiator, of ‘time wasting’. There’s not a great deal left to waste. We were originally told that the other 27 EU nations would need 3 months to ratify any deal – that leaves us 6 weeks at most to complete talks. Not a hope<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why further delays over #BTECs. What are they dithering about? Same rules and same principles must apply to everyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was #Ofqual who devised the privilege-favouring algorithm, but #Williamson and his ministers must have known and approved. Clearly no decency or honesty left in #BlusteringBoris’ government<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are plenty of apologies from ministers and others, but why no resignations yet? Was the #ExamResults fiasco no-one’s fault; is no-one taking responsibility?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ExtinctionRebellion is announcing plans for resuming activity, post-lockdown. AGS fully supports their aims and activities. #BlusteringBoris is still playing at tackling the climate crisis. The lockdown reductions in CO2 need to be repeated, additionally, every year till 2050.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Care-home owners are complaining about massive insurance rises – some nearly 900%. Easy solution would be to take all such homes under the aegis of the #NHS, but where would be the profit for shareholders in that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fans are applauding the running of the 2020 #TourDeFrance. #TeamIneos is being widely promoted, but Ineos is run by billionaire #JimRadcliffe who made his fortune making plastics for single use, and which are now clogging our oceans. Which matters most?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet another former US Republican high-flyer, #ColinPowell has endorsed the #Democrat ticket. How many more defections before the message begins to sink in that #Trump most go?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This summer has been one of the warmest, wettest and windiest on record. Why? Because of #GlobalHeating, that’s why, and it will only get worse unless we stop producing CO2. The only way to do that is to #StopBurningFossilFuels NOW.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do we no longer receive reports of #R-numbers? This information is vital for local actions to be most effective in curtailing the spread of #Covid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After 5 months, #CovidTesting is to be significantly increased. So why was it halted months ago when it was most needed. #PHE is to go, so no-one can answer that. #TestResults must now be given to local authorities who are best placed to take effective action.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More redundancies and job losses on a daily basis (yesterday #Easyjet, today #M&amp;S) as furlough winds down and harsh reality kicks in. Free-market capitalism clearly far too fragile to cope with big disasters. Ten years ago we nationalised the banks to keep them going.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PHE had an important role in preventive medicine – taking responsibility for the overall well-being of the nation. Who will do that in future? #?NIHP – it is not mentioned in their remit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #PHE no longer exists, what value in an enquiry into its activities. #BlusteringBoris intends to dodge any careful look into his own failures with the #CovidCrisis, especially the ludicrous early suspension of #testandtrace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Johnson to abolish #PHE (#PublicHealthEngland) and replace it with #NationalInstituteforHealthProtection. All smoke and mirrors. Same people, same resources, same remit, just more central government control. What can go wrong?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BlusteringBoris has recently admitted the need for an enquiry into his handling of the #CovidCrisis and of the input of #PublicHealthEngland. What better way to undermine such an enquiry than to abolish #PublicHealthEngland. Nice one, Johnson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Williamson says he is “Incredibly sorry” about the exam chaos. He is right. His apology totally lacks any credibility. He has known since March, when the exams were cancelled. He saw the Scottish experience a week ago. He now blames #Ofqual. He simply must go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BlusteringBoris has finally seen sense. What an embarrassment. Any decent-minded politician would resign right now. Is anyone keeping a running total of #toryUTurns<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This has been a unique and difficult year for everyone. #Teachers’Assessments may not be precise and some errors may result – but far better to err on the side of this year’s students, rather than making many of them victims<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Northern Ireland will now rely on teachers’ assessments for #GCSEResults. A welcome outbreak of common sense and decency. #BlusteringBoris still has time to prevent chaos later this week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even #BlusteringBoris’s own tories are turning against him. He must end this exam stupidity, have the decency to admit it has gone wrong, and declare faith in professional #Teachers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NHS commentator #MD in #PrivateEye says, “The best protection against Covid is wealth”. The #CovidDeathRate is twice as high in poor areas than in rich ones. So much for #Blustering Boris saying we are all in this together. So much for the tories being the #PartyoftheWorkingClass<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The way to handle any future #Covid outbreak is to put #LocalAuthorities at the forefront. End the ridiculous outsourcing of testing, entrust the #NHS and make sure #TestData are immediately available to #LocalAuthorities for effective rapid responses<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They’ve all had months to get the exams right and have failed miserably. We leave the #EU in about the same time-scale with no sign of a #deal anywhere. The #CrashOut will most affect the North - #Nissan will up and go if there is no deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Ofqual has joined the gang of bodgers. They can’t decide how #appeals over #exam results need to be made. How can any student, after six months of inactivity, possibly contemplate sitting a #retake. Incompetence and ineptitude rule all that #BlunderingBoris attempts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AntiVax proponents MUST be defeated by clear argument. The #Science is clear and unequivocal. #Covid19 will be defeated, but ONLY by universal #EffectiveVaccines. #GlobalImmunity will fail if #AntiVax nonsense – from any and every source – is allowed to spread<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First call on #EffectiveVaccines worldwide must be for #HealthCareWorkers followed by other #CareWorkers and #EssentialWorkers. Next call must be for all with special susceptibility to the #Virus, and then finally, everyone else. Oppose #VaccineNationalism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The world has over 7 billion people. To defeat #Covid, we will need at least 15 billion doses of #EffectiveVaccines. This will take years to achieve. Vaccines MUST be distributed where they will be most effective in the simple interests of ALL humanity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rich nations hoarded vaccines for the #2009FluPandemic and the term #VaccineNationalism was coined. This must not happen with #Covid; any #EffectiveVaccines MUST be distributed according to need, not according to national wealth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The way humanity will defeat #Covid is by co-ordinated global action. Isolated national initiatives will not work. #BlusteringBoris has bought nearly 400 million unproven vaccine doses, #Trump has established #OperationWarpSpeed explicitly to act in US national interests. WRONG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#California wildfires again out of control. When will #Trump wake up to the obvious cause? If nothing is done it will get worse. #StopBurningFossilFuels NOW.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who should we trust? Professional teachers who know their students, or politically motivated IT geeks who compose algorithms designed to favour #publicschools. #2020Exams. #Alevelchaos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BoristheBlusterer still insisting #2020Exams are fair. Now clear that the bigger the class size, the more likely the downgrading. Now, who would that favour?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2 centuries since #TomPaine defined our #Rights to include the Right to choose our governors. #BoristheBlusterer has just sent loads more failed politicians and #torydonors to the #HouseofLords to make our laws. Either scrap it or make it fully elected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Downgrading #A-level results universally may be reasonable, but #Williamson is doing it by postcode. Clearly unfair and class-based. #Blustering Boris’s old school results won’t be downgraded for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even #Met-office forecasters are blaming #global-heating for current heat wave. Only possible way forward to prevent even worse effects is to stop producing #CO2. That means, stop burning #fossil-fuels NOW. Not next year, or by 2050 – stop it NOW.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Williamson &amp; #Blustering Boris have had 4 months to plan for exam gradings and they’ve bodged it. They now have 4 months to avoid a #No-deal #Brexit. What are the chances?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quite good to hear from US (2 cheers only) of #Biden’s vice-presidential partner, #Kamala-Harris. Better if she had been No1, but maybe in 4 years after US’s oldest ever candidate #Biden has retired.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Sec-of-State-Williamson has difficult choice after exam results; Scottish style U-turn, or panic policy change. He has gone for the policy panic and is allowing #mock_results, but what of those students who don’t have graded mocks. Total shambles after months of knowing about it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#UK officially in worst ever recession. Worse than most of Europe. #Rishi_Sunak says it’s because we have much bigger entertainment sector. Not surprising since decades of #tory-rule have destroyed everything else. What will happen after now inevitable #No-Deal-Brexit crashout?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To meet climate demands, #AGS wants all fossil fuel burning to cease NOW. If we don't burn it. we won't need to ship it, and disasters like the #Mauritius spill would never need to happen.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The suitcase wasn’t battered in those days and he was proud of it because he wrote his name and the date inside the lid – or at least he attempted to … what he actually wrote before he ran out of space was ‘W.

<|startoftext|>@MarkJDoran @xr_kensington Take your point but our comment refers to a Green Socialist editorial comparing global action on Covid with inaction on inequality/climate change.
