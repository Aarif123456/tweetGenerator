<|startoftext|>@spursblogger @Geoff_Pearson The “misleading” part is indeed the paradox itself. Rail seats as “safer seating” / rail seats as “safe standing”.   However conceptualised I guess it does normalise rail seating in English football. Interesting, I suspected that it would lead to heavier stewarding in other parts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What will this mean for the policing of “standing” fans in other parts of Old Trafford? @Geoff_Pearson<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DrJoeIbs Thank you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just published - my article on the latest phase of the Safe Standing movement in football. Might be of interest for anyone researching networks political opportunities &amp; collective action &amp; those with a wider interest in supporters’ relations with the game  https://t.co/CR38aNq9uN<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mrjamesob @DPJHodges Outstanding James.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IainLindsey @_MarkMcCormack I agree too. Fascinating to track how Nolan’s films developed from Memento to something like Intersellar. On a different point, The Truman Show - Peter Wier (2 yrs earlier), I think, is more Baudrillian, and more impressive and relevant now than it was 20 yrs ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching rugby league is a staple diet of any northerner .... but the commentary on sky sports really is beyond narcissistic. Let the game speak for itself instead of 3 blokes chatting shit about themselves to themselves for 80 minutes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Wirral_Wonker @mattzarb @SebastianEPayne @OwenJones84 It’s not political point scoring.

<|startoftext|>This is a very good thread 👇🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayMcKenna87 I accept that. But Carragher’s post was deliberately premised upon a concern over a possible longer term suspension when the PL and EFL haven’t even formally announced they’re cancelling games. Football needs to come together as a community today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbarls Haha. You need a quick once over?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DrDaveWebber @solentfootball @solentuni This looks like a fantastic session.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carolecadwalla @ITV Keep that pressure on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonlansman I’m not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshleyJLowerson @prof_mark_james If you ever want a chat Ashley happy to share my experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshleyJLowerson It’s not about the final scene. It’s about the process, the characters which build the story. What you’re feeling is normal, we’ve all experienced it. Remind yourself why you’re doing it and go easy on yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoperCarl Fair enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoperCarl I can only account for myself, old man, brother and my mates. And our views on ourselves and United when we were shit. On a related note, not even sure why this matters to you as an Everton fan. But happy to understand why<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoperCarl Some’ City fans. Don’t essentialise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joelrookwood I meant my intention wasn’t (with reference to Clarke having played for us)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joelrookwood Intention wasn’t to make your tweet about City though there 😬🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joelrookwood Then we had Clarke at City a couple of years later reunited with Kendall (90-92). Scored 2 goals. He was shite for us. We had another Wayne too. Wayne ‘Bertie’ Biggins. Another shite player in our glorious history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrDaveWebber @MiguelDelaney Agree with this mate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheAnfieldWrap I’m a city fan but love this. 😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‘Work with fans’ (at all levels) is key here to delivering Safe Standing. It is fans after all who built this movement and secured these new political opportunities. And it is fans who will also hold Safe Standing to account if it doesn’t deliver what they have campaigned for<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NataliePaweleck @BBCRadioManc Suspect they will incorporate Rail Seating into the expansion of the North Stand. I know the hierarchy are pro Safe Standing at City<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MiguelDelaney Most normal people said this when he was appointed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This. Absolutely this. Key statistic is always what happens in both boxes. But particularly defence. Liverpool have conceded 14 goals all season. City 27. Had a huge impact on the relentless consistency of Liverpool and vulnerable inconsistency of City.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The exclamation mark is out. Be full on Trump caps lock next.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_PaulHayward I’ve never been to Old Trafford in the away end and seen such a narrow Utd side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All these Labour candidates are totally underwhelming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Corbynism with a “political backbone”. Deary me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That 2nd half by Everton was absolutely incredible. I can’t process it. One of the poorest performances I’ve ever seen in at this level. Reminded me of City under Stuart Pearce in a 1/4 final at Blackburn. Mind blowingly bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joelrookwood Decent fans aswell. You’ve got the lot. Enjoy it mate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gturv Isn’t this THE paradox though? When did we start measuring offside by elbows &amp; cock length? Since VAR was introduced. I’d take the odd mistake or two over this monstrosity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes you just need to take comfort and joy from the little things in life which bring humour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And #VAR is trying to micro-analyse these subjective interpretations. The game has gone utterly bonkers. But more importantly, too much technology dehumanises the spectacle for fans, players and officials. We’re past the point of no return. It’s not football anymore (2/2)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The problem with #VAR is not its infancy. There is a clear strong argument to use technology for objective measures like whether a ball is over the goal line. But the basic rules of the game (offside, handball, tackling) have over time become ‘too complex’ and subjective .. (1/2)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A self-inflicted catastrophe. The best analysis of VAR you’ll ever see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was over in October. Incredible side. Taken on the challenge set by Pep and City and moved the game to a new level in terms of consistency. Relentless. Focused. Will win the lot over the next couple of years.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PeteMillward79 @Gabriel_Pogrund @cazjwheeler @TomCalver2 @siddiqi_yas Absolutely ridiculous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@James_Treadwell Yes, I agree with this. But have we past the point of no return? How do ‘PC’ millenials from towns like Wigan who went to university &amp; are pro multiculturalism, reconcile with their white parents who also sneer at them as ‘middle class’ patronising ‘intellectuals’?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@James_Treadwell Or maybe identity does matter? Maybe that’s also a point here?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alan_Tonge And manager.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Piethagorus @Land_Of_Hull @lisanandy Does have an honest discussion about race, nationalism, identity, but one which also recognises progressives aren’t trying to ‘lecture’ or patronise them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Piethagorus @Land_Of_Hull @lisanandy It’s not one thing. There has been a culture war within towns like Wigan for 20 years. My fathers generation (many of whom voted Brexit) see me (the ‘liberal’ university educated) as the problem and I see them as the problem. There needs to be a reconciliation, one which ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Land_Of_Hull @lisanandy Wasn’t just that .... it was Corbyn too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1_jdean Don’t be so hard on yourself there. Let’s have a beer and discuss this. And figure it out.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Carra23 The broader issue here is the way in which the obsession with (techo) micro-analysis of football dehumanises the spectacle all in the pursuit of eliminating human error. (That’s ignoring how crap VAR itself is as a piece of technological kit)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WestHamMatters Its a fair argument, you may be right, but I’m just not sure Merkel and Macron would ‘publicly’ show their hand like that if they were softening. Be interesting to see what Varadkar says in the next few days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WestHamMatters Not necessarily mate, I suspect its more likely political manoeuvring/ positioning in terms of framing who is to blame when the backstop is not removed and a no deal may be an unintended (or intended) consequence.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DrTomWebb @henrywinter Agreed Tom. And that quest has placed unprecedented levels of pressure on referees as human beings.  I fear we’re past the point of no return however, and on this issue (more than any other) fans will fall out of love with why they fell in love with football in the first place<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrTomWebb @henrywinter This technology dehumanises football. However fans get what we deserve. We’re complicit in this ..... we’ve continued to go to games &amp; witnessed the accelerated neoliberalisation of football &amp; obsession with the logic of quantifiable progress.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@davemcardle @StefanoLawrence That pretty much sums up my view<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is some season for City. A domestic treble means more to the fans than a European trophy. Perhaps not the club, but certainly the fans. Over 35 years old. And without De Bruyne for large parts of the season.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chloewynne LOL @ your gifs. Was darker than turnkey on king street circa 98. I personally enjoyed the first 25 in particular. I found it suffocating in terms of suspense. Cant answer your question re: the dothraki<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chloewynne Want to start with that Arya scene? ‘You can take your own bloody pants off’.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chloewynne Loved the subtle juxtapositions plastered all over the bloody place. Especially the watchers on the wall. Lots of season 1 pastiche. Redemption theme.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rwilliams1947 He didnt miss the penalty in the first leg which was critical. Aguero did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_PaulHayward Simple. Look at Aguero from 12 yards out in the first leg. And Mahrez from 12 yards out at Anfield in the league. Two penalties which will probably cost City the two biggest trophies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MartinCloake Good luck in the semi Martin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mackin_john Interesting .... dont know anything about this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StefanoLawrence Mate, this is a Tory Party Broadcast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redrobe13 When I arrived at Fisher in 92, there wasnt a football team. Only rugby under Steve Mcleod. There may have been one prior, Im not sure but nothing from 92 to 94. Was only when a former everton trainee turned PE teacher / coach Jon Hill turned up when it changed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StefanoLawrence Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PKendrickWIG Brilliant. My old school. We didnt have a football side until 94 because it was so rugby focused having produced Edwards, Joynt, Cassidy et al. Great to hear this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Michelle_inHE Its certainly better than the view I have of @DrDaveWebber ‘s Liverpool FC shrine which includes two scarves, two tango football’s and toy football figures.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HeskethThomas @Tesco @chloewynne<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevenPowell4 Perhaps mate yeah. I think the intensity levels from both sides was outstanding and the ability to retrieve the ball from pressing in small spaces was incredible. David Silva not fit and missing De Bruyne added to the lack of technical precision in City’s final third play<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Outstanding game of football between two outstanding football sides.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@j_richo1990 I think it was also a way of reaffirming authenticity and loyalty - same when queuing up at Maine Road at 3am for a small allocation away end (playoff 1st leg semi final ticket vs wigan in 1999)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@j_richo1990 Defo wouldnt do it today! But it was more of a community experience .... sleeping bags, flasks, social interaction produced relationships &amp; connections - shared memories, histories, whereas today its a more isolating individualised experience<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@j_richo1990 Yes. I queued up with sleepeover (overnight) outside Central Park for a Challenge Cup Wembley ticket (Wigan Rugby League) early 1990s. It was rougher than Glastonbury<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We love you Harry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plethora. Lovely word Gaz.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@twcuddleston She’s late for her own funeral<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamCrafton_ But thats the problem. There never was a deal. Because its a paradox. It seeks to compromise and reconcile the 52/48% but ends up satisfying neither. No arithmetic for a hard border brexit and no appetite for a brexit in name only without a seat at the table.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamCrafton_ Adam, its unknown in many respects .... narrative and framing of Brexit changes when leave/remain discourse is replaced with deal/no deal. For some Ive spoken to ... they voted brexit to get a deal. And thats in a labour heartland (wigan).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamCrafton_ Premise is flawed. ‘Risk 17m’ voters assumes they all still feel the same 2 years after the referendum. Its now ‘no deal’ vs ‘people’s vote’ - I suspect many in parliament (both sides) will see the goal posts having moved once starring down the barrel of a ‘no deal’ gun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamCrafton_ Yes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>City are top with 32 points and De Bruyne has started 1 league game. Lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markdoidge Its absolutely about racism. Im from Wigan. I know what its about.<|endoftext|>
