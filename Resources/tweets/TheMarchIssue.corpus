<|startoftext|>Perhaps, you're one of the people engaging in the behaviors that contribute to the systematic oppression of black and brown people. Check yourself. Check those around you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't typically spend a lot of time on social media anymore, but I just had to say that everyone is touched by racism. If you don't think race affects you, then you're probably one of those tone-deaf people who sees people of color struggling, but choose to look the other way.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Wendys there. Had it not been for the fact that my orders are often wrong here, but I still remain brand-loyal.

<|startoftext|>@wendys finally, I could have forgiven the incorrect order in the first place, had it not been for the fact that the drive thru was empty when the order was screwed up. So, no excuse!

<|startoftext|>@wendys finger in my face. B) If the previous mgr acknowledged the mistake after doubling back, who the hell are you to get uppity with me about it??? c) If I disclosed that I didn't have the receipt, and you still agreed to replace my food on a Sunday, what difference does it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wendys on what effing planet does someone like me need to defraud a cretin like him out of $5.48?!?!?! Not only that, but in replacing my food, he STILL got the order wrong!

<|startoftext|>@wendys the wrong receipt from a purchase at another location on accident. Which shouldn't have mattered, because I told the previous mgr yesterday that I didn't even have the receipt and she said that was fine. He's a prick to me EVERY time I drive thru that location.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wendys do was hand me the bag, apologize, and go on about his day. Especially AFTER I had been told the previous day by Angelica, that a replacement would be given to me for free. Instead, this disrespectful ass, leans into the car and accuses me of stealing because I handed him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wendys Your racist manager (a guy whose name escapes me, but starts I think with the letter "F", just went off on me for requesting my meal be replaced after it was incorrectly made yesterday.
