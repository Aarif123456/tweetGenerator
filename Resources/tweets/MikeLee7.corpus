<|startoftext|>@adilray we all need to work together to rid the world of racism and it's ideology.  Clearly though the onus is on white people as we have systematically created the environment to protect our own interests whilst taking no care for the wider global community #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Racism on any level is horrendous. Implied or explicit, accidental or purposeful - there should be no allowance or excuse. #BlackLivesMatter #StandTogether<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>now im confused. Are we still on lockdown in Wales apart from the 5 mile rule, are business's opening, schools etc. Too many messages from too many Govt heads and not enough real detail in any of them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was a tragedy before this but now it looks at the very least a personal vendetta and at worst premeditated. This has to stop!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>it cannot just be me who is falling slowly in love with @jacindaardern . Made all the more tragic by realising it can never be and what I have to put up with instead with @BorisJohnson. Tragic #NZdoingitright<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson going all in with his support for Cummings.  A high risk, all or nothing strategy . Just waiting for fresh evidence to completely embarrass and undermine the Govt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>on a hot bank holiday weekend the Govt has just pressed the self destruct button and I fully expect a collective 'f..you' with regards to compliance. Meanwhile the rest of us are desperately trying to stay safe and do the same for others. Unbelievable #CumminsGate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson you have just made the job of the police impossible.  Let's see if we can figure out the excuse people will be giving when stopped on long journeys.  Do the right thing and do it today. Oh and make sure it is you facing the media this afternoon #cummings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Food_A4thought Amazing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dominic Cummings behaviour is deplorable generally but this recent act shows a contempt for everyone and everything. @BorisJohnson has to act swiftly and remove him. The electorate will not forget. No consequences is not acceptable<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DawnHFoster good morning. Having read your article and as a 'lay member' I would be very happy and open to discussing with you both the factual inaccuracies in your piece and anything else you would like clarity on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great atmosphere for the rugby at @tinyrebelbrewco yesterday and the male voice choir was a nice touch. See you next Saturday #6Nations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrewbensonf1 @chrissice It would be interesting to break down the demographic of the PPV audience.  Surely the 'next' generation is used to paying for live sport. As a 49 year old, I certainly am!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For dreadful 6 nations predictions, I am your man #6nations   Wales 24 - 27 Scotland  France 18 - 25 Ireland  Italy 15 - 35 England<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jacksonhull @insanelab @AntoniZolciak Very true. My brother in law is Polish and has a thriving voucher code business in Katowice. The talent in development has allowed the business to scale quickly and internationally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He is half right. Russia and the rest of the world are laughing. Shame he doesn't understand why #stablegenuis  https://t.co/oSFURg7Xrq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This certainly validates what I have seen on the ground during the last 3-4 years. More exciting growth to come in 2018/19  https://t.co/v8Jx63nxbU<|endoftext|>
