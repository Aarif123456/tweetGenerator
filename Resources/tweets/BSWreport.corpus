<|startoftext|>@971theticketxyt @patcaputo98 2020 has sucked . So much devastation, uncertainty We haven’t known what’s up or down at times. We have all craved normalcy only to find anything but that. But through all of the strife, the one shred of normalcy that we should ALL recognize is that the Lions still fucking suck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@leglessman They cant. The cap hit would be 32 million<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KyleBogey971 So trading stafford.  Good for both him and his family. However it's a death sentence for lions fans. Now matty p and Bobby q have legit reasons the Season would be a failure I mean normal.  Am I too far off base here @KyleBogey971<|endoftext|>
