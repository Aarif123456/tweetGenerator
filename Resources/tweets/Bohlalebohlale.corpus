<|startoftext|>@Likhovic_Gazi we can disuss Hazard now, my take: (brilliant player, had two good chances to impact the game but he failed)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#LIVCHE Hazard is more dangerous when breaking from the middle not playing as a target, the introduction of Gonzalo proved that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#klopp need to control this game better we are leading 2nil, hayibo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I told u🙈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was disappointed yesterday by an English commentary that kept on with Ahly danger as if #Sundowns was not playing or did not win 5-0⚽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Likhovic_Gazi #Salah goal?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Expect #Chelsea manager to introduce a striker now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#klopp needs #Mane to receive the ball more to feedoff Firmino other #keita is not picking the right pass or creating good moments for a 1-2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lungisa35 With less numbers in the middle #Liverpoolfc will control the game giving Fabinho time to pick a pass!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lungisa35 This also limit him from making those cross field pass going forward<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lungisa35 On paper the two offer speed on a break! Ideally also add numbers in the middle. A sign of a less confident manager<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mane🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Likhovic_Gazi They are playing on a counter, with William and Hazard<|endoftext|>
