<|startoftext|>@MikePulsifer @SpurlinKen @KamalaHarris Yes but she is Senator Kamala Harris not Congresswoman Kamala Harris.There is a difference.The Senate gives equal representation to small states because it’s about representing the state &amp; Congress or the House represents the people directly.#kamalaforthepeople #KamalaHarris2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NancyDelthia @KamalaHarris Sorry. So Military does use the M16, the AR15 is modeled after it &amp; used by law enforcement. My point is that civilians have no need for guns like those &amp; it shouldn’t be available to us. I just don’t want guns like these or any gun to get into the wrong hands. #MarchForOurLives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris Could we please make sure no one gets their hands on military grade guns like the AR-15? If you need a AR-15 to hunt &amp; kill animals instead of a normal hunting rifle then you should probably find a new hobby.

<|startoftext|>@llauralouisiana @CNNPolitics @CoryBooker would be great choice for her VP. I think both @BetoORourke and @CoryBooker would make her short list.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNNPolitics I really hope that @KamalaHarris runs for #President in 2020. She'd make a great president because she cares about #America, #HealthCareForAll , #climatechange , #EqualPayForAll , #Dreamers and so much more. She deserves a real chance! I'd #Vote for her. #KamalaHarris2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrBobbyBones Please don't do it @mrBobbyBones ! As one of your many fans I think they'd all agree with me when I say that I want you to find true love.
