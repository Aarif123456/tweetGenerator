<|startoftext|>BuzzFeed says it will focus on the US coverage. According to the company's statement, the decision to pull the plug on operations in the UK and Australia was taken both "for economic and strategic reasons".   https://t.co/8iYhelPLNf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The news comes as BuzzFeed experiences financial pain due to the industry-wide decline in advertising. The company hugely relies on ads for its revenue, and the economic crisis has seriously hurt advertising.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>📰Industry news: BuzzFeed is ending its local news operations in the UK and Australia  In Britain, it has furloughed 10 staff members.

<|startoftext|>@jakubgornicki thanks for your comments and for the well-prepared workshop on how to do digital events.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Digital conferences are the meatless burgers of the events industry. Great in theory, but convincing people to switch over means you need to get them just right. But it looks like they will stay with us even after the COVID era.  https://t.co/Qty5fz3Xa5<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>(3/4) Almost all media saw a massive jump in traffic in March. But a “flight to quality” meant that tabloids underperformed as audiences tuned into public broadcasters.  https://t.co/KTTw3iOIsh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(2/4) Why the difference? @j_parus thinks that countries that went into quarantine earlier saw a bigger spike in traffic.  Spain, Italy, and France are among the countries most affected by the outbreak. Ukraine also locked down relatively early in March.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(1/4) Most countries saw a massive bump in media traffic as the world went into lockdown in March. But it was far from equal.  https://t.co/DDqZKR5Q4l<|endoftext|>
