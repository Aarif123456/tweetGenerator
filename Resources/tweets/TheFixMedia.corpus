<|startoftext|>(2/2) üìç On a more optimistic note, the bulk of South Europe has seen significant improvements. Top performer Portugal jumped 16 positions to rank 10th in 2020.  üìç Ukraine also illustrates a major breakthrough. It raised up to 33 positions from 129 in 2015 to 96 in 2020.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(1/2)  üìç The decline in Central Europe is perhaps the biggest story. Poland leads this deterioration of press freedom (-44 points since 2015).  üìç Some other CEE countries also do not look optimistic. Czechia, Hungary, and Slovakia see their press freedom shrinking.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>(2/4) Why the difference? @j_parus thinks that countries that went into quarantine earlier saw a bigger spike in traffic.  Spain, Italy, and France are among the countries most affected by the outbreak. Ukraine also locked down relatively early in March.<|endoftext|>
