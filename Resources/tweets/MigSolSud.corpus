<|startoftext|>@CCScottLA @blobert @KayColesJames @Heritage Oh the Irony. You should be saying that to the destroyers, not me. You help get ball rolling downhill &amp; what gets run over matters not one degree when past transgressions are judged and property wrecked for the sake of justice in 2020. Shouldn’t be hard to grasp.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CCScottLA @blobert @KayColesJames @Heritage What’s the point of looking at history through the filter of today’s standards. This article is based on testimony by a rival of Columbus that wanted his position, Columbus spent his life refuting.

<|startoftext|>@robertdos @bscovy1 @drsimonegold Biden knows it’s a fraud and so does Whitmer. Still they virtue signal and hope to keep people like you in the fold. Many of the people on this tweet know it’s a fraud just like I do. Even the WHO is reversing on the lockdowns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robertdos @bscovy1 @drsimonegold I was talking about my own typo. You can’t read. Be like #JohnMcAfee he mocks the mask mandate and flaunt’s it because his mask is just as effective as any other cover you use. Negligible  https://t.co/d1KhHhTUka<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timkaine Which Indigenous People? These. Columbus is a much better example of moving forward for the greater good, than a race hustler like you.  https://t.co/g8RWGRTlNw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C12H22O11Bitter @blobert @KayColesJames @Heritage Of course. I agree wholeheartedly. History and modernity is filled with barbarism. People use it for a means to an end. Columbus is used as an example of the evil west personified. It’s bunk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robertdos @bscovy1 @drsimonegold I read it, but said “tead” it. You can use your haughty phrases, I don’t care. The use of masks to stop viral infections have never been or will EVER be an effective barrier for public use. This is what people wear that study viruses use to ensure safety not an ill fitting POS  https://t.co/gXMyNGzWCp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CCScottLA @blobert @KayColesJames @Heritage Columbus ordered his men not plunder &amp; punished those that did, while giving protection to a local natives. Columbus was no monster, Howard Zinn did a great job demonizing everything relating to Western Culture, just as you do &amp; carry that quest forward.  https://t.co/0AOOpn38bJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blobert @KayColesJames @Heritage Who said he was perfect? The Egyptians, Huns, Mongols, Romans, Greeks, North American Indians, South American Indians. All were conquering groups that warred and used their captives as they wanted. Eunuchs in China, Aztecs were prolific in human sacrifice. Play your part Marxist  https://t.co/2wbbwoyaf6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robertdos @bscovy1 @drsimonegold The same fight raged in 1918. The effects of wearing a mask are negligible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robertdos @bscovy1 @drsimonegold Then just as the WHO did earlier in the year came out with how the virus spread by aerosol and promptly said it was “draft” and ooopsie shouldn’t have been posted.  It’s not an accident, it’s suspect.  https://t.co/qsJHjyrnPX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robertdos @bscovy1 @drsimonegold TEAD IT, linked out to the other studies. I could send you the other studies that say the opposite.

<|startoftext|>@SharylAttkisson ...as if the method used to spy on you is complicated. Its not and the entire FISA argument to me is Big Brother was already spying and went down FISA path to try and give legitimacy to a plan they already hatched TRUMP’s win blew that up and we see #veryfakenews in full effect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SharylAttkisson This is why I hate the #MSM for being obviously obtuse about Trump’s statement “Obama wiretapped me” Big Brother violated your 4th Amendment rights by hacking your computer then steals your hardware when you let them gather evidence for case.
