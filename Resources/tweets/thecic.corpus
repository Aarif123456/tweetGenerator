<|startoftext|>"Lloyd Axworthy is right, we need a massive increase in our development assistance. We also need to have a massive increase in our military and, sure, more diplomats and more embassies. ... and an ability to engage in grand strategy" to direct these these resources<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"A power-based foreign policy means starting with what our citizens need" so much of which is determined by what happens beyond our borders. "If we are to protect the prosperity, the security, and now the health of our citizens" we need to use power to impact what happens abroad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For @benrowswell, the alternative to the Pearsonian tradition is a Canadian foreign policy focussed on power. That means closing the "dramatic and growing gap between what we say we want to accomplish and what we actually accomplish.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There’s also a strong component that is about reinforcing our national identify. But "I think we need to get past this identity building or storytelling component of our foreign policy to confront the real dangers” that come with the end of the rules-based international order.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>En plus, les contraintes contre le conflits militaries sont plus faibles.

<|startoftext|>In an age of deep integration in the world, this is what popular sovereignty requires. Being a democracy means ensuring that citizens are the final repository of power. With globalization and hostile foreign countries, Canada must amass power so our citizens remain sovereign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Instead, @benrowswell states that Canada should place power at the centre of our foreign policy decisions. Our goal should be to band together with “countries that have similar values and interests” so that our collective ability to secure outcomes for our citizens prevails.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the article, @benrowswell explains how Canada is in an “incredibly precarious position” as more powerful states pursue unilateral actions informed by populist agendas, disregarding the rules-based international order which has been the basis of our foreign policy for 75 years.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@benrowswell concludes by saying that Canada must practice “strategic patience” meaning “all of the anguish that the two Michaels are going through, there probably is longer to come until we get the change from the Chinese government at the root of their tragedy.” #cdnpoli #cdnfp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor who are being held on trumped-up charges in China "are suffering on behalf of us all” continues @benrowswell as he outlines the human tragedy at the centre of this debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benrowswell reflected on his own time in the Canadian Foreign Service describing how “I’ve represented our country in some very dangerous places where I could have been taken hostage” which makes it “hard to watch this and not think, wow, there but for the grace of God go I.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CIC President @benrowswell was on @CTV_PowerPlay today with @MasonPeggy from the Rideau Institute and @onglynette from UofT to discuss the #MengWanzhou prisoner swap debate where he talked about the human cost of this dispute and his belief that Canada should stand firm<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Recently, former @CICVancouver President and Canadian Ambassador to the UN in Geneva from 2003-2007, Paul Meyer, sat down with @ict4peace to discuss cyber diplomacy and his recent work on international cyber policy.   Listen to the full conversation here:  https://t.co/7Dbe2GyEtb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Copanellists Robert Fowler and Lynette Ong argued we should distance ourselves from the U.S. as well. To @benrowswell, we should ask a simple question when considering difficult foreign policy options: "will this add to or detract from, our power as a nation?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"But if you look back to Canada's international history, we have shown we can play power politics. When we band together with the right allies on the right issues, we have prevailed against countries that are every bit as nasty as China is now"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"All the assumptions we have for how we will keep ourselves safe, for how we will keep ourselves prosperous, have to be rethought...

<|startoftext|>“We have to hold firm, resist pressure where possible, put pressure back on China collectively, and exercise strategic patience”   @benrowswell concludes with this advice, but do you think Canada should choose a different approach to resolve this dispute? #cdnpoli #cdnfp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Andrew Scheer’s proposal that Canada coordinate with other countries like Australia to join forces in resisting China merits attention, according to @benrowswell. Listen to the whole interview starting from 10:25:  https://t.co/3RN5Up7CiQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“Exchanging #MengWanzhou for the two Michaels being held in China on trumped-up charges would set a dangerous precedent which would “empower China in future conflicts” with Canada and other countries, continues @benrowswell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“This is one of those difficult situations where the interests of two Canadians is in conflict with the interests of all of us.”   Speaking to @AM900CHML, CIC President @benrowswell responds to the latest in #Canada's China dispute. #cdnpoli #cdnfp<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Canada contributed an average of 700 peacekeeping troops during its previous two terms on the Security Council. With its 2019 contribution of just 50 personnel, is this part of the reason why Canada was unable to win a seat on the UNSC?   https://t.co/732cmWCxQk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Canadians thank you too - a tremendous effort by our nations diplomats, up against tough odds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“Coming to terms with the end of the rules-based international order is not something we can do overnight, but it’s urgent we do so.” Hopefully the shock of today’s loss will help us to make the transition more quickly - @benrowswell reflecting on Canada's UN loss on @PnPCBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pearson excelled at building institutions and alliances that helped channel the actions of the powerful. But “the great powers are no longer playing with any regard for the rules of these institutions. The game we need to learn to play now is that of power politics.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“A seat on the Security Council was the apogee” of foreign policy in the age of Pearson. “Perhaps the message that we may need to take away today is that it’s time to bury Pearsonian diplomacy.” We are now in a world of power politics.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today’s loss was a real blow to Canada on the world stage. “It shows that we have hit a dead end in our #foreignpolicy” CIC President @benrowswell explained on @PnPCBC this evening. #cdnpoli #UNSC #cdnfp  https://t.co/1pba1GIRKM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We couldn't agree more<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With our partners at @GlobalCanadaOrg and @CanWaCH, we are ready to lead in the formulation of a new Canadian foreign policy to match a new global reality -- with the voices of everyday Canadians front and centre.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's time for a foreign-policy review.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarshallLeslie @CICSask @CICVancouver Thank you for leting us know Marshall! This has been fixed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Keep track of today's vote with @CanadaUN expected to cast its ballot at 12:30 pm ET and first round results around 4:00 pm ET. If two countries from Canada's group are unable to obtain votes from 2/3rds of all UN member states, voting resumes tomorrow #cdnpoli #CanadaUNSC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But a Security Council seat need not be a popularity contest. “we should be at as many tables of the powerful as possible so that we’ve got leverage with powerful countries” @benrowswell explained.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"If we were to lose twice in two successive decades with two different political parties, that could really be quite an indictment of Canada's role in the world" says @benrowswell describing this vote as a bellwether for Canadian international influence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"For better or worse, [the Canadian government] has staked a lot of our national pride on it."   Speaking to @atRachelGilmore from @CTVNews, CIC President @benrowswell describes the stakes for today's Security Council election:  https://t.co/WqLrQotjhb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>20 Indian soldiers and an unknown number of Chinese troops were killed during recent clashes along the disputed #IndiaChina border.

<|startoftext|>“Canadians do not have the luxury of withdrawing from a world in disorder. We owe it to our dead to make sure this catastrophic failure never happens again,” @benrowswell goes on to say<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Declaring #COVID19 as a "catastrophic failure of the international system," @benrowswell says Canada should build a foreign policy that "starts with the needs of our citizens" by "taking full account of power to secure the international cooperation Canada needs.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“Now that order has given way to disorder, it’s time for a new foreign policy based on this new reality.”  Writing in the @globeandmail, CIC President @benrowswell describes the urgent need for Canada to re-imagine its foreign policy:  https://t.co/Tr0rqbrsrD #cdnpoli #CanadaUNSC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>McNee’s argument rests on the assumption the rules-based international order still exists. Do you agree? #cdnpoli Would the concerted efforts of middle powers in the Security Council actually constrain U.S. and China?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(2) “This rules-based international order is imperfect, but it remains the best hope to prevent a world where might makes right” and (3) Canada should use a seat on the Security Council “to fight for multilateralism and international institutions, starting with the UN.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(1) “The great global challenges require more collaboration among nations, not less. Yet, the institutions that allow for such co-operation are increasingly under attack from the great powers’ aggressive pursuit of their own interests”<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"The majority of threats facing our citizens come from outside our borders.

We must think for ourselves but act with others.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Frankly, skipping a year may be the best outcome for the ongoing relevance and effectiveness of the G7, to avoid the kind of confrontation that would put future summits in jeopardy.” @benrowswell<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>..and to invite others to come here and share with us their experiences with populism that we can learn from.   Let us take the opportunity of this moment to find the resolve to create stronger democracy in all our countries." @benrowswell #thedisruption #cdnpoli #populism  https://t.co/m2QsNzeCpy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Don't play the game of populists, don't let it become the politics of your country. We should be standing up for the truth.  Where do we go from here? This is an attempt to move from analysis to action. This is meant to help us understand populism in Canada..." @benrowswell(1/2)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Closing Remarks from @benrowswell:   Today gives me some hope that we are moving along in this discussion, getting past the 'oh my god is this happening' moment and can discuss solutions. One thing we can all do is doing a better job of understanding people on the other side.  https://t.co/HvXX26Qg9m<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>'What we have to appreciate in politics and policy is the role of emotion. It is an important fact in how people see the world, and the challenge is always how to give light to reason through emotion. Passion is good but we need reason and a commitment to evidence.' @BobRae48<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In response to the same question, @BobRae48 : 'One of the most discombobulating elements of populism has been the assertion that there are different truths and different facts. That is dangerous, as we enter a territory where anyone can say anything and still be right.'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Question from floor" 'Does evidence still matter in politics?'  @lraitt: 'The both sad and good thing about policy is that it's evidence based, and there is still politics in the policy. If we only rely on data &amp; modelling, then I don't think we will be successful as a government<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>'It is possible that we will have a populist movement but what it would currently be looking for is the charisma and political entrepreneur in a leader who can piece it all together. Whether it is electable is another question.' @lraitt #TheDisruption #cdnpoli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>'The Conservative Party of Canada is an alliance between economic conservatives (libertarians, etc) and social conservatives. That alliance has worked for many years, but when that social fabric starts to tear that's when the alliance becomes unstable' @lraitt  https://t.co/U8IzM6LuPh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the centre-left here has been resistant to change. The comments we've heard speak to a continued risk that people will turn to easy answers to complex questions. It takes little to create dry ground that can easily be inflamed, &amp; progressives need to prepare. @BobRae48 (2/2)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our big challenge remains that, people are asking fundamental questions about the economy and what will be good for them, and these are not questions to which we have convincing answers. For all the things that have been said by the panel on European politics... (1/2) @BobRae48<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>'Something we have not looked at enough is gender. There is such a large gender gap now between parties, and it's something we need to consider when looking at leaders'  @BobRae48 #TheDisruption #cdnpoli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>'Good progressive leadership is becoming jard to find. The things we are asking politicians to do are such a wide range of things that it's a remarkable person who can bring it all together.' @BobRae48<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Standards of living have not been growing and people are not doing better. People are saying that 'the standard of lifting all boats has not continued, my boat has not lifted' " @BobRae48<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>'It's only natural that people say they want some degree of control over the changes that happen to their life, which is why they don't want a border that's open all the time.' @BobRae48<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From @BobRae48: The 90's represented a time where political standards started to change. n 1996, there was anger from the public about social changes around them (jobs, economy, etc). We've seen a strong intensification of these feelings since then. #TheDisruption #cdnpoli  https://t.co/9Nc8kdPOXu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Panel starting now with @lraitt and @BobRae48 on The (Uncertain) Future of Canadian Politics  https://t.co/gtlU2npCvS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Matt Browne: If you are a newspaper, or TV/radio station, then you have a responsibility for content you promote, especially political content. However there are no restrictions on Facebook &amp; social media, who also don't self-police. In terms of populism, this is a major problem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Italy's 'Five Star' populists changed the way parties win elections. Previously to reach majority you had to make sense to the median voter. Now, they create maximum engagement in niches, for the purpose of collection under a broad anti-establishment agenda." Says @giulianode<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From @giulianode "The central populist promise is the humiliation of the elites and the establishment: of mainstream media, politicians, media etc. And they realize that agenda every day they are in office."  https://t.co/4Tlb4djYGR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5. Do deliver at the same rate as populists promose. People demand efficiency and opponents of populism will need to meet this demand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3. Do communicate. Politicians do not communicate underlying principles or values.   4.  Do stand up and fight. Fight for what we preach and believe in. The battle against populism is a battle of courage and fear. Attitude counts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Schuler:  5 Do's in the fight against populism:  1. Do listen. Some politicians are good speakers but most are awful listeners. They must learn to listen again.  2. Do get reconnected. The established political parties have become disconnected from society. Pop the elitist bubble<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klaus Schuler:  3 Dont's in the fight against populism:   1. Do not let fear overwhelm you 2. Do not make right wing populists the centre of your political universe. 3. Do not stare like a rabbit at the snake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So as the political system gets more complex, society is becoming less patient. And this is what populists are taking advantage of.   (2/2)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klaus Schuler: When you ask Germans what they want from the political system, you get surprising results. People miss efficiency of the political system. 80% of Germans say that political decision making takes too long. 2/3 say that no progress is happening at all... (1/2)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klaus Schuler: The old will not last, &amp; the new has not been established yet. We live in an in-between period. This means the principles for human social co-existance have been re-opened. Established principles like the market economy and liberal democracy are no longer a given.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klaus Schuler: Populism is the largest challenge to the political system in my lifetime. And the established political parties have yet to find a precise solution to it.  https://t.co/SmsrqckJRW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Matt Browne: Populist-support in Britain, exists largely in towns where jobs are provided by Japanese car makers. Sentiments against the EU there are high, but these car companies are located within these towns entirely for the purpose of exporting to the EU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>he moved for a referendum on the issue, a huge strategic failure, which has led to the rise of Nigel Farage and his type of thinking. (2/2)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Matt Browne: Many of the issues where populists have been leading, you can point to strategic failures by opponents of populism. When David Cameron won the 2015 election, the EU was no higher than 12th on the priority list of voters. But for the purposes of party unity, ... (1/2)  https://t.co/p9UZu5Z2P5<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>'This is a moment where Canada could potentially get ambitious in its international affairs,' says Canadian International Council president Ben Rowswell (@benrowswell).   https://t.co/EyEYjiE1sB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"And now in 2019? The world is equally divided, the situation equally worrisome.  What is Canada going to do about it this time?" Get the full interview between @BobRae48 Rae and @BenRowswell at  https://t.co/NgEqAadYhC #cdnpoli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"The 1960s was also a really unstable time in international politics: the depths of the Cold War; incredible poverty; coup d’etats happening all around the world. At that point Lester Pearson came up with a viable response to deal with all the instability" @benrowswell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"100 years ago Sir Robert Borden came back from negotiating the Versailles Treaty convinced that the world remained a dangerous place. He set up an organization with branches across the country to get Cdns focussed on international issues. The CIC is born out of that initiative"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the @pstripespodcast with @BobRae48, Ben Rowswell talks about this week's conference "Canadians Changing the World with @GlobalCanadaOrg: "Part of this conference was to look back at what Canada has been able to change in the world in the past"  https://t.co/NgEqAadYhC  https://t.co/UGKlKba0Q1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The big question in #foreignpolicy is this: “What do we do with that power? When I’ve been talking to the Canadians that make up our 15 branches across the country, it’s clear they want Canada to be more ambitious."  https://t.co/NgEqAadYhC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Canada has power.” Explains @thecic’s @benrowswell. "We have an ability to shape what happens outside our borders. We’re the 10th largest economy in the world. We can deploy highly professional troops, &amp; we can convince other countries to do what we want them to do."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just out! New podcast Political Stripes, Episode 10: #ForeignPolicy with @BenRowswell  https://t.co/NgEqAadYhC Host Bob Rae calls the episode “a great primer for listeners looking to get a handle on Canadian foreign policy” #cdnpoli  https://t.co/WXd9SKoXb7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“The interruption of a few summits doesn’t help. But the disruption we’re seeing in the streets of Santiago pale in comparison to the disruptions in the international order we’re seeing more broadly.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“There’s a remarkable wave of protests taking place across the world right now from Hong Kong to Lebanon to Chile,” said @benrowswell. "The balance of power between states and their populations seems to be shifting. The states have less power than they used to."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Chile’s cancellation of two upcoming summits is a sign of a weakening world order that Prime Minister Trudeau and his fellow world leaders need to confront, says the head of a Canadian foreign policy think-tank." #cdnpoli  https://t.co/MQLBheexVa<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The idea that international aid is charity is completely false. It’s an act of collective self-interest. It’s putting hard resources at work in projecting our influence. We’re trying to shape what the world looks like outside our borders.  https://t.co/XuDySrHq6U<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wish we could be in #Vancouver right now to hear one of Canada's most experienced war correspondents share his call to our nation to take international security seriously @CICVancouver #firstdebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unusual statement by @AndrewScheer toward the end of the debate on #foreignpolicy, that he supports the right of #Israel to exist. So does every other party leader, and every serious candidate to represent Canadians. What is his purpose in stating the obvious?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Canada needs to be the Anti-Trump" according to @ElizabethMay, and @theJagmeetSingh calls on @AndrewScheer to explicitly denounce the American president. Should Canada's foreign policy necessarily start from a rejection of the U.S.? #firstdebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Andrew Scheer boasts about being banned from #Russia - though of course @cafreeland holds that distinction as well. Good to see Canada's two largest parties share firmness in opposing Putin's abuse of international norms #firstdebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not so sure the effort by the #Green leader to revive 1950s-style #peacekeeping as a priority will be particularly relevant - so many effective ways to address conflict, not just Blue Helmets #firstdebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow - @ElizabethMay acknowledges a threat that is even more urgent than #climatechange in the Leaders' #firstdebate: nuclear proliferation. Weren't expecting that one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the #firstdebate @andrewscheer is doing better on #immigration, arguing that being humane requires effective administration of immigration and refugee policy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fair question by @inklesspw  to @AndrewScheer on his defence of #Brexit - do you still support it amid the meltdown in Britain as we speak? We didn't quite catch the answer... #firstdebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But @theJagmeetSingh changes the topic to a criticism of trade agreements, not so sure that qualifies as top priority when so many Canadians support trade agreements. Paul Wells right to say the debate lost steam with this change of topic #firstdebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the leaders's #firstdebate, @ElizabethMay get it right - the fate of Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig is the most urgent issue in our international relations today<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Congratulations @jacqui_oneill for your appointment as Canada's first Ambassador for Women, Peace and Security! You bring so much value to our board of directors and now you get to bring that value to our nations' presence on the world stage.  https://t.co/chgWFKg48S<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Building a new alliance that extends beyond the West will prove challenging. But that’s the kind of challenge Canada has excelled at in the past. It’s time to unite the world’s democracies once again." @benrowswell at #KCIS2019 #cdnpoli  https://t.co/zyU7xAdD9P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"But by the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty on April 4, 1949, 12 liberal democracies committed themselves to the defence of one another.  We subordinated our sovereignty to the goal of maximizing the power they would yield together."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"In 1946 when Canadians first found out how deeply the Soviet Union had interfered in our country, no one imagined that the world’s democracies would respond to the growing threat by building a new alliance." CIC's @benrowswell at #theKCIS  https://t.co/9MChKP0Lwr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>... (c) simultaneous threats to liberal democracy at both the domestic as well as international levels; and (d) a fierce debate within democracies on over whether sovereignty is best pursued by collaborating with or by remaining independent of others"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CIC President @benrowswell at #KCIS2019: “there are intriguing parallels between the late 1940s and the world order today: (A) a shifting global balance of power; (b) brazen behaviour by states rising to challenge the rules-based international order...  https://t.co/8y2hTQUIU1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Canada never achieved the full extent of political and economic integration that it sought for NATO, but because we pushed so hard for the closest possible union, the resulting treaty produced an alliance more tightly aligned that anyone would have predicted" @benrowswell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"When UK Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin first put the idea of a transatlantic security pact to the U.S., he insisted that Canada at the table.  He knew our diplomats would propose a more ambitious degree of integration, and press more firmly than any others."  https://t.co/WOyvsObEzd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Holmes argued that Canada had influence because it was aligned with other liberal democracies. But inside that alliance, we retained the ability to set our own course.  Canada was both allied and autonomous, and derived power from both of those characteristics."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The most illustrious president of @thecic, John Holmes, coined the term “middle power” to describe Canada's role in the world.

<|startoftext|>"Today is a show of force. There is nothing a dictator fears more than his citizens organizing by the millions in open defiance. That is real power at work.

They are showing a uniquely Canadian way to promote democracy" @benrowswell   https://t.co/42HcCfCqAu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"He is likely to stay in power as long as he possibly can. So it really will depend on others in Maduro's administration and in the security forces abandoning him and not he, himself, deciding to run off into the sunset" @benrowswell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I think the [Canadian] government's shown some real backbone in their approach to Venezuela. This is the first time, and I was a diplomat for 25 years — the first time that I've seen Canada openly disagree with the United States on a major issue in Latin America." @benrowswell<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"What’s uniquely Canadian about the approach is that we are helping organize a multilateral response that is following the lead of Venezuelans." @benrowswell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Third the government announced $53 million in support for humanitarian assistance, making Canada one of the most generous countries in responding to the Venezuelan crisis. This is Canada stepping up to a real leadership role, in stark contrast of the United States."@benrowswell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Secondly the Prime Minister chaired the Lima Group which means that the full authority of the Canadian government is now invested in the strategy that Canada is helping pursue in Venezuela." @benrowswell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"This is a really big day for Canadian diplomacy. Canada has done 3 things in the last 24 hours. First, Chrystia Freeland disagreed with military intervention, a direct disagreement with the United States." @benrowswell #cdnpoli #Venezuela #LimaGroup  https://t.co/lWO7FapCSJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"It is unlikely that the US is seriously planning a military intervention. It is more likely that is bluster by the President. There are no American troops stationed near Venezuela so the thought of American troops rolling down the streets of Caracas is pure fiction" @benrowswell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Their own children are dying when they go to the emergency wards because of lack of medicine.  Any messages to them that encourage them to embrace this popular movement would be extremely helpful, and yes, relieving humanitarian suffering would be part of that" @benrowswell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"The [Venezuelan] military is on the fence. They are genuinely thinking through whether they are going to stick by the previous president or get behind the transitional government. The rank and file of the armed forces themselves are suffering from malnutrition." @benrowswell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"This is a Venezuelan movement being driven by the Venezuelan people to reclaim their sovereignty. The international community can support that through assistance for elections, delivery of humanitarian assistance, and for outside states to stop threatening force." @benrowswell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CIC President @benrowswell on the value of today's Lima Group meeting: "This group represents Latin America - it is entirely legitimate [that the region] lead the international response in support of a peaceful and constitutional change of power." #cdnpoli  https://t.co/JxGvjwItSS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>[In response to US oil sanctions] "When you cut off the principal source of income to the country, that's ultimately going to hurt individual Venezuelan people. The sanctions are not helping the Venezuelans in their struggle to regain popular sovereignty." @benrowswell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"This a lonely time for Canada to be standing up for democracy because the president of the US has not. The approach that Canada has been taking has been very much to support the citizens of Venezuela." @benrowswell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Canadians have this innate sense of the primacy of sovereignty. We understand how important it is to be able to take our own decisions, free from interference. We're united around consensus that the question of who governs Venezuela must be up to Venezuelans." @benrowswell<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>CIC President @benrowswell in the @globeandmail: [In responding to the crisis in #Venezuela] over the past 18 months... the Trudeau government has carved out a uniquely Canadian approach to democracy promotion.  https://t.co/WnI5JlyRVc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"It’s been made abundantly clear in Venezuela that the vast majority of people back one person, but the people that have the guns back the other. That situation can’t last forever." - @benrowswell on @CTVNationalNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"[The armed forces] are saying they support Maduro, but they haven't deployed their forces in any way to arrest this person who's authority they do not recognize. There is clearly confusion on the ground and on where the winds will turn." @benrowswell at @PnPCBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"This is not a US story. It's a Venezuelan story, it's a Latin American story, and we are there supporting Venezuelans and Latin Americans." @benrowswell at @PnPCBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Canada is not following the United States. The US has irresponsibly said that they would be willing to consider all options, including military, which is outrageous and wrong. Canada is not saying that at all." @benrowswell at @PnPCBC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"This is not about the US. This is a story about Venezuela, Venezuelans have been taking to the streets time after time under Maduro because they want to be able to choose their government." @benrowswell on @PnPCBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"We don't know yet whether this new interim President will end up enjoying the support of the armed forces, or whether they will stay with the current President, whether it will resolve itself peacefully, or whether there will be violence."  @benrowswell on @PnPCBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Canada is supporting the National Assembly, which is the democratically elected institution of the Venezuelan government. In doing so, it's supporting democracy." @benrowswell on @PnPCBC  https://t.co/w19WurVjUh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“C’est un situation très urgente au niveau humanitaire et j’espère que le Canada et les autres pays se préparent pour la provision des nourriture et des médicaments lorsqu’il y a un gouvernement au pouvoir à Caracas qui est prêt à accepter cet appui." @BenRowswell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“Maudro est très visiblement pas appuyé par le people Vénézuélien et l’Assemblée nationale l’est. Alors c’est pour ça que les espoirs de la communauté international se reposent sur la personne de Juan Guaido" @BenRowswell   https://t.co/h7tf0iLSTb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“We are going to be tested by hostile foreign powers, whether its China, Russia or anyone else; and that’s because the relationship we have with the United States is a source of power, both for the US and for Canada. It’s something to defend.”@benrowswell  https://t.co/z97eIkoOBE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“The United States has said that they would be prepared to use all means necessary to support the [Venezuelan] transition. This is fundamentally undemocratic because having some foreign military choose the  government is the opposite of populist sovereignty.” @BenRowswell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[In response to the U.S. reaction] “Just be quiet and let the Venezuelans speak for themselves. They are coming to the streets, showing that Maduro does not have support, and that they want change. The story needs to be about Venezuela.” @benrowswell  https://t.co/ICmv50Wa79<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“We are being singled out for punishment by China precisely because of our relationship to the United States.

<|startoftext|>"The rest of the world is watching this, and the way that we frame the discussion will be picked up and we should watch how the other countries of the world are starting to talk about this and who’s frame they seem to accept.” @benrowswell  #cdnpoli  https://t.co/NwLEB4iwCp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Neither Canada nor China are going to be able to force the other to change the way they do things. Neither have sufficient leverage. We’re looking at a long period of stasis.” @benrowswell at @ctv_powerplay #cdnpoli  https://t.co/NwLEB4iwCp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I think #Canada’s in relatively good position because we traditionally have been excellent at banding together and creating meaningful alliances with a large number of very powerful countries", @benrowswell to @CdnPress  https://t.co/omwHxfs3td #cdnpoli #China<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"The collective power of like-minded liberal democracies could help #Canada assert its position in an increasingly splintered world", CIC President @benrowswell added. @CdnPress #China #cdnpoli  https://t.co/omwHxfJERN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“When #China executed a British national named Akmal Shaikh on drug smuggling charges in 2009, the episode was terribly damaging to relations between the #UK and China”, @benrowswell to @CdnPress  https://t.co/omwHxfJERN #cdnpoli #internationalrelations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Canadians are divided as to whether #China should be seen primarily as a partner or as a threat, @benrowswell told @CdnPress. “If a Canadian is executed in China, it will tip the balance in favour of the latter and it will take years and years for the relationship to recover”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“This crisis will get worse before it gets better. At some point there will be a government that will accept #humanitarianaid to deal with the massive shortages, so we should be talking to other international institutions about how we might respond to that” @benrowswell @CBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“It’s right for #Canada to stand up for the popular sovereignty of #Venezuela in the way that it has done. The sovereignty of Venezuela does not belong to President #Maduro, it belongs to the citizens and the voters of Venezuela”, @benrowswell at @CBCNews #cdnpoli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“There are certain kinds of loans that a country can only get with a legitimate government in place. The Venezuelan government is already isolated on the international scene and it's just getting more isolated”, @benrowswell @CBCNews  https://t.co/p8q7ZZSUwd #internationalaffairs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“The Venezuelan people want to have a government in place that will turn this around. That is what @NicolasMaduro has deprived them of in his decision to steal the election last year”, CIC President @benrowswell at @CBCNews #Venezuela #internationalaffairs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How bad is the economic crisis in #Venezuela? “Every family in Venezuela knows someone who has died because they couldn’t get basic medicine for basic medical conditions”, CIC President @benrowswell at @CBCNews  https://t.co/p8q7ZZSUwd #cdnpoli #internationalaffairs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“I wouldn’t rule out a number of #diplomats being expelled. But kicking out all the diplomats of one particular embassy is an extraordinary measure. It would be a massive overreaction, and it would damage #Venezuela more than it would damage #Canada”, @benrowswell at @CBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“#Venezuela will certainly know that any measure they take against our #diplomats will immediately be reciprocated. The potential punishment of losing their diplomats in Ottawa will weigh heavily on them”, CIC President @benrowswell at @CBCNews  https://t.co/p8q7ZZSUwd #cdnpoli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Why is #Canada being singled out?

<|startoftext|>"#Canada is not alone in this; we are one of 13 countries [in the region] that has declared #Maduro’s presidency illegitimate”, CIC President @benrowswell at @CBCNews #cdnpoli<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"#SaudiArabia found out that they had picked on the wrong country, and it ended really badly for them.

<|startoftext|>"#Canada is symbolic of something in the international system.

<|startoftext|>"#China is experimenting with the former right now, to see how it can throw its weight around. But it's actually frittering away the other kind of power.
