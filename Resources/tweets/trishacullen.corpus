<|startoftext|>@darkroutes Oh no. I’d make sure you’d get Florida pricing., I’ll start working on that for ya! 👍🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last night, as results came in,  I watched my 17 year old daughter as she cry her eyes out.  She has lost so much in her life- COVID took away her Senior Year &amp; her friends. Her sister died when she was eight, and last night I watched as she lost hope and it nearly killed me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darkroutes That sounds lovely. But can you take the complex and relocate it to California?  We’re nice. 🤣❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xMoonOfNeptune @AdamParkhomenko This might sound cray, but my girlfriend is psychic (swear!) I asked her about the election yesterday morning. She said, “It’s going to be fine, but it’s going to take days to get the results and it’s going to be chaotic.”   I’m praying the “It’s going to be fine” is accurate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darkroutes Are you SURE you want to move to Florida?  My husband was raised in Miami Beach so we go and visit family and get the ‘eff out of there ASAP!  The Jews hate The Cubans, the Cubans hate the Blacks &amp; Racist Caucasians hate anyone other.  It’s sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xMoonOfNeptune @AdamParkhomenko If we do get rid of him. I’m praying and bargaining with God like never before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xMoonOfNeptune @AdamParkhomenko Dems lost seats in The House picked up QAnon CAF members, #ModcowMitch won, Putin won.  Even if Biden wins Mitch will block everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darkroutes Good idea! Therapeutic too! Now I have something to do today,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darkroutes Not good.  I realized America is a lie. We’re not the “Land of Liberty” we’re a racist, hateful nation that is controlled by radical pundits  Even if Biden wins Dems lost seats in Congress. Nothing will get done.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AdamParkhomenko It was going to be champagne. I didn’t drink. I took a Xanax.  America the land of liberty never existed, it never will.  Hate and racism won.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandyRainbow What I’m thinking is this - Last night I realized that the America I thought we were was all a lie.   This sucks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I woke up this morning and for a brief moment I didn’t recall last night.  Then I remembered. The country I though we were is dead.  I’m disgusted.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheRickWilson @suemarietta AYFKM?   #bullshitBannon is back?   Of course he is, he loves the smell of evil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MojackMarine @igneousidol The good guys need a win!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonanKelly13 @KarenSalitis I am crying every single day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewYang @nevermore_007 We care about you too!   The mask makes you look debonair and even smarter!  #math<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@K_JeanPierre @wtime90 Fantastic idea!   #ObamaCommencement2020   It’s exactly what America needs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rphalange206 I know.   I have never seen news anchors have nothing to say after watching a #TrumpPressConf due time absolute shock.   I’m disgusted.   #WhereAreTheTests  Trump 2/20 - “We will have beautiful tests” Trump 4/20- “The States have to handle testing.”  https://t.co/fA7riqsxVl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rxjef77 “We will be working on that” “We are working on that” “We will look into that” “We will be discussing that”  #Trump &amp; his🐮💩 is killing Americans.  #GOPGenocide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RockPaper_Sista That’s exactly what I thought.   Ivanka once told a reporter he died it himself and when it was bright yellow she knew he didn’t wait long enough for it to process.   God I really hate him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSusanCollins Did you watch the 🦇💩 crazy authoritarian #TrumpPressConf?  We know you did &amp; yet you say absolutely nothing.  Your guy, the one you swore “Had learning his lesson” is spreading our #Constitution during a #pandemic  Have you EVER seen or heard him express #empathy? Rhetorical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I tweeted this yesterday -  Guess what #Trump said again?<|endoftext|>
