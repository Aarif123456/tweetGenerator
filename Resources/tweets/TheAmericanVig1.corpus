<|startoftext|>@ClodaghSnarks Black deaths in our country, a fraction of a percentage was unarmed blacks being shot by cops, which doesn't always mean "not dangerous" as we seen with Michael Brown. Double the amount of unarmed whites were shot. A couple of rich cunts kneeling is pathetic at best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClodaghSnarks An "idea" doesn't burn down buildings and beat you with a baseball bat. If you truly believe they don't exist, then no point debating, you are truly lost. And I feel sorry for you. Left wing radicals burn down cities, attack Innocents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClodaghSnarks Burning down buildings, murder...yeah super peaceful. They were thugs. They will never amount to anything good in this life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClodaghSnarks Trump supporters are beaten to a bloody pulp, many have been murdered, as we seen in the summer riots. Trump supporters are silenced by big tech and smeared by the media. A lot is at stake. You have to be cautious wearing a maga hat but you don't wearing anything pro Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I made this account because I have a small following on my other, and I was afraid to admit I was a Trump supporter. But why should I fear? I will link my other account soon. I shouldn't have to be afraid.   #MAGA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@iamamytoff I always thought he was funny but didn't really board the Trump train until it was just him vs Hilary but damn did he win me over and some!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amyklobuchar Typical leftist, speaking for the rest of us. Not everyone is a leftist like you, get out of your god damn bubble for one second and you'll see. Many of us proudly voted for Trump and one huge plus was his chance at supreme Court picks. So yeah, it is ours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billburr being hit hard for his SNL speech, I personally thought it was hilarious. Both sides need to lighten up, humor will be our saving grace from the cancel culture. I am right wing AF but I always supported the right to mock either side. Don't be so GD sensitive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zach4vikings Not at all, we literally elected him because he isn't rehearsed, scripted, speaks like everyday people pretty much. Say what you will about him but he is real, speaks his mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews is such a disgrace, they have now officially tipped to the left with the exception of Tucker and Greg.  @hodgetwins @scrowder  and many others are the way of the future for conservative news.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LynnWoodcock2 @FoxNews Already have except for Greg and Tucker but that's it. Conservatives need to check out more people like @scrowder @RubinReport @RealCandaceO and many other shows/podcast that are just a million times better than Fox.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USATRUMPMAN1 @BeachCity55 Plenty of doctors including Fauci said they do little to nothing once upon a time BUT if a store requires it, I will wear one. No need to be a dick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Oh we will but not with you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching @RSBNetwork and wow, it is just so beautiful and uplifting seeing all this support for our president from people of all walks of life. Makes me damn proud (more than ever) to be an American.  #Trump #RedWave2020 #MAGA #USA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cases cases cases, hardly any mention on deaths. We don't ask is it a hoax? We ask, is it worth stopping our lives, putting people out of business, driving up suicides, alcoholism drug use, depression...we can't lockdown again.   #COVID #USA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I truly believe, most undecided voters will see how despicable the left is during all this and we will have a massive red wave this election. Keep up the good fight RSBN!  #Trump2020 #RedWave2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer LOL nice try.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ASavageNation Nothing changed. He'll be fine and the death numbers are still dropping. I wear when required in stores because I'm not an asshole but while I go for a run? While I'm alone in a car? No, that's just stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Left: TRUMP IS MEAN AND A BULLY. WE NEED DECENCY BACK IN THE WHITE HOUSE.  Also The Left: TRUMP HAS COVID I HOPE HE AND HIS WIFE DIE SLOWLY HAHA.  #TrumpHasCovid #Trump2020 #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeachCity55 No, don't be like the left. He shouldn't lose his job. He is a hack, yes. And was one of the worst moderators of all time but didn't do anything illegal. Just don't watch Fox news lol. Plenty of other good sources! Like @scrowder or @RSBNetwork<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hrkbenowen Joe rogan! But a more realistic choice, Hugh Hewitt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@h3h3productions Yeah who would want the lowest unemployment rate, crack down on animal cruelty, peace in the middle east, criminal reform, building a wall.  But TRUMP HAS MEAN TWEETS. You used to be my favorite. SAD.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samanthamarika1 Wrong. It's Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SnowDayJustice @KyleKashuv Lol Trump had enough ammo to last a life time. Biden was a fucking embarrassment at best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BretBaier Trump. 100%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump won. Everything out of his mouth was 100% true.   #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump. Never. Said. The. KKK. Are. Very. Fine. People.  #Debates2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Trump is on FIRE. Holy crap y'all.  #Trump #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ASavageNation He did nothing illegal so who cares? Doesn't change his middle east peace deal, his criminal reform, crack down on animal cruelty, support for our cops and vets. His policies are rock solid, he'll be fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizWillis_  https://t.co/ae19vTwV09<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guys! It's easy following check mark accounts and I love them! But looking for more average Joe Trump supporters to follow, who is out there?!  #Trump #Conservatives #Trump2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samanthamarika1 Hell fckin yeah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My fellow conservatives, don't make masks a thing. If a store asks you to wear one, just do it for fuck sake. If they demand 24/7 then yes, fight back, but it's a business, you don't have to like the rules but you should follow. It's their biz not yours. don't be fucking cringe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYGovCuomo Its not though, you idiot lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First of all, how bout you start with yourself or maybe Al Sharpton?! Nothing Trump did was illegal but you wouldn't know that because you're a god damn idiot. PLUS Trump gives his president salary away. Something tells me you nor Joe Biden would be as charitable. #Trump2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SanderVerboog @realDonaldTrump Yeah that's the Democrats, BLM, ANTIFA etc. They literally have already have done it. They don't get their way, they burn half the city down. Fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So this is yet another lie they are sticking to? Just how they lied about Trump saying the KKK were very nice people. It's all 100% a lie and has been proven but yet they stick to it...the left are despicable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer We know, good. Because it certainly is not affordable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know a lot of people HATE the masks, I personally do to BUT as a small family business, don't give them a hard time if they require a mask, you're not giving up any liberties or anything like that. Few mins under the stores rules and you're done, not so bad. Don't be an asshole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealCandaceO They'll attack and already started with her stance on abortion. "SHE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT WOMEN'S HEALTH."<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Stop saying "cancel culture" "political correctness" etc. It's The Left.  BLM, ANTIFA = The Left. Need to be exact here.  #BLM #CancelCulture<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> https://t.co/ApqpHnVjSW  Great summary of the disgusting/criminal pedo flick called Cuties. I seen lots of comments about it but no one that's actually seen it, until now. It's confirmed...it's worse than you thought apparently.   #canclenetflix #Netflix #YouTube<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just finished Riding the Dragon documentary from @theblaze it was very good and explained a lot about the Bidens I didn't know. I highly recommend it!  https://t.co/JOqcNdIz08  #HunterBiden #CORRUPTION #MAGA2020 #RedWave2020 #Biden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamcarolla I can't believe she actually flat out said it...but that's only if Biden wins. If it's Trump, coronavirus will see it's highest numbers ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealBrysonGray Yessir, me and my whole family!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you @scrowder for helping me look hella fresh in that sweet merch of yours!  #LouderwithCrowder #Conservative #YouTube  https://t.co/XLMiVDoYdP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods Well, good to know I'm human.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimRunsHisMouth Especially not 15 cell phones, I've literally just factory reset mine last week, it's a small effort to just initiate the process. Not like there is a "reset" button on the side of phones. I hope they keep pushing this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For people trying to overshadow/dismiss 9/11 by comparing it to Covid deaths...you are despicable and the worst of this world. That's like your dad being murdered and I say "So what, there are people who lost both parents" show some damn respect. #NeverForget911 #NeverForget #USA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedcruz  https://t.co/iSIkhllJvL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was legitimately annoying me lol. They know Trump did everything he possibly could have and they hate it. They are desperate for some ammunition, especially after Pelosi's blow-out incident.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stillgray A few moments later...  https://t.co/7qh3VlbAQO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrdeplorable @4annegs @RSBNetwork That is awesome to hear, good for you! They definitely need/deserve all the support they can get. Just discovered them a few rallies ago, they are great!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching the #MAGA Rally through @RSBNetwork on YouTube! I highly recommend them, they show rallies, speeches etc. Without interruption AND have some great hosts!  #TrumpRallyMichigan #Trump2020 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #RedWave2020 #Conservatives  https://t.co/800kV1qTPT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @MittRomney Mitt is a fraud, he needs to switch parties.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cernovich It's okay Netflix said they changed the cover art(sarcasm)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr The media are the scum of the earth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump didn't want people to panic, that's what a leader does. He stopped travel to China, which even the eXpErTs said SAVED thousands of lives if not millions. PELOSI and other Democrats downplayed it, said it was no big deal and Trump was xenophobic for travel ban. #MAGA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Political correctness … is a euphemism for ‘that which offends the left."  - Dennis Prager  #Conservative #freespeech #DennisPrager<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benshapiro The Democrats have been more flip floppy on COVID than any other issue in history. Makes my head spin listening to them speak about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boom.  #MAGA #COVID19 #RedWave2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This country is in a civil war, we need fighters (not physically for the dummies that take it literally) like Trump! Which is why I proudly support him. American Vigilante was a VERY last minute costume idea I had back in 18' so I revived it for a fun idea. #MAGA #Conservatives  https://t.co/brXpZO2773<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scrowder They(especially Nancy) are trying so hard to steer away from Nancy's Salon incident and the fact that almost every single democratic leader said this virus was no big deal and called Trump racist for stopping travel from China. They downplayed it, not him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samanthamarika1 YES.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beautiful.  #RedWave2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RubinReport Tecmo Bowl! Fantastic game! Also just got Bulls V. Blazers for my SEGA Genesis, love it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sidneycade2 @hodgetwins Someone obviously didn't have a Snickers today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBabylonBee First they bring back Colin Kaepernick and now this?! Absolutely buying this now. Let's freaking go!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@philipttirino @realDonaldTrump Good for you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great #MAGA Rally tonight. So much energy and good vibes. Biden has no where even near this level of enthusiasm for his campaign. He's in trouble and the left knows it, hence the major flip flopping lately.  #RedWave2020 #Trump2020 @realDonaldTrump #Conservative<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOL got em<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@catturd2 Yeppers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scrowder Lol...oh boy. Poor Joe. I can not wait for those debates...if they happen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scrowder #metoo was finished and showed their political bias the second they ignored Tara Reade.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TPUSA Absolutely disgusting. SMH.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I finally came out that I'm a Trump Supporter to my family.. not great but damn, it was liberating. My bff didn't understand but hopefully he comes around .  #USA #DonaldTrump #POTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Such an amazing film, I watched it twice and ready for a third!  #UncleTomFilm #Documentary #Conservative<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>They don't care, they are filthy rich and set for the rest of their life. Sports was one of the VERY few places to escape politics but unfortunately, The Left destroyed that as well, like everything they touch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How come you didn't the 8 years with Obama? Or the overall 47 years you been in government? Because you are a typical politician. You won't do jack shit. Change my mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drewbrees So what is it that you respect most from Jacob Blake? Was it the third degree sexual assault charges? Maybe him fighting with cops beforehand? You are a pathetic human being Drew. Protect and praise evil...shame on you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God Damn Retards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really? Most Small businesses may never reopen ever again because of the Democratic/China lockdown. My dad has worked 7 days a week all his life and can hardly make it now thanks to YOUR lockdown.<|endoftext|>
