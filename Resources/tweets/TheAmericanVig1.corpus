<|startoftext|>@ClodaghSnarks Black deaths in our country, a fraction of a percentage was unarmed blacks being shot by cops, which doesn't always mean "not dangerous" as we seen with Michael Brown. Double the amount of unarmed whites were shot. A couple of rich cunts kneeling is pathetic at best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClodaghSnarks An "idea" doesn't burn down buildings and beat you with a baseball bat. If you truly believe they don't exist, then no point debating, you are truly lost. And I feel sorry for you. Left wing radicals burn down cities, attack Innocents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClodaghSnarks Burning down buildings, murder...yeah super peaceful. They were thugs. They will never amount to anything good in this life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClodaghSnarks Trump supporters are beaten to a bloody pulp, many have been murdered, as we seen in the summer riots. Trump supporters are silenced by big tech and smeared by the media. A lot is at stake. You have to be cautious wearing a maga hat but you don't wearing anything pro Biden.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@amyklobuchar Typical leftist, speaking for the rest of us. Not everyone is a leftist like you, get out of your god damn bubble for one second and you'll see. Many of us proudly voted for Trump and one huge plus was his chance at supreme Court picks. So yeah, it is ours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billburr being hit hard for his SNL speech, I personally thought it was hilarious. Both sides need to lighten up, humor will be our saving grace from the cancel culture. I am right wing AF but I always supported the right to mock either side. Don't be so GD sensitive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zach4vikings Not at all, we literally elected him because he isn't rehearsed, scripted, speaks like everyday people pretty much. Say what you will about him but he is real, speaks his mind.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ASavageNation Nothing changed. He'll be fine and the death numbers are still dropping. I wear when required in stores because I'm not an asshole but while I go for a run? While I'm alone in a car? No, that's just stupid.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@samanthamarika1 Hell fckin yeah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My fellow conservatives, don't make masks a thing. If a store asks you to wear one, just do it for fuck sake. If they demand 24/7 then yes, fight back, but it's a business, you don't have to like the rules but you should follow. It's their biz not yours. don't be fucking cringe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYGovCuomo Its not though, you idiot lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First of all, how bout you start with yourself or maybe Al Sharpton?! Nothing Trump did was illegal but you wouldn't know that because you're a god damn idiot. PLUS Trump gives his president salary away. Something tells me you nor Joe Biden would be as charitable. #Trump2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SanderVerboog @realDonaldTrump Yeah that's the Democrats, BLM, ANTIFA etc. They literally have already have done it. They don't get their way, they burn half the city down. Fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So this is yet another lie they are sticking to? Just how they lied about Trump saying the KKK were very nice people. It's all 100% a lie and has been proven but yet they stick to it...the left are despicable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer We know, good. Because it certainly is not affordable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know a lot of people HATE the masks, I personally do to BUT as a small family business, don't give them a hard time if they require a mask, you're not giving up any liberties or anything like that. Few mins under the stores rules and you're done, not so bad. Don't be an asshole<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods He repeats everything 3-4 times and I still can't understand this GD idiot. Democratic cities ladies and gentlemen. Vote republican.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizWillis_ So glad I've discovered your channel. You guys are awesome, keep it up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks to the race baiting, cop hating Democrats. Give me reasons every single day to vote republican all down the board.  #redwave #MAGA #BlueLivesMatter #BackTheBlue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennajameson Maybe he pulled a Mueller and "accidentally" deleted them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeachCity55 As we seen in 2016, the polls mean nothing. I've never, nor known anyone that has taken any poll. CNN even said their results were about 1200 in a certain age group. It is so limited.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>USA flag represents all that is GOOD about our great country. Our anthem is for ALL Americans, we take a few mins to show respect to ALL who made this country great, who died for it, who still fight today. We have improved from our mistakes and have come a long way. #USA #NFL  https://t.co/WmIZ5DnpG5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TX_Bruce @realDonaldTrump Yessir, for the second time now and my entire family is joining me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@honor_dennis @BeachCity55 @OANN @RSBNetwork is the best by far anyways!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Fantastic #MAGA Rally! So much enthusiasm and patriotism and Trump was on üî•üî•üî•. Make America Great Again!.  #MAGA2020 #Trump2020 #RedWave2020 #Conservatives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Truthseeker126 @JoeBiden Red wave incoming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSBNetwork  https://t.co/FYuZoVpPkM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarbieWoodside @4annegs RSBN on YouTube is by far the best coverage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ready for the #MAGA rally tonight. Thank you @RSBNetwork for the amazing coverage!  #Trump2020 #MAGA2020 #RedWave2020 #Conservative #Conservatives #USA  https://t.co/QXK6hdSxmF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Muller's team really did "accidentally" wipe their phones(which I don't believe) should they have the jobs they got now? You have to be almost brain dead to not realize you're about to wipe your phone, it even asked you "are your sure?" Either liars or stupid AF. #MuellerGate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealEricCarmen I was about to say! Getting ready for the MAGA rally! Got both TVs onüòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoguePrincess7 @Yoder_Esqq I'm actually very anti cancel culture on both sides, I have almost no limit when it comes to jokes and edgy humor etc. But when it involves minors like this...that's criminal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeySaladsReal 11!!!  https://t.co/59KAq6H01m<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So excited for the #MAGA Rally tonight!  #MAGA2020 #Trump #Conservatives #RedWave2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvanAKilgore @realDonaldTrump YES.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@samanthamarika1 "Give me liberty, or give me death!‚Äù<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/ApqpHnVjSW  Great summary of the disgusting/criminal pedo flick called Cuties. I seen lots of comments about it but no one that's actually seen it, until now. It's confirmed...it's worse than you thought apparently.   #canclenetflix #Netflix #YouTube<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just finished Riding the Dragon documentary from @theblaze it was very good and explained a lot about the Bidens I didn't know. I highly recommend it!  https://t.co/JOqcNdIz08  #HunterBiden #CORRUPTION #MAGA2020 #RedWave2020 #Biden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamcarolla I can't believe she actually flat out said it...but that's only if Biden wins. If it's Trump, coronavirus will see it's highest numbers ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealBrysonGray Yessir, me and my whole family!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you @scrowder for helping me look hella fresh in that sweet merch of yours!  #LouderwithCrowder #Conservative #YouTube  https://t.co/XLMiVDoYdP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods Well, good to know I'm human.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimRunsHisMouth Especially not 15 cell phones, I've literally just factory reset mine last week, it's a small effort to just initiate the process. Not like there is a "reset" button on the side of phones. I hope they keep pushing this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For people trying to overshadow/dismiss 9/11 by comparing it to Covid deaths...you are despicable and the worst of this world. That's like your dad being murdered and I say "So what, there are people who lost both parents" show some damn respect. #NeverForget911 #NeverForget #USA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedcruz  https://t.co/iSIkhllJvL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was legitimately annoying me lol. They know Trump did everything he possibly could have and they hate it. They are desperate for some ammunition, especially after Pelosi's blow-out incident.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stillgray A few moments later...  https://t.co/7qh3VlbAQO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrdeplorable @4annegs @RSBNetwork That is awesome to hear, good for you! They definitely need/deserve all the support they can get. Just discovered them a few rallies ago, they are great!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching the #MAGA Rally through @RSBNetwork on YouTube! I highly recommend them, they show rallies, speeches etc. Without interruption AND have some great hosts!  #TrumpRallyMichigan #Trump2020 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #RedWave2020 #Conservatives  https://t.co/800kV1qTPT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @MittRomney Mitt is a fraud, he needs to switch parties.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cernovich It's okay Netflix said they changed the cover art(sarcasm)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr The media are the scum of the earth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump didn't want people to panic, that's what a leader does. He stopped travel to China, which even the eXpErTs said SAVED thousands of lives if not millions. PELOSI and other Democrats downplayed it, said it was no big deal and Trump was xenophobic for travel ban. #MAGA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Political correctness ‚Ä¶ is a euphemism for ‚Äòthat which offends the left."  - Dennis Prager  #Conservative #freespeech #DennisPrager<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benshapiro The Democrats have been more flip floppy on COVID than any other issue in history. Makes my head spin listening to them speak about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boom.  #MAGA #COVID19 #RedWave2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This country is in a civil war, we need fighters (not physically for the dummies that take it literally) like Trump! Which is why I proudly support him. American Vigilante was a VERY last minute costume idea I had back in 18' so I revived it for a fun idea. #MAGA #Conservatives  https://t.co/brXpZO2773<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scrowder They(especially Nancy) are trying so hard to steer away from Nancy's Salon incident and the fact that almost every single democratic leader said this virus was no big deal and called Trump racist for stopping travel from China. They downplayed it, not him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samanthamarika1 YES.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beautiful.  #RedWave2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RubinReport Tecmo Bowl! Fantastic game! Also just got Bulls V. Blazers for my SEGA Genesis, love it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sidneycade2 @hodgetwins Someone obviously didn't have a Snickers today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBabylonBee First they bring back Colin Kaepernick and now this?! Absolutely buying this now. Let's freaking go!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@philipttirino @realDonaldTrump Good for you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great #MAGA Rally tonight. So much energy and good vibes. Biden has no where even near this level of enthusiasm for his campaign. He's in trouble and the left knows it, hence the major flip flopping lately.  #RedWave2020 #Trump2020 @realDonaldTrump #Conservative<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOL got em<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@catturd2 Yeppers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scrowder Lol...oh boy. Poor Joe. I can not wait for those debates...if they happen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scrowder #metoo was finished and showed their political bias the second they ignored Tara Reade.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TPUSA Absolutely disgusting. SMH.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I finally came out that I'm a Trump Supporter to my family.. not great but damn, it was liberating. My bff didn't understand but hopefully he comes around .  #USA #DonaldTrump #POTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Such an amazing film, I watched it twice and ready for a third!  #UncleTomFilm #Documentary #Conservative<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>They don't care, they are filthy rich and set for the rest of their life. Sports was one of the VERY few places to escape politics but unfortunately, The Left destroyed that as well, like everything they touch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How come you didn't the 8 years with Obama? Or the overall 47 years you been in government? Because you are a typical politician. You won't do jack shit. Change my mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drewbrees So what is it that you respect most from Jacob Blake? Was it the third degree sexual assault charges? Maybe him fighting with cops beforehand? You are a pathetic human being Drew. Protect and praise evil...shame on you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God Damn Retards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really? Most Small businesses may never reopen ever again because of the Democratic/China lockdown. My dad has worked 7 days a week all his life and can hardly make it now thanks to YOUR lockdown.<|endoftext|>
