<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Thanks 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan I've read the Bhagavad-Gita and it was a real eye opener for me 😇  Looking forward to read the other books you've mentioned. Are they easily available in English ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Totally agree. The Roman Catholic Church is a great example of an old dominant business. Most of their income comes from education, healthcare etc. other than the religious income  I would like to point out that the other denominations are not so organized although they aim to be<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnyBodyCanFly Sir by selling do you mean selling stocks or sales ?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IamLoneWolf_17 @FundaTrader @RetracementT Chahte to hum bhi hai 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RetracementT @FundaTrader Ha kiya to hai but don't remember if I could do it or not 🤔😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FundaTrader @RetracementT Sir differentiation to ho jaata hai aur MCQ format ho to integration ke questions ke options ko differentiate kar sakte hai.  Personally, I would say that Balance Sheet is still tougher ! 😁<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FitFounder A superhero 🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrantCardone Don't know about them but I definitely will 😇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aditya_kondawar I think for me the best in 2020 is yet to happen ! Only 22 days to go and I have a lot planned out. It's gonna make this year memorable for me.   Other than that, my portfolio did very well (actually more than expected) for my first year 😇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShyamanujSaikia Bhai Bhai 🤗😂🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@money_theory 50k daily ? That's amazing !!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@InvestmentBook1 Oh..thanks 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvestmentBook1 @Vivek_Investor @ms89_meet @dmuthuk @RichifyMeClub Is this from security analysis by Benjamin Graham ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvestmentBook1 The Success Principles by @JackCanfield   I've read it 4 times. It's like a ritual for me to read it at the beginning of every year and refresh my subconscious with the principles. 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People supporting the Farm Bill protests on Social Media are the same ones who ask the "sabziwala" to give "dhaniya" for free !! 🤦🏻‍♂️  #FarmLaws2020 #FarmBills2020 #FarmBill<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShyamanujSaikia Absolutely right 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@money_theory Haha ....true   Most of the time it's a "One Day Wonder"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelJ191272 Quite possibly true 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AgarwalBinayak @VJ_Rabindranath - Stop looking at the price daily if you've invested for the long term  - Handover control of your account to a very close one of yours and give them instructions depending on what you want to do (This is not advisable. It's better to learn to control your emotions yourself)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QUANTJESUS People will lose money occasionally even if they take it seriously. Even professionals do.   But I've a problem with people who wanna do it for the "thrill" of doing it. That's not trading, that's gambling !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan My father's employees live in a village nearby and they occasionally used to bring wild honey for us with the wax 😋 It's like tasting heaven 😇 Never bought honey from the stores after that !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"If you want to trade for fun, don't !

<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan The ability to have and having independent thoughts, principles, philosophies and biases will make anyone stand out of the crowd of parrots who only talk what others are talking and can't think for themselves !!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Sorry 😂  https://t.co/myYhD1F1SY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jitendrajain Ok Sir...sure 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jitendrajain Sir how to select the strike price for this strategy ?   And what is the logic for reducing OI ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChoubeySahab Both positively and negatively<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvestmentBook1 Sahi baat hai. I was fully invested before March. Couldn't do anything, just had to wait 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HBKodali 😯🤐😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HBKodali Let the ACB do it 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelJ191272 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iAmKyleCee @FitFounder It's the best<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Many times they tag their own handles in the list !! 😂🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamLoneWolf_17 Haha...nice 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShyamanujSaikia @anand_luhar 😁👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Best way to get rid of coffee is to gradually reduce the sugar in it until no sugar at all.   Most people are addicted to the sugar we add to coffee/tea. Sugar is what gives that hit in the morning. Caffeine takes time to refresh you.   Try this...you might stop drinking coffee !<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Sunil130 @Rishikesh_ADX I don't want to target anyone personally but agar koi galat data leke kisi ko faaltu mein troll karta hai then that's stupid !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rishikesh_ADX Don't know how he's calculating but from 1 Dec, 2008 to 1 Dec, 2020, CAGR of Nifty is 13.85% !!  Bas faltu ka negativity aur trolling karwalo !!  https://t.co/0tjWS3PXzt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChoubeySahab Agreed × 100 !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvestmentBook1 Mine : 😂  Plus I'm the @_the_smiley_guy 😎  I'm infamous for using too much smileys 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvestmentBook1 I usually watch business news only for fun 😂  It's funny to see how stupid they can be !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvestmentBook1 This is true actually 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderDivergent The best investors not only know how to make the most money (high return strategy) but they do that on a lot of money (highly scalable strategy).  Keeping these two things in mind, I would say Warren Buffett is the best investor IMO.   #WarrenBuffett #BerkshireHathaway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is it. This is all you need to become a great intraday trader.  It's so simple that people actually don't follow this and complicate the process.  Keep it simple and be consistent !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kiran03071145 Accounting creativity is a real problem when analyzing earnings. That's why cashflow is the safest metric to follow !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RJGyanchandani Thankyou Sir 😇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RJGyanchandani Agreed.   Most people don't even realize that they need to research a stock deeply before buying.  It took me 25 days to go through the annual reports, quarterly results, concalls etc. of the past 10 years before buying my first stock  Professional investors take even more time !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember, every pro once started as a rookie.   It's just that the pro didn't give up and kept learning and improving his/her skills !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very few people can successfully dichotomise trading and investing activities  Rakesh Jhunjhunwala ji is one example  Most successful people in this industry specialize in either of the two  If you are a beginner focus on only one thing and master it first !  #trading #investing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvestmentBook1 Exactly. They will never stop it !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ A very hearty congratulations Sir 😊🎉  You were the reason why I joined Twitter and found so many great people like you who were giving a lot of invaluable knowledge for free 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kirtan0810 People are always looking for turnaround stories.   The media should warn people about this (I don't know if they are )!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SJosephBurns I can recommend the ones the changed mine 👇 Rich Dad Poor Dad and Cashflow Quadrant !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ In the words of Viru Sahastra Budhe of ICE, "Life begins with murder" 😁  On a serious note, always consider yourself lucky for having a life. Don't misuse it, don't abuse it and make full use of it 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamLoneWolf_17 @ProdigalTrader Tradingview has stopped giving custom intervals/TF for free now.  If you want to see 75m charts for free, you can check out  https://t.co/UKsPRdq2IN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you are like me and you bookmark your favourite tweets a lot, then spend some time every weekend to go through those tweets and let those thoughts sink into your subconscious 😇  Mention the top 2 handles in your bookmarks section !  Mine are @theBuoyantMan and @AnyBodyCanFly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Woww...never thought about this 😊   That's why we say "Laser sharp focus" ⚡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamLoneWolf_17 @ProdigalTrader Really sorry.  "/" is the shortcut for opening the indicator window  For changing the TF, press "," key or just press any number.   Eg: if you want to change to 75m TF, press "," and type "75". It's minutes by default. If you type "75m" it'll change to 75 months !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamLoneWolf_17 @ProdigalTrader Sure Sir 😊<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@vineetpatawari @BWBusinessworld @vivbajaj @vinaypagaria @elearnmarkets @mystockedge Congratulations Sir 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adi2five 52 generations !!  The hotel and the family must be having a lot of stories to pass on 😇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan 😂 Seen those horrible tweets a lot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Never had that fear. I'm on the other side of the fear scale.   Fear of execution !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvestmentBook1 Love how you quote books on various topics. This gives me a reason to buy those books if the content interests me 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Moving average of supertrend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QUANTJESUS And that is the best part of Twitter 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Prashanth_Krish How does BH share's underperformance justify Buffett's strategy "not scalable" ?   Correct me if I'm wrong, but value is not equal to price.   And Berkshire is not a PMS, that it's portfolio's performance is equivalent to it's shares performance.  https://t.co/ahkO6yF2wN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stepbystep888 That happens with me a lot. I just keep jotting down those additional topics on a list and postpone it for later.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShyamanujSaikia 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@money_theory Donations will reduce my taxable income so I'll donate some amount.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KAnantrao I agree 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvestmentBook1 Don't mention it Bhai 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pardon the autocorrect 😁  *Reading financial statements<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a great thread. Must read for people who are beginners into trading financial statements.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not true in my case 😅  I love my curriculum books 😇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apply these tips the next time you pick up a book !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShyamanujSaikia Yeah...I'm also waiting for confirmation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShyamanujSaikia Aaj market khel gaya sabke emotions ke saath 😁  Kya lagta hai Bhai ? Mujhe to ye topping out lag raha hai !! 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't make the mistake of quitting your job for an unstable income source.  Build that source to a reasonable one so that you don't need your job to pay your bills.  Then quit your job.  Trading/doing business with a goal to make regular income for survival is financial suicide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan I actually have that downloaded already 😊 and planning to read all his books.  Thanks.   I keep asking everyone about their valuation methods since no one talks about it upfront 😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Sir do you have a valuation method for value investing ?   If you aren't comfortable telling it, can you just name the method like DCF etc. which best matches yours ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Harsh55511 Yeah... that's actually the best way to do it IMO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderDivergent @TradingComposur Agreed.  Going all in is a very emotionally draining venture.  Even if you have your risk managed, you are giving up a steady equity curve in the expectation of a big return !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderHarneet Sure Sir...it's very much possible that that 1 person or more really need the help.  Hope all those people who receive such blessings realize it's value and don't misuse it 😇🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan This video by Ray Dalio is great to understand why to diversify and how much to diversify. Simply put, diversification only works when we invest into less correlated assets(ideally 0) and not over diversify.   https://t.co/IGs5wFlLtU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderHarneet It shows your generous heart by this effort Sir 😇  But those people don't deserve it. Most of them sell their blankets to buy liquor and drugs as they get blankets and warm clothes from many people like us.  I'm speaking from experience. Instead we can/should donate elsewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vineetpatawari Sir if you don't mind...which method of valuation do you follow ?   Is it a good idea to value a company bu multiple methods like DCF, PE etc. and determine the intrinsic value based on an average of the valuations ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's quite possible. Infact, I see a lot of people already doing this.   If you're planning for the long term don't regret having wasted a year. Pls don't go overboard with your spending 🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeeyushTrader Rather than giving all the undue importance to gold, we should only have about 10-15% of the portfolio in gold as a stabilizer.A bigger portion should go towards equity depending on your risk appetite.This is what the best investors including Ray Dalio have been doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neil_agrawal @dmuthuk With all due respect,I would like to politely disagree to the idea of money saved is money earned  Money earned -money spent =Money saved   If someone has to save every penny to buy a share,then he doesn't have enough income. Rather he should try to increase income to invest more<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Do you recommend backtesting with VWAP ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congratulations @theBuoyantMan as you reach #10k followers on Twitter.  Personally, his handle has influenced me the most on Twitter with his exhaustive threads on finance, entreprenuership, coding etc. and his quick DM replies.  Thankyou for everything Shravan Sir 😇🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan @PriceActionPA Agreed. In that case, there's a higher chance of emotions taking control and a consequent blowup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PriceActionPA @theBuoyantMan I don't think that's necessary. If someone is good at RM and managed to protect 2L, why is it necessary to blowup a bigger capital ?  Or is it @theBuoyantMan ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ManishY109 @gracious_pc Yes...very true Bhai 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adi2five First Income - 50 😅 Age - 8 🤘 Sold 5 handmade "Butterflies" for home decoration !<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes. We wait for them with our hearts, souls and cash ! 😇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShyamanujSaikia @anand_luhar 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pakuuuman @Abhishekkar_ Understood...sectoral ETFs also 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pakuuuman @Abhishekkar_ Index ETFs Sir ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adi2five None. They don't fall in my investment criteria. I prefer to invest in "not so popular" companies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShyamanujSaikia Those experiences are worse than hitting multiple SLs in a day 😂  Happy Men's Day ! 💪<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Nice 😂  Even I hate elaichi in payasam !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Best analogy for option selling ever 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvestmentBook1 Congrats 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gracious_pc That's true...its not needed but schools will do it.  I was being taught how to turn on, shutdown the computer etc. when I used to play GTA 🤦‍♂️  The basics of today will be taught in  schools in the future ! 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvestmentBook1 Ohh ... 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvestmentBook1 That's true... financial illiteracy is a real problem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvestmentBook1 Didn't get it Bhai ! 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvestmentBook1 I know but why would you even want to face such a situation ?   Why not deposit the money in a bank with good financials and have peace of mind, instead of depending on the government to save our back ?  After all it's our money !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Atleast after today's moratorium on Lakshmi Vilas Bank, you should realize that banks are not so "safe" as you think.  This is why it's important to read the balance sheets of banks even when you deposit money.  You're giving money for heaven's sake !  #LVB #banks #money #FD #RBI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rpatil09 @deepakvenkatesh @passivefool How will you define "down" Sir ?   And by the time you wait for the market to go down, you could miss out on a lot of returns.  Plus periodic sip with small capital will be less emotionally draining.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvestmentBook1 This is a great book.   Read it when I was going through a bad phase in life and my troubles looked tiny infront of the author's.   It's a must read !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@avsbangalore Thank you Sir.   Hope more people become aware about this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sourabhsiso19 Exactly.  Would love to see your videos. I'm sure they are gonna be great 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sourabhsiso19 That's good enough Sir. Atleast you'll reach newer people other than your Twitter followers.  On TG most of your subscribers will be from Twitter itself. It doesn't make sense IMO as you can teach the same things, in the same way and market your product on Twitter itself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ @Rule1_Investing Thanks to you Sir 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sourabhsiso19 Sir, if you really want to go the teaching path, YouTube would be your best option.   You'll get more reach and would be able to teach better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Audio is great 👍   One suggestion if I may... pls adjust your camera to your front and at eye level. That would be more comfortable for you and would connect more with the viewers.   For reference do checkout @Rule1_Investing's podcast videos on YouTube.  😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChoubeySahab 10 pm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The day is not far when children will be taught "How to chat online" in schools.  The topics will be  - Chat etiquettes - Smiley meanings - Formal/Informal Chats - How to use GIFs etc. - How to block, mute, protect privacy etc.  😁  #chat #whatsapp #Instagram #dm #chatting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kirtan0810 Most Indians are too risk averse. That's why people prefer to not invest anywhere and find Bank FDs as the only other option. But what about inflation risk ? Have you considered it ?  Read this thread if you want to get some perspective about it.   https://t.co/hIkHgDEa58<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderHarneet Great...Thankyou Sir.   Would love to see more tweets from you regarding crypto from an Indian trader's perspective  😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Sure.. I'll read more about it. Thanks 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderHarneet Sir does wazirx have good liquidity for intraday trading ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kirubaakaran Kerala cops are pretty strict there and people also naturally abide by the law. Plus Kerala was the epicenter of Corona (not sure if it still is) so people have taken it seriously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Recently, SC removed the ban by RBI on crypto.   I'm not sure if we can still trade on foreign crypto exchanges but Indian exchanges also rank low in terms of liquidity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Sir what's your view on crypto trading ? Should we try it ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RohitKanojia_ @TraderHarneet Reasons to avoid FnO in the beginning:  -Difficult to comprehend the behaviour of these instruments  -Difficult to manage risk, position size etc. with small capital  -"Overnight leveraged positions" will affect your sleep/emotions and further ruin your trading decisions  😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WritingToRiches @Delahuntagram @aarongrt Oh..thanks for being honest 😇  Yeah it was fun. Earlier I thought it must be a typo ! 😁<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Should we look into the Memorandum of Association, AoA etc. to better understand the management, dividend policies etc. before investing into a company ?   Is it worth the time and effort ?  Do professional analysts/investors do this ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I am a better investor because I am a businessman, and a better businessman because I am an investor."  - Warren Buffett  Think about this !  When investing you're buying a business and if you understand business, you'll become a good investor.  #buffett #investing #business<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvestmentBook1 Wealth was 16% 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since there are only 19 votes, it's better not to conclude this as the "public opinion" but looks like my followers have equally prioritized Health and Peace of Mind 😇  For me peace of mind is the most important but for that I would need health, wealth, relations etc. 😁😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvestmentBook1 It's better to just stay away from crypto until there is clarity. UK recently banned crypto derivatives. People like Dalio and Buffett have still not bought into the crypto story. Due to its high volatility it's good for a short term trade but not as a long term wealth builder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvestmentBook1 @TraderHarneet The RBI ban has been lifted by SC.   https://t.co/hKz8Nd9uaj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chopsyturvey @rajmofficial I would hate to see the leaders of my country living like this. Instead just focus on decreasing corruption. That'd be more than enough. Why change their lifestyle like this ? And public transport for politicians is dangerous for them and the people travelling with them !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Got it. Thankyou Sir.  Yes...people love to hear from people who've done something substantial in life. Will be doing that to have a story for myself 😊<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So when you're learning economics, try to understand microeconomics better. That is what's going to help you more to develop as an investor.  Hope I gave you something new to think about.  Do share this with your friends 😊  Have a good day.  n/n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our focus should be more on specific companies/sectors instead.  Warren Buffett famously stated that macroeconomic forecasts didn't influence his investing decisions.   If one of the world's greatest investors says so, there must be some credit to it.  6/n #buffett<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But you'd be better off if you focus more of your attention on the "micro" picture, as an individual investor.  For retail investors like us, it shouldn't really affect our investments decisions on changes in inflation, GDP etc.  5/n #inflation #GDP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As an investor, you should have a decent understanding of both the fields.   You should be able to interpret how changes in demand/supply will affect an industry/sector, how inflation will affect the currency etc.  4/n #economics #decison<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Macroeconomics looks at a more broader picture and studies countries and governments.  It includes monetory policy, fiscal policy, inflation, GDP etc.  Both these branches are interdependent and complement each other.  3/n #macros #economy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Microeconomics as the name suggests is the study of "individuals" and business decisions.  It looks at how an individual like a consumer, supplier etc. would behave under different conditions, how businesses will be affected by price changes etc.  2/n #economics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Microeconomics Vs Macroeconomics  What's the difference ?  Which one of these should you be more concerned with to make your investment decisions ?  Do they even matter ?  Let's take a look !  1/n #microeconomics #macroeconomics #EconTwitter<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What is long term investing and why should we do it ?  #investing #investor #valueinvesting #fundamentalanalysis    https://t.co/JsJLU8O1rQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope you learned something new 😊  Feel free to ask me if you didn't understand anything.  Do share this people in your circle.  Thanks.  n/n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For people like us who have school, college, jobs etc., long term investing is the best option as we don't have time to spend, infront of the markets  Traders usually have to sit from 9-4 b/w which the markets are open  Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger are notable investors  9/n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whereas, an investor would spend most of his time analyzing what does ABC sell, how much profit does it make, do the customers like its product etc.  Price is the last thing a good investor looks at.  8/n #investor #fintwit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The main difference b/w an investor and a trader is that a trader is more concerned with the "price" of the stock whereas an investor is more concerned with "business" of the stock.  Eg: For a stock ABC, a trader would make a decision based on if the stock is Rs.100, Rs.500 etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ideally a long term investor would like to hold a stock for more than 5-10 years.   During this period he continuously analyzes the business for any new opportunities or threats, to take a decision on whether to hold or sell the stock.  6/n #valueinvesting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Long term investing involves buying an asset and holding it for many years.  The daily price fluctuations are usually ignored by a long term investor  Long term investors usually use fundamental analysis i.e. analyzing the "business" and pay less attention to the price  5/n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The lower you go in this list, the more difficult it becomes for a human to execute.   HFT or High Frequency Trading is carried out by sophisticated computers.  But let's not go there !  Let's focus our attention on long term investing.  4/n #hft #investing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's see what these strategies are:  1)Long term investing - more than a year  2)Positional trading - few weeks to few months  3)Swing Trading - few days to few weeks  4)Intraday Trading - within one day  5)Scalping - within few minutes  6)HFT - within few seconds  3/n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the ways to differentiate these strategies is on the basis of holding period.  Holding period is the time between buying an asset and selling it/squaring off.  Eg: If you buy in 2020 and sell in 2025, your holding period was 5 years.  2/n #holding #period<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Different types of investing strategies based on holding period  Do you know there's no single way to make money from the markets ?

<|startoftext|>What is Demand and Supply ?  The basics 👇  #demand #supply #EconTwitter #economics    https://t.co/WswLErJud7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will be talking more about types of economies on a later day.  For today, hope you learned something new 😊  I would really appreciate your feedbacks and suggestions, if any.  Thanks.  n/n #thread #fintwit #EconTwitter #feedback<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These phenomena are applicable only in free markets like a capitalist economy. In socialist economies, prices are fixed by the government and demand and supply laws don't work.   India is a mixed economy and there are some cases, when these laws don't apply in India  8/n #economy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Similarly, when supply increases, prices drop ⬇️  Bcoz when more and more sellers sell the same thing, buyers will buy from the one who is selling the cheapest and other sellers will start dropping prices to stay in business.  7/n #supply<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When demand increases, prices go up ⬆️ This is bcoz when people want to buy more, they'll start buying for higher prices.  Eg, in a famine or "bhukmari" situation, demand for food is very high. People will be ready to pay very high prices for food.  6/n #famine #demand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Obviously there are exceptions to these laws.  Eg, if the price of diamonds increase, people might buy it more as it becomes more valuable. This is called Veblen Effect.  There's another side to this.  Changes in demand and supply affect prices as well.  5/n #diamond #veblen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Supply is the quantity which a producer produces and according to law of supply, when prices go up, the quantity supplied increases.  Matlab, bhav badega to log (supplier) zyada bechenge.  Supply is also affected by demography, age of consumers etc.  4/n #supply #economy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to the law of demand, the quantity demanded reduces when prices go up, if everything else remains same.  Matlab, bhav bad jaaye to log (consumers) kum khareedenge !  Demand is also affected by income, preferences etc.  3/n #demand #economics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Simply speaking, demand is the quantity what people 1) can and 2) are willing, to buy. Both these conditions must be fulfilled to count as demand.  Eg, A beggar might want a car but he cannot afford it. He has the will but he can't buy. This is not included in demand  2/n #demand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's talk about demand and supply.  You must have heard these words from the mouths of economists, analysts, businessmen etc.  This is one of the most basic concepts you must know in order to understand businesses better and become a better investor.  1/n #demand #supply<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What is capital raising or fundraising ?  #fundraising #capitalism #capital #equity    https://t.co/SZTrN25Eau<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the next time you buy shares of some company without an IPO, and  God forbid the price goes down, don't think that the company has taken your money bcoz it hadn't even got it.  Hope you learned something new   Do share this with your dear ones 😊  n/n #godforbid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Eg: X invests 1L in ABC Ltd. That 1L goes to ABC Ltd and is used by the company for further use. Then, X sells those shares for profit to Y for 1.2L. This money will go to X and the additional 20k will be X's profit. Now, Y can sell the same shares for a profit or loss.  8/n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So if you invest in an IPO, your money goes directly to the company for expansion.   When you buy shares otherwise, you are buying it from someone who just had those shares and your money goes to the seller, not the company !   7/n #expansion #shares<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your company can use this new 1.5cr to expand it's business. This is what fundraising is done for.  Similarly, companies enlist on the exchange to raise capital through equity in the form of shares. This is called an IPO or Initial Public Offer.   6/n #ipo #company<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now both of you decide to raise some money from a Venture Capitalist. Both of you decide to give up 5% each for 1.5cr.  So the total valuation of your company now is 2cr with the following shareholding,  You - 40% Friend - 40% VC - 10%  Note:Your networth just became 3.2x !  5/n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the other hand, equity is less risky but costs more bcoz now you're giving up a portion of your company for the money.  Let's say, you and your friend start a business of Rs.50 L with 50-50 ownership. Your equity in the business is 50%  4/n #startup #Entrepreneur<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Basically there are two ways by which capital is raised : 1. Debt 2. Equity  Debt is when you borrow from a lender like a bank or some other institution. Debt costs are low as compared to equity but is more risky.  3/n #debt #equity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Almost all companies need outside capital to run and expand it's business. Nobody has so much savings to put in and make a business a multi-billion dollar business. Atleast, people like us don't. So when entrepreneurs start a business, they need capital to run it.  2/n #business<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Remember, when measuring economic activity we include either production or income, to avoid double accounting.  This is bcoz in an economy, the production of one entity is the consumption of another and the cost of one is the income of another.  8/n #cost #income<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Net national income or NNI  The “gross” in GDP and GNI indicates that there isno allowance for depreciation (capital consumption) etc.  Net national income is GNI less depreciation.  6/n #gni #nni #gnp<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChoubeySahab That's a great achievement Bhai 😊  I'm also trying to be consistent with my Twitter recently with atleast one thread on finance everyday. Do check it out ! 😇   https://t.co/kamyGO4OEx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChoubeySahab Exactly.   It's probably bcoz of two reasons 1) Sales and marketing is not respected in India, and 2) People consider marketing and branding as bragging/being selfish etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProductFanatic 😁 Nice !!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you are someone who would like to pick stocks on your own, you should learn how to read, interpret and analyze financial statements.  Once you do, you'll know if the company is profitable, has too much debt ?, and many such important info just by reading these statements.  7/n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Financial statements are used by auditors, investors, management, shareholders, government etc. to know about the financial health and performance of the company and to take informed and intelligent decisions, concerning the company.  6/n #intelligent #decisions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cash flow statements show how well the company generates cash and how well it uses it.  It is shown under three heads :  - Cash from Operating Activities ( The company's core business) - Cash from Financial Activities - Cash from Investing Activities  5/n #cashflow #cash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Profit &amp; Loss statement or the P&amp;L statement shows the profitability of the business during the period.

<|startoftext|>@FinsenseG First one. Because I don't think my favourite number would make any difference in a random experiment so I would prefer not to spend an additional 20 Rs. on that 😊<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SumanDhungel15 Thanks a lot brother 😊<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Emmanu_kibet Very true brother 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@7MoJo That's quite possible 🤔  Talking too much about risk will make them too risk averse.  I'll keep that in mind next time Sir 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@otienojulie1 Wise words  Take responsibility for what you can control and accept and adapt to what you can't   😇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@7MoJo Plus I believe that it's more important to make people more risk conscious first before suggesting solutions.  Wouldn't you agree ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@7MoJo Agreed. Maybe none of the active funds haven't. But a simple SIP/Dollar cost averaging into index funds/ETFs would do the job.  Sir, I've not suggested solutions bcoz most of my audience don't even know what inflation or stocks mean.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Case study on Stock Market Crashes in India   https://t.co/JmJginBSub<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those methods are a little complex to comprehend and will be too much for today.  I'll surely be writing about those methods one day.  For now, throw your "Fear of stocks" in the bin and think about investing in them.  Have a Good Day.....cookie ! 😇  n/n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Coming to risk management, do you know there are ways by which you could've protected your portfolio during these crashes.  This is what professional investors do and if you did the same, you wouldn't have actually lost 50% ! You can do this without selling a single stock.  8/n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember, this was a simple "Buy and Forget" strategy without any analysis or risk management.  All you had to believe was that India would survive all problems, which it very well did !!  There was no stock picking and you were only investing in the index.  7/n #problem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The average inflation rate from 1995-2019 was about 7.2% !  This means that we were able to beat inflation with this investment in the past 25 years.  So we can conclude that stocks have historically beaten inflation.  6/n #inflation #beat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even after facing crashes of about 50%, 3 times, your investment would have given a cumulative return of 1212% !!!  And a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of roughly 10% !  We get this return without any kind of cherry picking in 25 years.  5/n #returns<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There were 3 major stock market crashes during this period  - 2000 Dot com bubble crash (-53%) - 2008 Global Financial Crisis (-65%) - 2020 Coronavirus Crash (-40%)  These crashes were horrible but let's assume that you still held on to your investment.  4/n #crash #loss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At the time when I'm tweeting this, the value of Nifty is 12120 as of 6 November, 2020.  So we get almost exactly 25 years as reference.  Let's say that you bought 100 units in 1995 i.e for Rs.1 L and held it till today i.e. till 2020  3/n #hold #investments<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For this study, we will be considering the Nifty 50 index which is India's benchmark index.  The base value of Nifty 50 is considered as the closing value on 3 November, 1995, by the NSE. So we will be considering this as our starting value.  2/n #nifty #study<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just follow these steps :  1) Find the price at which you will conclude that your trade is wrong  2) Calculate your % risk on capital  3) Size your positions such that when you're wrong according to 1 above, you lose only the predefined % on capital.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is an index ?  #index #nifty #sensex  https://t.co/xcqm0YqI6z<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whenever you want to measure how the market is doing you can take a look at Nifty or Sensex.

<|startoftext|>@himanshu27795 Thanks Himanshu ! This means a lot 😇  That's a great suggestion. Will definitely do it !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you pick stocks of something which you don't deeply understand, you could land up in big trouble !  If you know how to read financials, they usually give hints as to when the business is in trouble and when we should sell the stock!  I hope you learned something knew !😊 (n/n)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The reason why I brought this up is to show you why you SHOULDN'T invest in stocks yourself !  In the Business world, it's not so straight forward.  If you can't read financial statements like this and interpret its meaning, you should strictly avoid stock picking.  (8/n) #stocks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the Franchise business of McDonald's is simply more profitable and way more stable. That why McDonald's does this !  Selling McDonald's burgers gives a good source of income to the tenants to pay the hefty rent of McDonald's !  (7/n) #rent #realestate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did you get it ? Let me help you !  It's bcoz in order to make $9.4B from selling burgers the company has to spend $7.7B !  And to earn $21.6B, from rent and royalty, the company just has to spend $2.2B !  (6/n) #spend #profit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But why does McDonald's do that ? Why doesn't it just sell burgers and keep the entire profit ?  It's a no brainer ! We again take a look at the financial statements given !  Look at the 2 lines below "Operating Cost and Expenses" !  (5/n) #operations #expenses<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the words of the former CFO of McDonald's,"McDonald's is not a burger company, it's a Real Estate company!"  So McDonald's rents out property and charges a royalty on using its brand name. The tenant sells McDonald's burgers,pays the rent and royalty and keeps the profit (4/n)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you take a look at the revenue breakdown, out of $21B in total revenue, about $9.4B comes from "company operated restaurants" i.e. from selling burgers !  The remaining revenue of about $11.6B comes from Franchise Royalty and Rent !!  (3/n) #rent #royalty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, McDonald's isn't a Burger company bcoz most of the revenue that McDonald's makes doesn't come from selling burgers !  Then what does it come from ?  Let's take a look at it's financial statements !  (2/n) #revenue #financials  https://t.co/e8pPS4YLEc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I say McDonald's, what comes to your mind ?   Burgers, right ?  But if I tell you that McDonald's is not a burger company.....will you be surprised ?  Then you should be, because IT ISN'T A BURGER COMPANY !!  (1/n) #burger #mcdonalds<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nishchalgarg8 @Abhishekkar_ Very true brother. He's the best 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RetracementT Thankyou Sir 😊 Really appreciate it !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Frankly speaking, Buffett's strategy is quite scalable. Simon's Medallion Fund is maintained at $10 B to achieve those returns. His other funds don't make that much returns which everyone knows him for. The comparison would be fair if Simon's manages capital at Buffet's level.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Oh wow... I didn't know that we get that feature on IBKR. Thanks 😊  Why don't Indian brokers bring it on their platforms ?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Some of you must be thinking that Bears don't make money and only Bulls do.  That's not true. Even bears can make money in the stock markets.   Yes, even when the markets do down 👇 people make money !  But that's for another day ! 😉  Share this with your dogs and cats ! #pets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Similarly, a Bear is someone who expects the markets to go 'Down' 👇  They are called bears bcoz a bear pins it's opponents down when it attacks.  So if you expect the markets to go down, you are a "bear" and the market is "bearish" for you!  (3/n) #bear #bearish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A Bull in the markets is someone who expects the markets to go 'Up' 👆  They are called bulls bcoz a bull throws it's opponents up when it attacks.  So if you expect the markets to go up, you are a "bull" and the market is "bullish" !  (2/n) #bull #bullish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Animals in the stock markets !  You must have come across phrases like   "Bulls take the markets up!" "Bears crashed the markets!" "Market is in a Bull phase!" "Gold looks bearish!" etc.  What do they even mean ? Why are we talking about animals ?  (1/n)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FinsenseG @AdityaD_Shah @adi2five Thanks 😊<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So if a robber loots the entire bank including the ATMs he'll get only 18% of the deposits.   Rest, 79% is free for the banks to lend and mint money ! 💰  More on Reserve Ratios later. Did you know RBI controls inflation using these ratios ?  (8/n) #inflation #control<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually, banks can't lend out 100% of our money. #RBI does not allow that. Banks ka bas chale to poora hi dede !!  RBI controls this by using Reserve Ratios. Currently, RR is 21% out which 3% is deposited with the RBI.  So banks hold only 18% of our money rn. (7/n)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The difference is that when we deposit money we don't ask the bank for collateral whereas when we borrow from the bank they ask either our car/bike/house/mobile/FD/kidney 😉 etc. as collateral !   Banks love to play the safe game !  Aur safety ki baat hum karte hain (6/n)  #safe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The difference b/w the interest they charge from the borrower and the interest they pay to the depositor, is their profit and this is called the 'Net Interest Spread'  That's why borrowing interest is higher than deposit interest.  (5/n) #spread<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you deposit your money and as soon as the cashier hits enter, it's gone......GAYA....CHUMANTAR !!  For banks, your money is just numbers on the screen. Your deposit goes into the hands of a borrower in the fraction of seconds !  (4/n) #borrower #lender<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scary right ? Relax and read !  You know that banks make money by lending to borrowers. Where does that come from ? If you don't know, IT'S YOUR MONEY !!  They take money from depositors and lend it to borrowers !  (3/n) #deposit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So you wanna know where banks hide your money ?  They don't !  Yupp !  Infact they don't even have your money 😂  If some day all depositors go to the banks and altogether ask to return their money, they won't be able to coz they just don't have it ! 🤣  (2/n) #banking #savings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you really think that banks protect your hard-earned money in highly secured vaults as shown in movies ?  Do you think that banks would take the risk of a "Dhoom 3" movie character to come and rob them of your money ?   Let's see where they hide our money !  (1/n) #banks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adi2five 😂 Desperate times call for Desi measures !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@himanshu27795 You are not alone brother 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stop overthinking. Just do it !  Learn from your mistakes as you do it. If you try to plan out everything before you start, you never will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shares aka equity is one of the major asset classes and has been one of the greatest wealth creators  For beating inflation, you must think about allocating some capital in the share market, depending on your risk taking ability after consulting your financial advisor (8/n)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Eg: If the share of Tata company now becomes Rs.2 and you own 100 shares, your capital just became Rs.200  So the profit is 200-100 = Rs.100  And, if the price becomes 0 ! 😬 You just lost Rs.100   This is the "risk" in the share market ! (7/n)  #risk #loss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ideally, you get a small portion of the profits only as dividends since the company needs to keep its profits for survival.  The other and the more prominent way by which shareholders profit is Capital Appreciation  This happens when the price/ 'bhav' of the share increases (6/n)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So how do you profit in the share market.  Two ways : - Capital Appreciation - Dividends  Dividends are a share in the profits of a business. Eg: If the Tata company you hold earns Rs.100 and they decide to give it to shareholders then you get 10% of 100=Rs.10 👈Dividend (5/n)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Basically, this is what stocks/shares are. A shareholder becomes a partner/ 'hissedaar' in a business, in simpler terms.  The ecosystem in which shares are traded is called the "Share Market"  Needless to say now, Share Market is not "Satta Bazaar"🙏 (4/n)  #casino #gambling 😁😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's say, Tata company has 1000 shares for Rs.1 each. So the total market value of the company is 1000×Rs.1=Rs.1000  Now, let's say instead of buying a Diary Milk for Rs.100, you buy 100 shares of Tata company.  Congrats, you now own 10% of Tata ! 👏  (3/n)  #tata #owner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Simply put, a stock represents a fractional "ownership" in a company.  When you buy a stock of a company, you fractionally "own" the company.  So it's not gambling !  You're investing your money into "real" businesses worth crores/millions !  (2/n)  #investing #business<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What are stocks ?   You must have heard me or someone else singing "Stocks,stocks !" all the time.  Is it gambling or 'jua' or 'satta' ?  Is it a scam ? Is it a get-rich-quick scheme ?  Read on ! (1/n)  #stocks #StockMarket<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gupta__khushi Good one 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Try this quiz out. It's not so simple ! 😁😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vineetpatawari @vivbajaj @elearnmarkets @vineetpatawari Sir I've messaged you the question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vineetpatawari @vivbajaj @elearnmarkets Yes the stock exchange one Sir<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vivbajaj It was a fun quiz Sir 😊  Pls check the answer to question No. 6. I think the answer is wrong.  @elearnmarkets @vineetpatawari<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kirubaakaran Yes they are more irritating than the ones who don't even use it 😂  Atleast they don't abuse the system !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are many other things regarding inflation but that's for a later date 😊  Agar is post mein kuch samajh mein aaya ho, to like karein ! Agar nahin aaya ho, to comment karein !   Have a good day ! (n/n)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So if you want to beat inflation, you should invest into assets whose prices increase due to inflation. This is called "inflation hedging".   Ideally, you should be holding money/cash/cash equivalents for the least amount of time possible. (7/n)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But inflation is not so bad altogether. For some people, inflation works in their favour !   For people who hold assets like stocks, real estate, commodities etc. When inflation or "mehengai" increases, the price/value of assets also increases.😉 (6/n)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Technically, you are "saving" when you are matching inflation i.e. for 1% increase in inflation your wealth also increases 1%. In this scenario you are protecting the value of your money.  Similarly, if you want to call it "investing" you should atleast "beat" inflation. (5/n)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@himanshu27795 Thanks a lot Himanshu Bhai 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After 20 years, you took the piggy bank and decided to buy the toffees.   Unfortunately, now the toffee costs Rs.1.33 (Assuming average inflation of 5%)  Now you can buy only 75 toffees instead of 200 😬  20 years wasted !!  Inflation is the reason why "savers are losers"!  (4/n)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Eg: Let's say you had Rs.100 in your piggy bank as a kid in 2000 and with this amount you could buy 200 toffees, back then, i.e. Rs.0.5/toffee  Your parents said not to buy it now and to save the money. Later you can buy more. You said, "Ok !" and saved it.  (3/n)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is a factor which we middle class people usually ignore in our personal finances.  The fact that money loses its value due to inflation might sound to a lot of people but it's true.  It's very important to be able to atleast beat inflation while saving or investing. (2/n)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's talk about inflation. The reason why money LOSES its value over time.  In simple terms, Inflation is the rate of increase in general price levels in the economy over a period of time.   It is used to measure how much value a currency has lost in the same period !

<|startoftext|>If you've learned something from this post, do share this knowledge with people around you.   I'm not asking you to share "my post". I'm asking you to share "the knowledge" !  Hope this has helped someone 😇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not posting this to scare you out of the markets but to make you aware.  Why do you think people post such things ? Because their audience loves to see such stupidity. People are too naive to understand that such information is totally useless to make an informed decision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not so easy to make money in the markets. Remember, 99% of the people who buy stocks "themselves" lose their money in 5 years !  I can also show an infinite number of examples of such stocks. But does that mean that it will give the same returns again. Not necessarily !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Measuring the stocks performance from the absolute lows to the absolute highs is one of the stupidest analysis out there and taking an investment decision based on this info could be your biggest mistake.  Nobody, I mean nobody can pick the exact tops and bottoms.   Read again 👆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you want to take home anything from this thread, let it be this 👇  "Past performance is never an indication of future results !"  This is very true in the financial markets.  Even if you're buying mutual funds never buy a fund because it gave the highest returns in the past !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this is the chart of this year and 25 Feb 2020 was the highest point. Do you really think someone who has been holding for 12 years would have sold when the markets were making All-Time-Highs, just before the Coronavirus Crash. Ask yourself !!  https://t.co/XP1SsAIwQN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the chart of the same stock and 2 Dec 2008 was the lowest point in many years.   Remember, 2008 was the year of the Global Financial Crisis. Do you really think people would have bought stocks after the global markets crashed ? Ask yourself !!  https://t.co/nP8Oo6x7iJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The problem is that the stock "was a multibagger". Take a look at the dates mentioned in the post. If bought on 2 Dec 2008 and sold on 25 Feb 2020, it would've given 36× returns !  Have you ever wondered why such specific dates ? Let me show you !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's wrong with this ? You might ask.  Take a look at the number of likes this post had.... 5000+ !!   If 5000 have liked then at least 1-2% i.e. 50-100 people must have decided to buy the stock !  Now you might ask, what's wrong with that ? The stock is a multibagger !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's about posts like these ! If you've been following the markets for some time you must've come across such posts on social media etc.  https://t.co/n7kh7EhmLI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's tweet is about an issue which irritates me a lot.   I can't imagine the number of people who must have lost a lot of money in the stock markets due to this stupidity.  If you've been making this mistake, please stop and share this to your dear ones ! 🙏<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan I used to struggle with overnight risk.   The only fix I can think of is reducing position sizes. Even if the markets gap down you should lose only a very small portion of your capital.  Gradually use your profits, if any, to scale up.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RupeshKumarGar4 @TraderHarneet Acha...aapko kaise pata hai ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@himanshu27795 Yes, you have a point there. Risk taking ability is killed during childhood and conservative mindset prevents people from taking even reasonable risks to at least beat inflation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This doesn't mean that FDs are totally useless. You can use it for :-  1).Storing liquid cash (Liquidity means quick access)  2).Parking surplus investible funds when you don't have an opportunity to invest  Basically, FDs can/should be used to STORE cash, not to GROW wealth.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ST_PYI @garyvee He's one of the most inspirational rags to riches guy out there. Down to earth and always adding value to the society 😇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#savings #savingmoney #fixeddeposit #inflation #bankdeposit #economy #personalfinance #finance #money<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This difference might seem small but add in more money, heavy taxes, bank charges and compounding, and you just wasted decades of your life doing a blunder.  If you're doing this you're only making you banks and governments rich !  Conclusion : SAVERS ARE LOSERS !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let me explain !  Let's say, you save Rs.1L in an FD for 5 years and assuming that interest rates don't change, you'll have Rs.1,30,078 ( BEFORE TAXES ! )  And something which costed you Rs.1L now costs Rs.1,42,498 !  That's a Rs.12,420 loss on a principal of Rs.1L = -12.4% 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're obsessive about bank deposits, read this !  Current inflation rate in India is 7.34% and the interest rate of a SBI FD for general public is 5.4 % only (pre tax).  So if you think that by making an FD, you're saving money, you are wrong !  You're LOSING MONEY !!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This mindset is very important for an investor.  You should always be analyzing risk. Whenever you buy a stock you are exposing your capital to risk in the expectation of a reward.  'Assessing' and 'being cognizant' of the risk involved is essential.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thanks for all the answers. Really appreciate it.   What I've concluded is that, it's better for part-time traders to automate swing trades rather than intraday. The system should be on a cloud and I should use TG to get alerts and intervene if needed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would love to hear an answer from @f2003062 @theBuoyantMan @kirubaakaran @algotemple @vivpahwa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it advisable for part-time traders (who can't attend to the system at all) to deploy fully automated intraday algorithms ? What are the risks involved ? Should they automate short term swing trading strategies or should they stick to only EOD basis trading ?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bhomik1998 @vivbajaj @mystockedge @vinaypagaria Yes Sir.   Please use dual colour themes like black and blue or white and blue.   In my opinion these are great for UI as they are pleasing to the eyes.  Eg: Twitter, Facebook, Zerodha etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rishikesh_ADX @VijayKedia1 Agreed.  It's not necessary but it may be helpful. Doing an MBA, CA etc. is atleast better than a non-finance degree if one seriously wants to pursue a career in the markets.  I may be biased but that's my view 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan @vishpratiksha @MrigankPuri Totally agree with both @theBuoyantMan and @vishpratiksha.

<|startoftext|>@vineetpatawari ITC.   Yes, I agree it could be undervalued and may run up in the future but defending every claim against that assumption is quite close minded in my view.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rohit_katwal @remindmetweets 11th Oct 5:30 PM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vineetpatawari Yes. That is really dangerous. It requires a lot of skill for a good analyst to even reach a ballpark figure. Any "precise" future assumption is probably false.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kalpeshmewada49 @Abhishekkar_ Hota hai 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Prashantshah267 Can you please share the resource Sir ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Exactly. Jisko seekhna hoga, seekh lega.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachitpjain Need to do 2,3 and 4 now. Thanks for the suggestion 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kirubaakaran @theBuoyantMan @f2003062 Understood Sir. I'll surely check that out. Thanks 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan @kirubaakaran @f2003062 Yes..candlestick patterns are logical but I can't find any logic for visual patterns.  I tried using William's fractals but that didn't work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tejaskhoday @fyers1 30 days is too less to make that conclusion. Don't you think ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is there a way to backtest price action patterns like ascending triangle etc. ? Or is it possible manually only ?  @theBuoyantMan @kirubaakaran @f2003062<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ For a second I thought this was real ! 😂 Where is dmu___'s shareholding ?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TraderDivergent Congratulations Alan !   You're doing a great job. I've learnt a lot from your tweets 😊  Keep it up ! 👍<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StocksNerd Understood Sir. Thanks 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StocksNerd Sir how do you trail your SL ? Do you follow a rule for it ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ We know who you are talking about Sir. Sabka din aayega !   Aaj jo dusro ko gaali bak raha hai, logo par thook raha hai, logo ko badnaam kar raha hai, kal usko apne karmo ka fal milega.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Very excited Sir. Let's do it !! 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan I did science in school and by accident I'm pursuing CA now. Living the best days of my life right now. Every word I read is useful in practical. Even I regret studying science. Could've saved 2 whole years !!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ @pawanaroraleo @Mitesh_Engr Kya koi teachers se poochta hai 10th ki marksheet, 12th ki marksheet, graduation marksheet wagera ? Waha to chupchap fees bhar dete ho with no career guarantee. Wo bhi scammer hai ?   Trading is a profession. Profession seekhane ke liye thoda charge karliya to kya dikkat hai ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you don't know Mark Minervini, he is one of the best performing traders out there. For all the jerks who say that one should make an income out of trading "alone", read point 4 ! If he is saying so, there must be some logic.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Hehe....Sir ke uppercase "ONLY" aur "OWN" mein hi jawaab chupa hai !! 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ @theshivambedi 😂 It would be horrible if these guys start calling these people also scammers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ @theshivambedi Sir in logo ke hisaab se to sab SCAM hai. Sablog khud hi trade karke kama lenge. Ads, join button, subscription, consultation, advisory etc. sab scam hai. Meine Indore ke scammers ke baare mein suna hai...aajkal South Africa mein baithke organized SCAM kiya ja raha hai.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shritesh6 Wahi to !! Aur operator see "Jung" kaun karta hai ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shritesh6 😂 Operator se jang !! 2500 profit ke liye ! 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kirubaakaran Got it 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kirubaakaran Is this inspired from the turtle trading system ?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Sir can you please recommend some Coursera courses for quantitative finance ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan 21300 CE for the higher delta, right ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shritesh6 Understood 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shritesh6 Baat to Sahi hai..😁 Fir confidence kaise aayega Sir ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shritesh6 Sir how to gain confidence for discretionary trading ? Eg: for systematic we can backtest but how to do it in discretionary ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Warren Buffett maybe ? Of course not an option seller primarily but don't know anyone else with 15+ year experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ The Big Short<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Sir I think there target audience is also of the same category. Anyways, it's clear that anchors don't have even a small idea about the markets but behave as if they do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProdigalTrader 2 is what we want, 1 is what some people are doing nowadays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan @theRealKiyosaki advised in his book "The Cashflow Quadrant" that in order to succeed in business one should have a good understanding of   1). Accounting 2).

<|startoftext|>@shritesh6 I just watched the whole video....it's horrible but such videos keep us grounded<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shritesh6 This is disturbing to even watch. Can't even imagine what that guy went through !! 😨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. Jordan Belfort was a broker/merchant banker. He is one of the best salesmen out there but not a trader/investor. What you saw in "The Wolf of Wall Street" is not really how Wall Street works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ @TraderHarneet @ArjunB9591 @RajarshitaS @CAtLarge @TwitterSupport @Twitter Is it happening with Fintwit accounts only ? 🤔 Something's fishy then !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Social media hatred on all time high. Some people have been irrationally misleading others. Don't know why. Jo sabko scammer bolta hai wahi sabse bada scammer hota hai.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@youngtrader17 Caplin is a good pick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ If I'm not wrong Paul Tudor Jones said that right ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AjayJKrishnan @ezwealthonline Nice introductory article on Forex 😊   Do you know why isn't fx spot trading allowed in India like other countries ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Dividends should never be the first reason to invest in a stock. If you want cashflow, put your money in a fixed income instrument. At least you'd be sure that your capital is not going down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. Traders never care where the markets go. They can make money even when the markets don't move. It's only the media that creates panic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trader19861 @theBuoyantMan understood Sir...thanks 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trader19861 @theBuoyantMan So it's basically to handle multiple accounts right ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@langvalcapital What should be the ideal position limit in percentage terms Sir ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Markets are ruthless ! Take everything and everyone with a pinch of salt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Best channel I've learnt from is Ukspreadbetting. Highly underrated channel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Congratulations Sir. Happy to be a part of your journey. Learning a lot from you 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ That would be great Sir. Directional view using charts would be enough. 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ashutosh_thute @Abhishekkar_ It's not about live streaming. SEBI doesn't allow it !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Isn't he legit ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shritesh6 Ohh...well he used to say that he doesn't invest in IPOs !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shritesh6 Is he doing it for listing gains ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AjayJKrishnan How do you set a time based target Sir ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Change your perspective. Buy good companies at a discount when the markets fall !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watch out !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shritesh6 Got it Sir. Thanks 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shritesh6 Sir would you suggest deep ITM options for this ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kirubaakaran Probably one of the of the most important rules of system trading. Otherwise what's the difference between system trading and discretionary trading ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StocksNerd 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@devanshurailtel Sorry, I didn't know this. Thanks a lot 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AjayJKrishnan Kollaam 👌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AjayJKrishnan Where is this Sir ? Looks amazing !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@devanshurailtel @Abhishekkar_ Can you pls share the link ? I'd like to read this in detail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndiaAryaNation @Abhishekkar_ @GrantCardone If you aren't satisfied with it then you should increase your cashflow. Simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martinamcd101 @GrantCardone @realDonaldTrump "Fraud" and "swindling" ?! Ok, I give up. I think we shouldn't waste more of our time on this topic. If you really think he's that evil, it's your duty to make sure he doesn't win 😊 Best wishes !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kirubaakaran I'm just waiting for the day when he'll see "Maine bola tha" ! Hope it comes before the end of the world 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@devanshurailtel @Abhishekkar_ Why would Xerox sell the idea to Steve ? Both gates and jobs were involved. I agree to your second point though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Edit: financial suicide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Learnt it from @GrantCardone. If you can't buy it from 1 week of cashflow, don't buy it. Or you should get reasonable tax deductions on the purchase+maintenance. Debt should only be used to buy assets not liabilities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ I usually try avoiding such conversations because it's quite hard to change their prejudice but sometimes it becomes intractable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@himanshu27795 @Abhishekkar_ Sure bro...I'm just starting out on quora   https://t.co/ZXT1Gf2MR9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ It's really irritating especially when people judge and whine about what successful people do rather than learning from them. Recently, I replied to a quora post which said that Mukesh Ambaniji shouldn't have spent $2 B on his home. Instead he should have donated that money.  https://t.co/kdJ2rz5dc1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martinamcd101 @GrantCardone @realDonaldTrump I'm sorry. It's "just" $2.5 B ! Damn, it's not enough. Probably, you're right. Biden is worthy. He's the perfect candidate. If only he was President, US wouldn't be troubled with Covid. Go for it 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Try it out 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martinamcd101 @GrantCardone @realDonaldTrump And still worth $4 Billion ! Isn't that the classic American story which everyone talks about ? Don't you want someone who knows how to pull an organisation out of deep shit ? Why do you think his slogan is "Make America Great Again" ? He's just pulling USA out of the Obama shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Drrajeshbheda Thanks. As expected I couldn't find this anywhere. This is really unprofessional. Market views go wrong quite a lot of time. People shouldn't take it personally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShyamanujSaikia Bro it's on sale for 19999 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrantCardone @realDonaldTrump anyday. I wouldn't want Biden anywhere near my business. IMO every state head should have run a business. Why should people vote for someone to lead the country when he/she can't even run a company ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Drrajeshbheda @Abhishekkar_ Ohh...that's bad. Anchors should behave professionally at least on business channels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TihoBrkan For me it would be a balance of both.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adi2five Looking forward to it 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShyamanujSaikia Yehi to chahiye tha 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AgarwalBinayak @FI_InvestIndia That's great advice Bhai 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan @AdityaD_Shah @adi2five @AnyBodyCanFly Yeah I noticed that. Within the past few months he broke quite a few of his "rules" which he preaches everywhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Drrajeshbheda @Abhishekkar_ What happened last week ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't understand.   Buffett said that he doesn't invest in Gold because it doesn't add any value ?  Then why did he invest in silver in the past ?  @AdityaD_Shah @adi2five @AnyBodyCanFly @theBuoyantMan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AjayJKrishnan @AdityaD_Shah @AnishA_Moonka Agreed 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@f2003062 Understood Sir. Thanks 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@f2003062 Sir how do you allocate capital to multiple strategies ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a must. Stay away from stock picking if you don't understand the meaning of terms like receivables, operating cash flow, EBITDA, cost of capital etc.  Even Buffett bought his first stock at 11 using PB ratio etc.   Learn the language of business before buying one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@f2003062 Exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@f2003062 Exactly.  If everyone would analyze the markets equally and do the same things, how will the markets work ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvesysCapital Pls tell me if there is a more prejudiced and biased person than Arnab Goswami ?   It always seems like it's a debate of AG Vs panelist instead of panelist Vs panelist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan I really didn't know this. Now I'll have a good point to make with my brother as to why he shouldn't drop out. Thanks for the myth busting Sir 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is one of the secrets which the rich and powerful don't want you to know !  #schools #education<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RetracementT 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rohitjoshilko @firstgen_wealth @AdityaD_Shah As much as I've comprehended "coffee can investing" is about buying and forgetting about it.   Yes, Buffett has held on to stocks for 20 years but not all of his portfolio. He keeps churning his portfolio from bad/overvalued businesses to good/undervalued ones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@firstgen_wealth @AdityaD_Shah Well if you follow "buy and hold forever" strategy, under the current conditions it would be pretty difficult to reach 1/100 of their....  I'm not criticizing anyone, just saying what I've learnt from Buffett. When it's time to sell a business, we should !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdityaD_Shah This is going to get interesting !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShyamanujSaikia Congrats Bhai 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@moneyandgoals @Abhishekkar_ He is saying that it's not possible to compound/make money "daily". No one is underestimating compounding here ! 😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StocksNerd Came through my scanner as well. Stochastic is showing bullish hidden divergence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This trend is clearly going to increase.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did @Twitter remove the advanced search option ? I can't find it. #twitter #TwitterDown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One should have reasonable allocation to debt/fixed income instruments like FDs, bonds etc. in one's portfolio. It adds liquidity to your capital plus it diversifies your risk to a less correlated asset class.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@f2003062 Understood Sir. Thanks 😊  And 20L is pretty big for me Sir. I've only seen you trading pretty big size on zerodha, that's why I thought of asking you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@f2003062 Have you ever faced any problems with their platforms while algo/manual trading ?  (I'm asking bcoz if you are using them with big capital, then they must be pretty reliable)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Sir would you still recommend Finvasia ? Did you ever have any problems with them ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@f2003062 Sir what's your review on zerodha ? Do you use it to deploy your entire capital ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@competentTrades @Abhishekkar_ Acha...😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@competentTrades @Abhishekkar_ It's not his quote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StocksNerd Got it Sir. Thanks 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShyamanujSaikia @ArthaDoot Hehe...sahi baat hai. Apne liye listing gains hi bohut hota hai 😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're planning to do something meaningful with your life, at least half an hour of reading is a must ! Doesn't matter what you read as long as you are learning anything which might help you in the future. #Reading #bibliophile<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShyamanujSaikia @ArthaDoot Congrats Bhai...is it for long-term or listing gains ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnandableAnand @theBuoyantMan @kirubaakaran I think he needs the top gainers/losers in pre-open in Nifty 50<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StocksNerd Sir how many open positions should we have in our portfolio at any given time ? Should we limit it or just take as many trades as possible keeping the risk per trade intact ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed. Most people would take this as an excuse to avoid trying to be wealthy. You should be aware of the good and the ugly. Everything comes with a price !  But the reward is way more than the price !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderHarneet Oh so you are looking for pullbacks. Got it Sir. Thanks 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderHarneet Sir like the ones above. Were you looking for such setups (weak hands thrown out) or were you just saying from analysis ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderHarneet Wow...great psychological analysis. Sir is this setup systematic or is it discretionary ? How can we systemize psychological trades ?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Avoid biases while investing.   If you think something will go up, find reasons why it may go down and vice versa, with an open mind.  If you think you made a mistake, accept it and correct it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Hypocrisy at it's best !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderHarneet Managing other people's money is also a form of leverage. It should not be avoided, it should be used wisely. Financial business is the definition of leverage and no one knows it better than Buffett and Munger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RetracementT 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vineetpatawari 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShyamanujSaikia Understood Bhai. It's a good way to deal with revenge/overtrading.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShyamanujSaikia Do you get setups only during these sessions or you have just limited it ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vineetpatawari Agreed.  Even if they do they only focus on saving without really exploring the investing side of wealth building.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShyamanujSaikia On an average how many trades do you take per day, while scalping ?  Do you scalp all day or during certain sessions only ?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Use the fear of others to buy in and the greed of others to sell out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan You just summarized my strategy. I use a volatility based trailing SL and exit if price takes resistance at important price levels bcoz it's hard to get 3x and above when markets are non-trending. Yes, data is not available and I had to backtest it for a few months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm in the same age group and I can't believe how people go to this extent.  Firstly, don't go this extent that you have to end your life. Remember what RJ sahab says, "Risk only what you can afford to lose".  Secondly, don't go and ask people for their money.  EARN it !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adi2five Wow that's great. I wish my mom would say that one day 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you are trying to be successful and if you still watch the TV including news, you are absolutely wasting your time.   Instead read a book, spend time with loved ones, talk a walk or do something else.  Think about it. #ditchthetv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan 1). ukspreadbetting 2). Smb Capital  These are two highly underrated channels with good focus on trading psychology and habits. Must watch their videos. They are gold. I've learnt most of my trading from 1 and learning advanced stuff from both.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. What's the point of being financially free by 65 ? What will you spend it on ...... Health expenses ? If you're in your 20s you should aim to be free by 40. No point of freedom, if you can't live to savour it.  Disclaimer: I'm not financially free myself 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvesysCapital Understood Sir. Thanks 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvesysCapital Sir, if a trader is experienced with a consistent track record, should he use borrowed money to trade ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you only have one source of income, read this !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Thankyou Sir. Appreciate it 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan @ani578 Oh...ok Sir 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan 1).Sir how to learn python for algos ? 2).How many strategies should we have in our playbook ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ani578 @theBuoyantMan Is this your book Sir ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderHarneet Ok sir 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderHarneet Sirji I'm thinking of creating a strategy to trade these patterns specifically. Like in the above example, if I spot this pattern I would take a short trade and vice versa. Does it sound good ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sanjufunda Ye sab SEBI ka kaam thodi na hai Sir 😁 SEBI to abhi ye soch rahi hogi ki aur liquidity kaise kam kare. Arnab Goswami shayad pata laga lega.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@adi2five @TataCompanies Haha nice 👌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Sir ab to bol hi do, "Time for swing shorts" 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Exactly !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Perfectly said..to the point. Let alone investing. Even salaried employees are not so "moral" as they perceive themselves to be. I specifically said "salaried" bcoz they are the ones who like to find faults with businesses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan @langvalcapital He is really good. I followed him when I noticed that even @markminervini follows him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TihoBrkan These extreme cult types are horrible....trading Vs investing, stocks Vs RE, savings Vs spending etc. Why can't people try to balance these rather than justify which one's better over the other ?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@adi2five Got it Sir. Thanks 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adi2five Thanks...and how many years of reports did you read ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adi2five Woww...it's going to be interesting 😊 Can you pls tell which companies you covered ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be different ! Don't try to please everyone around you. They'll never understand you and you should never expect them to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Less of their daily P/L, setups etc. and more of strategy building, backtesting, money management, other sources of income, personal development habits, leverage management (margin,debt and OPM) etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RIP Chadwick Boseman 😔 #chadwickbosman #WakandaForever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saw many comments on @Abhishekkar_ Sir's latest podcast, that they were introverts and couldn't do networking.   Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk etc. are also "introverts" but they've to speak to the public and "network".   Pls stop making excuses and move out of your comfort zone !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderDivergent @SJosephBurns Yes. Also it's very important to keep our positions as small as possible for the first 1-2 years so that we don't blow up our capital while learning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TihoBrkan Fed is an idiot's best friend 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlogJulianKomar I just have 1 intraday setup. Currently working on a swing setup 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly !! You need financial wisdom to retain wealth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jangirm215 Thankyou Bhai 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jangirm215 Already done with 1 year of only learning, back testing and paper trading. Will begin trading with small qty after 2 months 😊 It's better to first learn than blow up an account and give up trading.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TraderHarneet Binod 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mitesh_Engr @imTkarmarkar Perfect reply<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sandrocottos @jangirm215 Sir @jangirm215 Bhai specifically asked for RA and RA is not just for job seekers. You can also sell your service as a RA. Also CAs are not totally exempted from SEBI reg. Only "incidental advice" is allowed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sandrocottos @jangirm215 Bhai I don't have much knowledge about IAs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sandrocottos @jangirm215 Sir this is from a FAQ published by SEBI.  https://t.co/HA3Wh0beap<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jangirm215 Eligibility: 1). Grad + PG, or 2). Grad + 5 year work ex. in finance In both cases, NISM RA certificate is required Pros - you can sell your advice/analysis, which is illegal otherwise. Cons - Personal trading restrictions (Google it, it's complicated) Even CFA etc. need reg.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShauryaRastogii @adi2five I think Bloomberg provides that data, right ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Charity is the best thing we can do. I don't expect to prosper more by charity bcoz the fact that I can be charitable is itself prosperity 😇 #becharitable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adi2five I feel I'm lucky to see all of India working towards a common goal. 😊 We'll surely get through this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Thanks for this thread Sir. This has cleared a lot of doubts 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderDivergent Letting profits run is an acquired skill and seeing a profitable trade turn into a break even or losing one is tough especially when the trader is just starting out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piyushchaudhry Greta to SEBI after reading your tweet -  https://t.co/i8Vtv2G4Cu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShyamanujSaikia Got it. 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShyamanujSaikia Bhai how did you adjust your options trade today ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelRosmer @TihoBrkan How to build that image in the beginning ? Especially for managing OPM ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Then there is PMS which should be SEBI rgd. Minimum capital per investor Rs.25L but pooling is not allowed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan IAs should not have traded the script 30 days before and 5 days after giving the advice. So it's better to trade personally from a different entity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan As far as I know we can pool money as a partnership without any compliance. For a pvt company, we need NBFC registration from RBI. For IA service, we can employ a SEBI registered IA and that is enough to register the firm as an IA firm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@apeksha02 You're right. My method also includes my time spent infront of the screen post market including charts, coding, backtesting etc., on learning like books, blogs, videos, meditation etc. Ultimately, whatever I do to perform better the next day is productive work for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TihoBrkan Being a wealth manager yourself, do you think that formal education like MBA helps in establishing credibility or a good track record is enough ? Would it really help in networking, marketing etc. ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@apeksha02 IMO trading is performance oriented. Hence I use a defined set of rules to measure my performance on the basis of execution, risk management, confidence etc. and keep a track of my score out of 10.0 points. I try to remove all subjectivity from this equation just like a robot 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParthDhadhal @Mitesh_Engr Thankyou Bhai for this thread. Bookmarked 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachitpjain Sir do you use trailing SL or exit on signs of reversal ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chintanchheda Where is it used Sir ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShyamanujSaikia Looks like operators are following your tweets 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Taking 100% responsibility for whatever happens in our lives gives us total control over both success and failure.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dkjain89 Yes Sir. We want it !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jangirm215 How to get better at spotting price patterns ? What books or resources do you recommend for learning PA trading ? #askMJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Aap dealer se bhi trade karte hain ? Kyu sir ? Margin zyada milta hai kya ? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProdigalTrader Very very true Sir. Nowadays my setup is primarily based on horizontal S/R lines only. And I prefer to use mechanical ones instead of discretionary 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's really irritating !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a remarkable achievement. I'm sure under @narendramodi ji's government India will become one of the biggest exporter of goods and services 😊  #Capitalism #capitalistindia<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@anilbalaji11 It would've been good but it's not possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dkjain89 Thankyou Sir. I'm a beginner in options and these views with logic really helps. 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShyamanujSaikia Bhai option selling mein SL rakhte ho ya adjust karte ho ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dkjain89 Yes 0.2% consistent profit is enough. Pls share the data Sir 🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Thankyou Sir. I prefer terminal for execution 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RetracementT Thankyou Sir 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Sir do you recommend Kotak's FIT plan instead of zerodha ? Is it legitimate ? 999 a year sounds too less to be true for a bank based broker !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RetracementT Ok Sir. Do you watch global sentiments during the entire session or just for the opening ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RetracementT Sir how much correlation is there b/w Indian and global markets ? I just know that the opening is more or less related to sgx and other Asian markets. What about the others Sir ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marketcalls_ @piyushchaudhry Thanks 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marketcalls_ @piyushchaudhry How can we access this ? Is it paid ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShyamanujSaikia @dkjain89 Sure. Thanks 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShyamanujSaikia Acha. Mujhe options ki zyada knowledge nahin hai so kuch samajh nahin aaya 😁😅 Waise USDINR ke options liquid hote hai kya ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rishikesh_ADX Possibly. I'm just going with the trend 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShyamanujSaikia Sahi hai Bhai. Naked selling kardi ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And people nowadays complain about discount brokers like @zerodhaonline going down two-three times a year even after giving discounted brokerage and best quality platforms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nikhil9011 @markminervini Congratulations brother 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. Debt is not so evil !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adi2five @hvgoenka He is truly an inspiration for all of us 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tony_Immanuvel @SarangSood Thankyou Sir. Really needed someone to clarify this 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tony_Immanuvel @SarangSood Ohh..understood Sir 😊 And how do you track a synthetic fut's price ? Do you plot a chart or something ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TihoBrkan That is why I asked. The feedback from Indian RE investors hasn't been good. Thanks for the reply Tiho 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TihoBrkan Hi Tiho. Do you think it would be good to start a real estate business in India ? If yes, what would you recommend a 20 year old like me to get started ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdgeCGroup It's the same everywhere. I think humans naturally are risk averse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarangSood How can we use it to adjust Sir ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Everyone told me, not to see, They said it's a waste of money, Still I bought you, dear ITC,  Now please forgive me,  And let me be 🙏😭  Disclaimer: I don't hold ITC 😂🤘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kamath_nikhil @ForbesAdvisor Hello Sir. I've heard that it's very difficult to operate an AIF III in India due to tight regulations. Is it true ? How are you pulling it off with True Beacon ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarangSood I'm sorry. I didn't understand it. As far as I know, synthetic futures is a directional options strategy. How do we follow it as an index to adjust straddles ? Can someone pls explain it ? 🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ 😂 Humare Big Bear 🤘 Sir humein bhi de dena mithai SM pe 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is hands down, the best business in the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Oh Harvard ones on YouTube right ? I'd downloaded them already but had a hard time understanding 😅 Will definitely go through it again 😊 Thankyou Sir.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SJosephBurns Very true. Stopped using trendlines a long time ago. I've seen it work for others but not for me. MAs are definitely more reliable as I know atleast someone must be looking at it, with me 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ I joined twitter only and only to learn and network with traders and investors. I used to hear in your videos "Jo mujhe Twitter pe follow karte hain..." and I thought to give it a try. This is really a great platform to learn from other's experiences and mistakes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RHInvestor I just know stocks...so it's big enough for me 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mitesh_Engr Isme arrogance wali kya baat hai ? Sahi to keh rahe hain Mitesh Bhai. Sabki tarah jo sochta hai, wo loss hi karega market mein. Log galti nikaalne pehle aa jaate hai, seekhna kuch nahin hai.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is sad ! Atleast veterans should be given some benefits by the government after using the best years of their lives. Lesson: Never, ever, rely on the government for anything. They are the most thankless and selfless entities on this planet. #respectveterans #SocialismKills<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan How to learn statistics and probability Sir ? Will it directly help us in trading for quant or are you recommending it just for psychology ? Any books etc. you would recommend ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only motive of doing a business should be to make profit. Period. #business #capitalism #profit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamGopalkapoor Yes it is Sir. But you would agree that an average middle class man in India has deposits of more than 5L in banks. My point is not that bank deposits are very risky. I just want to ensure that people stop classifying them as "risk free" instead of "low risk".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan 😂 I'm sure Aditya Puri won't even read these articles on Moneycontrol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why am I tweeting this ? To bust the myth (particularly prevalent in India) that bank deposits are the safest investment instruments. They definitely are 'low risk' instruments but not "risk free".  RT this to spread awareness 🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You should avoid small banks and corporate banks who promise higher interest rates on deposits. They have a higher chance of defaulting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In case of big private banks, the government will probably bail them out, given the fact that they are big enough. Why ? Bcoz if they are big enough and the bank defaults, it will affect the economy as many corporates, individuals and even governments rely on them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So how do you minimize this risk ? By depositing money to only public sector (government) banks and top private banks.   In case of government banks, you are actually lending to the government, hence the low risk. Will the government default, uhh...hmmm...I hope not 😐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is credit risk involved in bank deposits. Why ? Because the 'debt' you lend to bank in the name of "deposits" is collateral free i.e. the bank doesn't promise any asset in case of a default. (2/n)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bank deposits like FD, RD etc. is pure 'debt' given to the bank on which you get interest. There is risk involved with bank deposits unlike most Indians think. What is the risk ? (1/n)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Sir is LIQUIDBEES a good way to invest in debt instruments ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Great article. Pls do update in this thread for part 2 Sir 😊🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeingHorizontal 😂 Thank you Sir.... I thought it was the weed 😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your thoughts ? #gold #buffett #warrenbuffett<|endoftext|>

Why didn't Buffett just purchase gold like he bought silver ? Does he really believe in the gold story or is it the gold mining company he wants to specifically bet on ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is your definition of financial freedom ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kamath_nikhil Great thoughts Sir 😊 For me Financial Independence would be a state when I can do or not do, whatever I want, whenever I want, without having to worry about money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Ok Sir 😊 Got it. Thanks again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RetracementT Thanks Sir. This'll be a good screener for trend following strategies 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Sir in many tweets you said not to do it when you are a beginner. Like algo trading, averaging down, directional options, taking debt etc. When is the right time to know that we can now try these things ? How would you define a beginner or advanced trader ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Wow...no words Sir. You just covered everything for a beginner to avoid. I don't think there's anything more. I wish I knew this before I started, I would have save some time and money 😊 Thanks a lot Sir.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ipo_mantra Jai Hind ! Happy Independence Day Sir 😇<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Today, I stand up so high and  feel the  pride of being a part of the glorious nation India.   It‘s a big day for our country.   I wish you all the best Independence Day!  https://t.co/PPQeRVb1H4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kambhamsai Praying for his quick recovery 🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FI_InvestIndia Yes this is very true. Pls don't clone other investors. Recently read an article that RJ Sahab's portfolio lost 200cr. I can't imagine how many people must be cloning his portfolio. But I'm sure none of them would be hedging it which RJ must be doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FI_InvestIndia No ? I thought it's our responsibility as shareholders 😅<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aisha_wadhwa @paris1290 @VRtrendfollower Seems like it 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paris1290 @VRtrendfollower Which country are you from Sir ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1shankarsharma Waste ? This would make my weekend Sir 😊 Looking forward to it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FI_InvestIndia I also love attending concalls and enjoy the growth of my businesses 😊. Sir do you think it's important to attend AGMs or just online voting is enough ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderDivergent Yes. It'll definitely remove FOMO, revenge trading and overtrading. I'm working on this by taking trades only during the morning session.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TihoBrkan Totally agree. "Just Do It" that's my twitter header 😎 As Richard Branson said, “If somebody offers you an amazing opportunity but you are not sure you can do it, say yes – then learn how to do it later!”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vishvesh03 This is interesting. Thanks for pointing out Sir 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SunderjiJB Same like yesterday. Kal bhi aise hi tail bana tha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarangSood Pehle aise hota tha ? 🤔 What was the reason for switching Sir ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Exactly. Even God helps those who help themselves. Then how can we expect to give without doing good for ourselves first. I also aspire to be a philanthropist but before that need to make some money 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vineetpatawari Leveraging time using employees and technology is an important skill for an entrepreneur.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AryanMe77522265 @Abhishekkar_ Binod 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ The ability to give back to the society is a blessing. That is the true meaning of capitalism. Make a lot of money and then help others with your knowledge and wealth to achieve the same. 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Basically this is all there is to fundamental analysis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Thanks for sharing your losses in public Sir. Very few do it. Thanks for putting the reality of trading infront of everyone. Have a good weekend Sir 😊 #berealisitic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#trading #investing #stockmarket #technofunda #technicalanalysis #fundamentalanalysis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We should explore the pros and cons of both before jumping to conclusions as to which one is better.  Personally, I practice both as they are good in their own way.  Do share this thread to spread awareness. Would love to get your feedback, if you'd like to add something 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some people practice one of the two of the above methods. Both are profitable and scalable strategies and requires skill and efforts to apply and master.  Some like Bill Ackman, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala etc. practice both trading and investing as separate strategies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>-&gt; "Averaging" is used for entries and exits  Types : -&gt; Trading - trend following, momentum, reversal -&gt; Investing - Value, growth  Famous : -&gt; Traders - Jim Simons, Paul Tudor Jones, Jesse Livermore etc. -&gt; Investors - Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, Mohnish Pabrai etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>∆ INVESTING  -&gt; Based on value -&gt; Time frame - usually more than a year -&gt; Most investors use fundamental analysis -&gt; Accumulate in undervaluation and distribute in overvaluation -&gt; Requires relatively more research time -&gt; Investing is for building wealth (continued)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>∆ TRADING:   -&gt; Based on price -&gt; Time frame - few seconds to few months -&gt; Most traders use technical analysis.  -&gt; Ride winners, cut losers -&gt; Requires relatively more screen time -&gt; Trading is for income -&gt; "Scaling" is used for entries and exits<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trading Vs. Investing  This is an age old debate and people have their own biases. Since I like both, I'll try to present an unbiased view.   Rather than saying that one is better over the other let's look at the pros and cons of both worlds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True. Hard times are gone. Now it's time for everyone to get going !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adi2five Feeling honoured to be a part of your network Sir 😊 Learning a lot from you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How many salaried employees are in the Forbes richest list ?   Now think about it ? Do you really want to do a job to make money ?  Don't be an employee, be an employer ! #entrepreneurship #Entrepreneurs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderHarneet @TheLuckyIndian @velumania Thankyou Sir 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderHarneet @TheLuckyIndian @velumania Trading conferences kaha hote hai Sir ? Kaise jaate hai ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very true. There success can be probably attributed to the fact that they left India. If you really want to be proud on Indian success be proud of the Ambanis, Tatas, Adanis, Bajajs, Birlas etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reported a fake account of @Rayner_Teo who followed me. No one can replace Rayner 😊  https://t.co/D4JFe1vMHT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Airtel_Presence But the problem is not resolved. This is getting on my nerves now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ It's the part of the debt cycle which @RayDalio  talks about<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In order to intelligently use other people's money you should learn about debt and equity. All other forms of financing are a combination of debt and equity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>- #Equity is low risk but high #cost - If you take equity you are not obliged to pay (hence the low risk) but will be sharing your profits (hence the high cost)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>- #Debt is high #risk but low cost, - If you take debt you are obliged to pay (hence the high risk) a fixed percentage (hence the low cost)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two channels for using Other People's Money is : 1). #Debt 2). #Equity  Both have their own cost and risk with it and you should use a combination of both to optimize your cost and risk. #opm #leverage #Capitalism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FI_InvestIndia @AdeParimal @narendramodi What if they honestly file returns ? You should just snatch it, don't eat it 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do engineering colleges in India test the candidates knowledge in Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics to admit them into CS/IT ? #IITJEE #iit #engineering<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends @MariaBartiromo Looking at Trump's replies it always seems like he's gonna lose (same happened the last time) and ultimately he won. Seems like only the Democrats follow him and reply on his tweets 😂 How much do you guys get paid ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ @elearnmarkets can conduct/sponsor it 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FI_InvestIndia Ok Sir. Thanks for answering the question. But now you've made me curious 😁 How do you hedge without gold, real estate or F&amp;O ? Can you pls DM me if you don't want to discuss it in public ? 🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FI_InvestIndia I know you can't reply to all tweets Sir that's why I'm sharing this link  😊  https://t.co/ehWNIrtEFY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Sir kya Bloomberg se information edge milta hai ? Ya only insiders ke paas hi edge hota hai 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Before starting any task for the day, think if it will help you reach you #longterm #goal. If not, you should not do it. It'll only waste your #time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vaibhav_matere @FI_InvestIndia To reduce rent I guess<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ 😂 Got it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Eagerly waiting to hear how he made Binod% in Binod years 😇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Sir +7% ya +7 cr. 😁😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FI_InvestIndia Sirji do you invest in commodities like Gold etc. for hedging. If yes, then in which form ? Also, what is your view on real estate (residential/commercial/agricultural) ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SunderjiJB Sorry don't agree to you on this one Sir. IMO @realDonaldTrump is the better candidate for president. The case was different when Bloomberg was standing against him. US should always have a president who promote #capitalism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShyamanujSaikia @zerodhaonline Correct. Still it's good enough to practice without taking too much risk 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True #Capitalist is : 1). Uses Other People's Money 2). Uses Other People's Time 3). Generates Profit 4). Pays the expenses for 1 and 2 above 5). Keeps the rest, and 6). Repeats  People who understand and practice the above are the true #rich<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Airtel_Presence You said the same a week ago as well   https://t.co/sjAi5Y5emi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShyamanujSaikia @zerodhaonline Acha...that's good Bhai. Isliye hi to etf bane hai. Taaki apne jaise bhi index trade kar sake 😁😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShyamanujSaikia @zerodhaonline Etf for long term investing ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vivbajaj @reliancejio @JioCare @Airtel_Presence is no better. Same pathetic customer service protocols with no genuine intention to solve the problem. It's been 3 weeks now. Total waste of time and money.  https://t.co/6gIvNeG6ZW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OneAmongU @Dinesh_Sairam They are obliged to respond to shareholder queries according to Companies Act, 2013.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AnyBodyCanFly Sir this is in rupees or dollars ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jaylal55 Ok Sir 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jaylal55 What would have been excellent result Sir ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnyBodyCanFly Sir how are you estimating EPS ? Is it your personal method or is their some source to learn it ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adi2five @SrBachchan @taapsee Got it Sir. Thanks 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adi2five @SrBachchan @taapsee Jo jaisa dikhta hai waisa hota nahin hai. Sir do you look for accounting anomalies in an AR ? If yes, how can we learn it ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vivek_Investor So much value is being given by many twitter handles, still people want spoon feeding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ It's because people who can't handle one job just can't believe how entrepreneurs like Elon manage multiple multi billion dollar businesses. It's all about leveraging time 😊 @SEBI_India  can't regulate that 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShyamanujSaikia Yes our setup should be as mechanical as possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderHarneet Sirji after cash, do you recommend futures or options ?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@adi2five Sir do you prefer to read annual reports in pdf format or hard form ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OshoInvesting There is something called personal bankruptcy as well. If you declare it, legally no creditor can trouble you for returning their money ...the court will ensure it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anilbalaji11 Looks like a scam Sir. He can file an FIR and/or declare bankruptcy. Borrowing again is not smart. When his relatives and friends are not helping, you also shouldn't Sir. Maybe they know that he won't return or it's just emotional tactic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amol3945 @unseenvalue Anyone can tune into concalls. You'll also get recordings on YouTube etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderHarneet Well said Sir. Passion is everything. And for whoever is trolling - All billionaires are passionate but all passionate people are not billionaires.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderHarneet @Trendmyfriends Ok...Thankyou Sir 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderHarneet @Trendmyfriends Yes. It actually did. During march it went down 40%. I'd considered this in the beginning and I wanted to keep it concentrated. But now I think it'll better to diversify. How many stocks would you recommend for a 1L portfolio Sir ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderHarneet @Trendmyfriends Yes Sir...but my capital was too small for diversification.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderHarneet @Trendmyfriends I started trading in November and after losing 10% of my capital, realised that I don't have a strategy and this would only blow my account. So I stopped trading and invested in one stock in January. Now after 7 months, my portfolio is doubled 😇 Sometimes not trading is the ans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rishikesh_ADX Holding from 300 😇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vineetpatawari @mystockedge This a great feature for techno-funda trading 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderDivergent 😁 Great analogy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan It was from Rakeshji that I learned that targets are not feasible and I started using a trailing SL for trend following.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tejaskhoday @ShubikaOberoi Intent is definitely good Sir but they should consider taking the opinion of industry experts before taking sudden independent decisions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShubikaOberoi @tejaskhoday Bad news I guess 😬<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Nithin0dha Back to normal but seems extraordinary 😇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Personally I feel that it's financial suicide. But for some, a home is a dream and a loan is a smart way to facilitate that in certain cases. But it should only be taken in a smart way (The banks will ensure that 😁)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FI_InvestIndia That is what differentiates a true investor from a punter 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Agreed. Anyways they have to build and maintain their brand presence. SM is a necessary evil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anand_luhar @onlyequities 😂 Perfect example<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Most of their hatred is a by product of jealousy etc. People just can't digest how these people have achieved more than them and they pound upon the first opportunity to defame and spread hatred about them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RetracementT @airtelindia @Airtel_Presence Will do it if this is not resolved soon.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AnyBodyCanFly Sir what is your view on Bajaj Consumer ? The stock seems to be irrationally down for the past 3 years inspite of conservative fundamentals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anitabansal0 What was your reason for exiting Bajaj Consumer Sir ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vivek_Investor Sir what are your views on Bajaj Consumer ? It looks fundamentally good to me but the price has been down for almost 3 years.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ I once read in a body language book that TV anchors in USA are made to wear skirts so that people don't pay attention bro what they are saying. That's the harsh truth and Indian media especially the business ones have been quick to deploy this strategy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CRevanth92 @Jakerachoudhury Tastytrade and optionalpha are the best for learning options trading.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ShyamanujSaikia Ha Bhai dekh liya. Mujhe nahin pata tha 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShyamanujSaikia 😂 Pehli baar suna is company ke baare mein. Ab iske baare mein pata lagana padega.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very true. Be one of these 👇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan How can I confirm if I'm in this state ? This would be nice to count screen time infront of charts. 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderDivergent Thanks Alen. Got it 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SunderjiJB How will you define a retail trader ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RetracementT Thankyou Sir 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Similarly, should I trade a breakout from the structure if a price reversal happens after the formation of a continuation pattern or vice-versa ? @vivbajaj @Mitesh_Engr @123chetanp @ST_PYI @Abhishekkar_ @PAVLeader  @TraderHarneet  @Rishikesh_ADX @RetracementT @Rayner_Teo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of those patterns in the first place. Eg : a descending triangle is a bearish pattern(according to textbooks) but if price breaks above the down trendline of the triangle, should we take a long trade considering that it could be just be a trendline break ? (2/n)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can any of you pls answer this question ? When trading price action using chart patterns, should we stick to the textbook rules to the word or can we tweak them as per our requirements. I'm afraid if I do so, it'll negate the initial psychological reasons for the formation  (1/n)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nithin0dha I thought that SEBI was created to protect retail traders. Why is it taking irrational decisions which could disrupt the markets ? @nsitharaman @PiyushGoyal @SEBI_India @NSEIndia @BSEIndia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Sir what is going on with sebi ? Sebi mein bhi operator ghus gaya kya ? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdityaTodmal @yashstocks @Mitesh_Engr Hehe...sir has given the answer. It's 170<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wise__Trader #wisetraderarmy Yaha bhi apne proof bhej deejiye 🙏  https://t.co/yHpqGGZ8m8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NI71N @Abhishekkar_ @vivbajaj I didn't know that. Thankyou 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChutiyaJitin @somraj_t @Abhishekkar_ @vivbajaj Yes of course. That's allowed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NI71N @Abhishekkar_ @vivbajaj Exactly Sir. It's a service they are offering and it's totally our choice if we want to buy it or not. The seller cannot be held responsible for unsatisfactory service/product. This is what the law says 🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@somraj_t @Abhishekkar_ @vivbajaj Uhh..no Sir. I won't. It is my responsibility if I buy fair&amp;lovely,Maggi(for 2 min),McDowell music CD,rajnigandha(for success), etc. just by believing their advertisement. Everyone knows it's false Sir but it's legally allowed to a extent. There's nothing much we can do about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ravindergarg67 Thanks a lot Sir. Will surely remember your wise words 😇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ @vivbajaj If anybody charges for a service and people don't like it then they say it's a scam. People should do their due diligence before paying for any product/service etc. and if you do then it's your risk. Remember, Indian law follows "Caveat Emptor".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vivbajaj @123chetanp sir's videos were also very good. We would love to see more videos from him 🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FinTaxCA_01 @Abhishekkar_ Sorry I don't invest in mutual funds so I'll take your word 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vivbajaj That's a good decision. Pls take interviews of traders of your prop firm Sir 🙏 It would be great to listen to the perspective of professional commodity traders 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ The only person who gets rich from a mutual fund is.......... the fund manager. "Mutual funds sahi nahin hai". Better to invest in an index fund, learn how to invest or even a hedge fund if you have the means.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vijaykumar_alur @AnyBodyCanFly Thankyou Sir 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@there_is_roy @AnyBodyCanFly Wish you the same Bhai. Thanks 😊<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RHirakud Hats off to our forces ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ravindergarg67 @AnyBodyCanFly I share your same view Sir 😊 But I tweeted this to keep myself accountable to my goals.Warren Buffett once said to his teacher,"I'll become a millionaire by 30 or I'll jump from the highest building of Omaha" 😁 I'm sure he didn't mean it but declaring goals is sometimes helpful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BakulThummar @AnyBodyCanFly 😇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mdnkmr @AnyBodyCanFly Thanks a lot Sir. Wish you the same 😊<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DRSUNILPATIL @AnyBodyCanFly 😊 Thankyou Sir<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheLuckyIndian @contrarianEPS Since you mention "trader", there are two ways for you to exit. You can either use a trailing SL or you can use a price target. Since there are many ways you can do these, you should search how to do them online and choose an exit strategy which suits you best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FI_InvestIndia Sir should we be adding to our holdings even if the company is fairvalued/overvalued at the time or should we be booking profits at that time ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderDivergent Very true. Prepare for the worst and pray for the best. A similar analogy would be for insurance and hedging 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbhinuMannadath @AnyBodyCanFly Really appreciate your wishes Sir. I'm sure you'll also achieve your goals 😊👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vaibhav_matere @AnyBodyCanFly Thank you Sir...Wish you the same for your goals as well 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnyBodyCanFly I'll be a millionaire by 30 for sure. I'm 20 rn and I'll show this tweet to everyone once I reach my goal. 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vivbajaj Totally agree Sir. It's better for retailers to swim with the sharks rather than try to fight them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vivbajaj Discount brokers love to say that retailers are now driving the market 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tradepanda1 @TraderHarneet Agreed...our total capital should be divided into different strategies and timeframes like intraday, swing, positional and investing depending on personal risk appetite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Thankyou Sir 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@architpatel1 @Abhishekkar_ I'm no expert Sir but what I do is let my position size decide. Eg: If my position size requires me to trade 500 qty and if one fut. lot is of 400 qty, I buy one fut. lot and 100 qty in cash.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theBuoyantMan Very true Sir... The best of the best never share their secrets. That's why they are the best. Still waiting for your course on running a business in India Sir 😊<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Watching a 28 hour long playlist on options. Will complete it by tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FI_InvestIndia Hehe...love it when you talk like a guru. 😁 Thankyou Sir !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@safalniveshak This perception that commerce and humanities is easy has to change. I did science in class 12, have studied graduation level BA and now doing CA. Trust me....commerce and arts is tough. Stop looking down on other streams and try doing it yourself. Teacher pakka science wali hogi.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FI_InvestIndia Ok Sir 😊 We should ignore the next 12 months because of the present conditions or should we do it every time ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FI_InvestIndia Sir how to find future earnings growth ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People lose money by trading in the markets and then say that it's a casino. Rather #mumbikernikhil should encourage investing. I'm also a beginner but I'm sure that the real pros also have the same view @Abhishekkar_ @FI_InvestIndia @AnyBodyCanFly @Rishikesh_ADX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Recently seeing a lot of influencers endorsing #groww app. But I was disappointed by @emNikhil for promoting trading by claiming that he's been trading for the past 2 years. Not the way to go Sir. Encouraging beginners to start trading is dangerous. (1/2)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RetracementT Yes... I agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Must read....routines do make a difference !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RetracementT Sir you can backtest your strategies on tradingview and zerodha pi. I think it's possible on amibroker as well. We just need to code the strategy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FundamentalGems That's why we should always trail our stops 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RetracementT But Sir what if we automate it ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True...as hell. No offense 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Bas... Ye to mein araam se loan leke de doonga. Saath mein aapko complimentary promissory note bhi de doonga 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RetracementT That's interesting 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Absolutely Sir... We believe in your credibility. No need to prove anything to anyone. We are learning a lot from you anyways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BanwaleBhai @Abhishekkar_ I think he probably deploys it automatically only... so it doesn't matter. Backtesting becomes more important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ @SarmahBikrant Yes R is better for testing statistics based strategies. Disclaimer: I'm a CA student 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vivbajaj @elearnmarkets deserves more. You are really filling the gap between retail and professional. Thanks a lot Sir for your initiative 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes...this would be great. Please consider this @NSEIndia. Especially for smallcaps. Hedging smallcaps with nifty 50 doesn't work due to less correlation.  #NSE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ That's why I don't have targets 😊 I just trail my stop loss or exit on resistance/support levels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FI_InvestIndia Would love to but I was fully invested before march 😁 Crash wasted !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A very subtle difference. Noted !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RetracementT I was saving "ideal setups" but never looked at the "poor setups". Thanks, I'll do this from today 😊<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RetracementT Been focussing on only one strategy and trying to improve it for the past one year. Sir I'm an intraday trader, will you suggest me to try swing trading also ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderHarneet You forgot trading psychology videos 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Why is everyone saying that Ambani ji is not self made ? Doesn't almost everyone in India inherit their ancestral wealth ?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ How to win friends itni moti kaise hai ? Mere pass to patli waali hai.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@vivbajaj @suru27 Can't wait till next Friday. Looking forward to this video 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cawaalaladka @neerajarora91 If you have time to devote you should learn trading. You'll make more money. Long term investing is overrated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@moneytalkstrad1 @SJosephBurns @CNBC We also have a mixed economy in India and we are slowly moving towards capitalism. Socialism has done more damage than good for our country and that's why people are trying to be capitalistic now. Better late than never.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SJosephBurns @CNBC I'm from India and I look up to America as the symbol of capitalism. A request to the American citizens, please do not support socialists 🙏 We don't want another Russia #capitalism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Americans don't have a habit of saving like we Indians do, that's why their personal finance situation is really poor. Indians already love real estate and precious metals. We only need to explore the equity market and then there's no stopping us 🤘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keshav_trader @stockifi_Invest Sahi baat hai 😁 Paisa hone se kuch nahin hota use badhana bhi aana chahiye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stockifi_Invest "The amount needed to end poverty" that's a myth. The harsh truth is that the lack of money for the poor was never the cause for poverty. I don't think giving the poor money is the solution to poverty and that too from the pockets of the rich ? I strongly disagree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ipo_mantra I think it's volatility. Most people can't bear the feeling of seeing their portfolios go red after a green year and they start feeling that they have lost both the gains and the losses. That's why they prefer fixed income instruments like FD, RD, jobs etc. over the markets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woah...that's eye opening. I knew most of it was fake but never knew it was planned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderDivergent Alan, do you have some advice for me ? I exit my day trades on pullbacks and miss out on the big moves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Thanks for sharing your losses Sir 😊 Can you pls share your reason for shorting indusind ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Einstein one was best 😂 Tried doing that but I was blessed with a slower brain so had to go with a simple strategy. 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Singh7575 Yes...profit factor is a very important metric to analyze our strategy. (Average of X/Average of Y) is also very important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aquariantrader Congratulations Sir....and thank you for being there for us. You have inspired my trading a lot Sir.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sadab1819 @aquariantrader Yes..I didn't notice that. Thanks 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very important lesson taught by @Abhishekkar_  Sir...to avoid companies with pledged shares of promoters. He said that 30% pledging is acceptable but I'll prefer zero or negligible levels. Don't be a "khatron ka khiladi" !! Thankyou Sir 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aquariantrader 10750 is Monthly R1 level.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm not a father right now(Don't expect being one in the near future 😂) but I'll definitely remember this for parenting !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FI_InvestIndia Very very true Sir. Thanks 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InvesysCapital Why is it wrong to charge for something ? Dancing etc. is his skill which he has developed and that's his bread and butter. Then why do you expect him to do it for free ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Giving back to the society" is a concept which was developed and is endorsed by people who expect something from the society ! #earnit #capitalism #workforit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FI_InvestIndia Sir should we analyze this for all stocks or is it only for the ones which we are buying for dividend ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarketsFloor Sorry I couldn't the wicks didn't load so I thought it's something else 😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarketsFloor Sir why don't you use candlesticks ? Is there a specific reason ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is a difference b/w the poor and the needy. Giving money to the poor is like pouring water into sand, it will vanish and get wasted. Giving money to the needy is like giving water to a plant, it will grow and be fruitful. #givetotheneedy #dontwastemoney #capitalism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@niftywizard Very beautiful Sir 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnyBodyCanFly Really appreciate your honesty for declaring your vested interests Sir. Your handle has added a lot of value for me. Would love to be your mentee one day 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderDivergent Thanks...I'll definitely check it out 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trendmyfriends @anand_luhar This is Mayhem !! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ST_PYI Thanks a lot Sir 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trendmyfriends 😂 Exactly !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderHarneet Identifying regions of least risk (for entry) and path of least resistance (for direction and exit) is all what is required for trading. IMO no one can predict the market.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@123chetanp How are you making this sheet and analyzing it Sir ? I would like to learn 🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderDivergent I know there are easy alternatives but I'm serious about algo trading and would like to explore as much as I can. I would love to see how quantitative analysis and data science works in the markets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ST_PYI Sir I was watching your intraday playlist and I had a question. When you say to check Advance/Decline, do you mean 1).Advance/Decline data on NSE, 2).Advance/Decline line or 3). Advance/Decline ratio ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderDivergent Yes I'm working on it. Learning python to automate my trades 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderDivergent Haha... true. But my strategy needs to trail my stoploss 🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SJosephBurns Wow...this is gold. @LindaRaschke is a great trader and her rules make perfect sense. 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NileshTrader Why are you quitting algo trading Sir ? Is it not profitable ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stockifi_Invest No...that's incredible 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A very valuable lesson especially for stock investors. Buy them when they go on sale.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Thanks a lot Sir...love to see these kinds of threads from you 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderDivergent The cleaner the charts, the better the decisions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnyBodyCanFly 7 and 8 is weird<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FI_InvestIndia Being convinced of our holdings is very important. I'm a beginner in the markets and made my first investment in January as I thought the company was undervalued. It was my faith in the business which helped me to hold on even after a 47% drop after buying 😊 Trust the business !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Wow...that's interesting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FI_InvestIndia It doesn't matter who does it and for what reasons, as long as it is good for people, I'm with them 😊 If they can come up with an Ayurvedic treatment, it's the best 👍<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mitesh_Engr $10000 ka course bechte hai aur kehte hai dil bada hai 😁 Yaha Mitesh Bhai free mein sikha raha hain sirf charts ke screenshot se. Course bechne walo ki sirf m2m hi dikhta hai 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mitesh_Engr Kuch logo ka dil itna bada hota hai ki wo apne videos pe blonde ladkiyon ka thumbnail lagate hai. Aur like dislike bhi disable karte hain. Humari stock market inke waje se hi to chalti hai 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ Mark his words "An average person". Proper tax planning can save a lot of taxes. And I'm not talking about 'tax evasion'. Talk to a CA or a lawyer and you'll be amazed by the number of ways by which you can "save" tax. It's totally legal 😊 That's the best part. Seek advice !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@poojamalhotra21 Ek baar suna tha, uske baad gaano se bharosa uth gaya 😂😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TraderHarneet Well said Sir...I'm sticking this on my wall 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CrystalWaves7 I've got Rs.100 ? Need to invest it wisely. I'll have Munger and Cuban (For Rs.20, this is value for money 😉) and I'll have Elon and Gary for Rs. 30 each. Let me see, I've a VC, an entrepreneur, a digital marketer and Munger. Best ever use of Rs.100 😁<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@onlyequities Sir are they SD bands of VWAP ? Which platform is it ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Better to realize this early !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AstikSharma1729 Nice hashtag Bhai 😁🤘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderHarneet I used to make this mistake of going big on a single trade. I think the better way is to diversify our positions and taking small risks on a particular stock.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ May his soul RIP 😔 Thanks to traders like @Abhishekkar_ and others who are showing their losses and trying to show the real world of trading. Thanks for keeping our eyes open and keeping us grounded at all times. #tradingisnotgambling #berealistic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnyBodyCanFly Isn't PUBG Chinese ? It should also be banned. #banpubg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderDivergent Yeahh...recording me talk to myself would be the best way to study my emotions. 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saw this YouTube comment. Never really thought like this. Need to do something about this. #education #school #college #degree  https://t.co/rXr2DST4Yk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JaswantAditya @ST_PYI Sir can I track only 2 stocks and use a trending strategy and a range-bound strategy on them ? Is it advisable ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaswantAditya @ST_PYI Thanks... I'll try that 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dedicated to audible users !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alpha2Sigma It's a rising wedge after a downtrend...so it's bearish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@p_viren @ST_PYI Yes...earlier I used to stick to only 2 stocks and had to wait for many days for my setup. I think stock selection from a index like Nifty 50 is a good balance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ST_PYI Sir is it better to stick to the same 1-2 stocks or actively select stocks everyday for trading ?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Indiabullscare @tweeter_vikram @Abhishekkar_ 😂😂 Ye kya hua ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rajitr I'm sure I'm gonna forget it...so you can keep an eye on the Forbes list and contact me when I'm there 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stocktalk_in This is like going to a robber's den and blaming the robber's for robbing them. Not that operators are robbers but blaming them for your mistakes is stupid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bhavik_modh_ This can be related to trusting the management when the stock is going through a bad time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@saichowdary543 @ST_PYI ATR is best for volatility. Most of the volatility based indicators are derived from ATR.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@myRLinvestments @ST_PYI Do you watch NoNonsenseForex ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ST_PYI @Invbhav Eagerly waiting for it 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rajitr If you are so worried about wealth, why don't you earn it rather than complaining about inequality ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FI_InvestIndia Well said Sir...I think Balance Sheet and Cashflow is anytime more important. P/L is complimentary to these statements.(Note: I'm a beginner, pls correct me if I'm wrong 😊🙏)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onlyequities @Abhishekkar_ ne bola tha aaj ke podcast mein<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amazing lesson to learn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FI_InvestIndia Very true....my family had asked if I wanted to go abroad for studies and career and this is what I tell them, "Jo bhi karna hai yahin karoonga 😊" Long live India 🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piyushmodi1 @KPTheTrader @TIrth360 Whichever timeframe you are trading on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piyushmodi1 @Mitesh_Engr Best indicator to trail is ATR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ghelanii @Arunstockguru This is called reading between the lines. 😊👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great compilation by @Abhishekkar_  Sir !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mukeshchauhan @Abhishekkar_ Absolutely !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why I use social media - "To learn from others" !! Reading books by people from your field, is the best way to learn from their lives in a matter of a few pages #Reading #books #LearningNeverStops<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is exactly how I react 😂 @Abhishekkar_<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ I read the full thread,is umeed mein ki koi to kuch acha sa reason dega ki grahan ke time khaana kyu nahin khaana chahiye. Mujhe abhi tak uska jawaab to nahin mila,lekin ye seekh liya ki ek rational person ki tarah,maturely reply kaise karte hai.Thankyou Abhishek Sir 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't argue with that !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Marry your strategy folks. Don't cheat on it !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Both are interrelated. If you manage your risk and control your emotion, you will stay in the game for the long run and if you do, this will happen 👇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This makes all the difference in trading !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justhiru @Rishikesh_ADX Yeah...that makes sense. Thanks 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rishikesh_ADX Sir why do you use the 75min chart ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhishekkar_ 😂😂😂 Hats off !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rishikesh_ADX Well said Sir.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnyBodyCanFly Thanks a lot Sir. Waiting for that list 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vivbajaj Sir I'm thankful for whatever you are doing for us. I can't express how much value you have added to my learning and led me closer to my goal of becoming a professional trader/investor. Please keep doing the amazing work you've been doing Sir 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CAPratik_INDIAN I believe the market has given every trader a limited number of stop losses to learn from. Every single SL you take today is one less for the future. The best trading lessons are taught by our losses. Profits add money and losses add experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FI_InvestIndia Coming from a defence background I know what it feels like to be in a war situation. Trust me, they are trained for war but they never want war.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kulchidambar @Abhishekkar_ Just forget about it. Treat it as if you have bought a piece of real estate and don't track the stock's price on a daily or weekly basis. Learnt it from the great Warren Buffett 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FI_InvestIndia The media loves to debate on the death or problems of celebrities and the mass loves to watch it just because they have seen their movies. More than the deaths of celebrities people should worry about the recent martyrdom of soldiers on the Chinese border. Did you see that on TV?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rishikesh_ADX @ash_lodha I've been holding this stock for the past 6 months based on pure fundamentals. It's an undervalued company in an undervalued sector with high growth potential<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnyBodyCanFly Yes.. we should study other companies in the sector, preferably competitors, of the companies we are holding to get a wider view of the sector and understand the weaknesses and threats to our companies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mitesh_Engr Google translate to ye dikha raha hai   "What happened to the clouds ? Someone remembered the "jam" So someone's "name"...!! "  Thankyou Google a lot 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rishikesh_ADX @Rayner_Teo Yes a trading journal is very important to analyze our performance while trading. Thanks a lot 😊<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Tushar_fin @vivbajaj Yes it was a great video by @Mitesh_Engr on how to trade simple setups like range breakouts. Ek video ne fan bana diya 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mazhar06711078 @Abhishekkar_ Same here...still working on my strategy. No hurries ! 😊<|endoftext|>
