<|startoftext|>@AJBecklesVO "Dubs suck subs are better!"   But friend the reason why you have easily accessible and well translated subs is due to dubbing you'd all still be passing around fan translations of FMA at dragon con if it wasn't for the dub<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>for context Kim has been editing audio books about the 14th amendment and absolutely called this would happen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melinda6827 @CNN I mean they already are they're called the police *ba dum tiss*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melinda6827 @CNN we're confusing too many issues here, regardless of my Christian faith a country as proven racist as America should not be putting people to death. I mean this man was treated man harshly than Dylan Roof a (white) mass murderer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melinda6827 @CNN Yeah and God said we can seek forgiveness for our crimes in this world. This why we bother to repent. These jurors and the prosecuting attorney are just as much murderers as Bernard was and they sought to rectify that for themselves but people like you need a pound of flesh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melinda6827 @CNN No Sara the bible doesn't say murderers get off if the person they murdered is guilty it says all murderers go to hell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melinda6827 @CNN If you believe in that then people who murder murderers are no exception to this rule Sara God didn't make a special pardon for that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melinda6827 @CNN You're making the horrible assumption that the prison, legal and justice system is fair in this Country which we have proven this year isn't true. So why should a broken system be sending people to death?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melinda6827 @CNN And what about the central park 5? If the state had their way 5 innocent men could have been put to death. We've seen tons of execution cases in this country where exonerating evidence is found after the state has flipped the switch and all we can say is oops<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melinda6827 @CNN The only difference between you and Bernard is that you let the state do the killing for you so you can feel good. This whole case is tragedy. This man could have risen above his sins but you believe that's impossible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melinda6827 @CNN And people are still being murdered Sara murders are still being committed. People clearly don't have the fact that they may die by the state on their minds when murdering so what since does a 2 million dollar tax payer education actually do? Other than slate your bloodlust<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melinda6827 @CNN You think he should die because they are dead. It's not enough for you that he'd spend the rest of life in jail and you keep making up hypothetical crimes he could've committed in jail (but didn't) all just to say you think killing him is right you think eye for an eye is okay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melinda6827 @CNN so you admit it! You want revenge not justice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melinda6827 @CNN Sara you are at this point either not reading what I'm typing or purposely miss repeating my words. He could have been kept from the general prison population if he was believed to be a danger to other inmates he did not have to die at the state's hands<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melinda6827 @CNN But death is inevitable Sara it's not punishment it's something that will happen to all of us one day. They could have kept him locked away till he died naturally but instead he was put down like a dog. Instead of two dead people in this case there are now three<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melinda6827 @CNN They could have pushed for him to be kept form general prison population this isn't hard Sara you just think state sanctioned killings are cool as long as the other person is "bad beyond saving" something that can only be proved by continuous action<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melinda6827 @CNN Here's a bold take you're not gonna like: even if he was he still deserved to live. He deserved to spend the rest of his natural life in prison reflecting on those crimes as a thinking living human man. In killing him you freed him of any responsibility in life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melinda6827 @CNN His prosecuting attorney sara the person who picked the death penalty initially advocated for this man not to die what could you possibly know more about in this case to say putting this man to death was the right choice? I am genuinely curious?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melinda6827 @CNN and how do you know Bernard was one of those people? What proof do you have that proves Bernard was without doubt a psychopath with no remorse that his prosecuting attorney was not aware of when advocating for him to not be put to death?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melinda6827 @CNN And I mean you just said you fine with execution if Bernard killed another inmate (again we executed this man cause he potentially could be faking being regretful and there was no other to figure this out) he could potentially be killing another murderer so what's the difference<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melinda6827 @CNN you think an eye for an eye is a good justice system. You believe in vengeance over justice. You think the state should carry out murders for people you deem "blood thirsty" and "sadistic"  instead of them being simply kept away from society or rehabilitated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melinda6827 @CNN but did he kill and attack other prisoners and guards? He didn't. In fact he was described as model prisoner. Just say you think an eye for an eye is good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melinda6827 @CNN so because he might have been faking his regret for his crimes so he could possibly fight a parole board for at least another 5 years so he could be freed where he would then commit more hypothetical murders he should die? That is what you're saying?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melinda6827 @CNN It if he's a killer what does that make the state who put him to death? He was away from society in jail unable to harm anyone else. No one was begging for him to be released just that he wasn't put down like animal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am new to the pronoun joke please tell me what does me including my pronouns say about me as a person?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@melinda6827 @CNN This man's last words are in this article. If you read them and truly think his life deserved to be snuffed out by country that drinks black people's blood for every meal then you're beyond saving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melinda6827 @CNN And what did killing him accomplish? Did the couple come back to life? Did this man who's last words of reflection and peace mean nothing? This man could have used his wisdom to help prevent more murders by doing outreach! how does another dead body improve our society?<|endoftext|>

Imagine make a choice like that 20 years ago learning new info that informs your choice and begging the state to reconsider and they say "no" no human should have to live with that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melinda6827 @CNN you're conveniently leaving out how the prosecuting attorney and the Jurors in Bernards case also advocated for him not being put to death and wished they'd picked a lighter sentence initially what good is a justice system that doesn't push for change and rehabilitation<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarianneDHobbit Nah man I'm spent. I legit don't have ot in me what ever i do have is taken by customers i help and the vaccine isn't going to end the lockdown. I'm really tired fam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not mention being worried about my performance in my role and i am just loosing it guys really am. It's getting harder and harder to drag myself out of bed every morning. Speaking of which it's 25 minutes to my shift so I better go. Good luck y'all stay safe and survive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am honestly not certain how long i can keep holding out. It feels like buying things and arguing with people on twitter is the only way I experience emotions otherwise I'm constantly numb to the horror stories I'm hearing cause if i wasn't I'd just start screaming<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not to mention my job at this point is talking to people who've lost like everything in the pandemic so i have the constant hanging reminder of how not having a job right now is far worse than having a job you feel obligated to maintain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like i had to wake up early for a meeting at 9 am (my shift is at 2:30 pm) and it was only an hour and went back to sleep and I am waking up to go right back to work. I feel institutionalized in my own apartment. This feels like psychological torture<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like as a leftist yes "capitalism hell" but like real talk I'm getting depressed as fuck experiencing the exact same day over and over again. I'm emotionally spent, i barely have energy to create, and all it feels like i do is work eat and sleep while saying dumb things on here<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@paclemmo @john_wice @wfaa but now that we're in lockdown limbo you're suddenly concerned about the isolation? If you want to end this encourage your fellow plague rats to ya know stop ignoring it listen when the news says there are 6 ICU beds left and act like you and your family might not get one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paclemmo @john_wice @wfaa You arguing this point shows you clearly don't respect the CDC guidelines and who knows how many poor people you've infected with your flippant attitude the CDC said even one month of a successful lockdown could get the spread on control but y'all would not go for it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paclemmo @john_wice @wfaa the lock down would have been shorter if the spread was managed instead we all had a very fun Memorial day holiday and the Baylor health care system was at capcity two weeks later and that's where we've been since<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paclemmo @john_wice @wfaa they didn't avoid it but like they aren't having a 9/11 death rate each day and you know I just think it'd be real cool if our fellow Americans weren't dropping like flies but that's just me I care about my neighbors or some stupid bs like that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paclemmo @john_wice @wfaa funny you guys go for Venezuela and never like Germany, France, Canada, or Japan I'm sure that's not in bad faith or anything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paclemmo @john_wice @wfaa and all we asked is the government do a little more of what it was already designed to do, take care of us make sure we have a safe future for our children, cause that's the exchange of being governed you see we put people in charge of making decisions for our benefit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paclemmo @john_wice @wfaa however as long as you are driving on state and tax payer funded roads, with your car negotiated in a trade deal for you to buy at a fair price, to your local grocer where all your food has been examined by the FDA for safe consumption you are being taken care of by government<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paclemmo @john_wice @wfaa If you want to go live somewhere where the government does absolutely nothing to take care of it's people, that place is called the wilderness we left there some hundred thousand years ago to form a society where we take care of each other, go knock yourself out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paclemmo @john_wice @wfaa sir do you know what 'Govern' means? The problem here is fundamental disconnect on what it means to well lead, and guess what good Leaders do take care of the people that follow them. Jesus didn't just throw two fish at the ground and say "Alright figure it out!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paclemmo @john_wice @wfaa But if you want more specifics joel how about you take a lovely drive down 35 to the Dallas health department and ask the super nice civil servants who keep us safe from other diseases not just rona why for the first part of the pandemic was spent with them not having PPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paclemmo @john_wice @wfaa Idk man ask New Zealand and Thailand but obviously just "wait it out" ain't working. The T man said this would be a memory by now but it's a living nightmare. Yet Texas still negotiated to get the vaccine here early so either the virus is a problem or it ain't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Why aren't you talking about the advance medical treatment they are doing while still running out of ICU beds for people who also potentially need that treatment?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paclemmo @john_wice @wfaa Hi Joel i live in an apartment in Denton County and yesterday night watched one of my neighbors be hauled away in ambulance due to repository arrest.

<|startoftext|>@Monyriz90 @wfaa I mean the people who pay into the system are the people who need help so it's taxpayer money helping taxpayers which is more than I can say for billionaires who notably use loopholes so they don't pay taxes why wouldn't we spend taxpayer money on tax payers?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@toddlerhr @DiscoHair1 @RevDrBarber @chrislhayes Idk why atheists tend to think all religious people only make a choice if a pastor or God tells them to but it's very backwards and not fair to religions outside of the US cult of Christianity.

<|startoftext|>@toddlerhr @DiscoHair1 @RevDrBarber @chrislhayes My guy pastors are only leaders to people of their flock people with faith take this man as an authority.

<|startoftext|>@2ATamara @EpplerGregg @wfaa so let me get this straight if the government provides funding to public healthcare institutions then the government also has the right to blackmail said institutions into not providing certain procedures even if they could be life saving?

<|startoftext|>@EpplerGregg @jayceelovi @wfaa the main way pp actually prevents abortions is through education and birth control which all also get struck down.

<|startoftext|>@EpplerGregg @jayceelovi @wfaa If pp stops offering abortions that just means poor people can't get them (safely) rich and middle class people could get them from their private doctors why should only poor people be subjected to government over reaching?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@toddlerhr @DiscoHair1 @RevDrBarber @chrislhayes I mean it's social media and you actively curate your experiences on this app if you hate religious posts why give them the interactions?

<|startoftext|>@RealDJCthulhu @sextoyspolitics Oh God i forgot about atypical<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>hey if a you call for bunch of Autistic talent and then pick a neurotypical and accuse them of being bad actors it's 100 percent cause you were expecting those actors to be playing a version of autism that exists in your mind not their ACTUAL experiences<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Handy dandy checklist  #leftist #vegans  -it ignores cultures that have raising meat sustainably for generations - it's dangerous to people who can't absorb protein from plant based foods -people making 2 dollars a day to pick our veggies isn't ethical<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can not stress to #leftisttwitter enough how abelist and racist it is to push "go vegan to save the world" and you should be pushing for ethical and sustainable food sourcing as a green platform not just the dietary lifestyle that gives you a sense of superiority<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BannedTofuWiz @DavidNayfeld @SenSanders This is actually also sort of false as switching vegan wouldn't end unethical factoryfarming it would simply take meat out of the equation and it wouldn't help cultures that have been sustainably raising meat or people with dietary restrictions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hearing of Kirby Morrow's passing feels especially painful given the excitement we were all feeling the week prior for the return of the original dub actors for yashahime. Maruko is a beloved character from childhood and I'd delight in hearing Kirby's voice in other projects<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes I look through terrible KyloRenxRey takes just to feel something anymore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshuadavdking Yeah while personally i think west coast anime committing to union talent is really cool it does bring up now that new actors need an easier path to the Union to get their start but I'd never say I'm anti workers rights there's nuance to these convos why do people not get this<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Frostburnt @TravisGarber5 @TinderS9 @NBCDFW also can't stress enough Texas educators do not have union it's actually a pretty big problem why did this person even bring unions up?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TravisGarber5 @TinderS9 @NBCDFW the teacher's don't a have union at all. Texas is a right to work state why did you bring unions into this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@3Dboxingblog @elicarmona86 @wfaa If this were Egypt you'd be arguing the effectiveness of putting lamb's blood on your door, so don't bring God into it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@3Dboxingblog @elicarmona86 @wfaa How do you even mention God when you're so selfish you wouldn't wear a mask to protect your community? Even if it didn't protect you you could be protecting others people weaker than you people less fortunate you talk religion but you're Godless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@3Dboxingblog @elicarmona86 @wfaa we are done cause now you're lying. You provided one article that I refuted and vaguely gestured to the others providing no links or photographic evidence to these claims. I'm religiously addicted to looking out for my fellow man cause I practice kindness not just pray for it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@3Dboxingblog @elicarmona86 @wfaa Because science can never truly be uniform they'll always be desenters to reasonable points. IE some people still believe the earth is flat and you can survive only on breathing but conventional wisdom tells us otherwise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@3Dboxingblog @elicarmona86 @wfaa but you're not following science you're following fringe science. If 7 doctors say shooting yourself in the head is lethal and 3 doctors say it's potentially survivable do you listen to the 7 or play  Russian Roulette?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@3Dboxingblog @elicarmona86 @wfaa even if this were true which I doubt cause you didn't provide such easily obtainable evidence the CDC guidelines still recommends masks over no masks? Are you saying you know more than those brave Americans who could be making bank in the private sector but still choose to serve?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@3Dboxingblog @elicarmona86 @wfaa Also I did further research and this article is talking about masks effectiveness in preventing H1N1 (swine flu) which is transmitted by touch the same institution you cited also posted an article confirming masks do work in abstract   https://t.co/Ox2tkXnMjI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@3Dboxingblog @elicarmona86 @wfaa So what you're telling me is that I should listen to two random institutions instead of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention an American governing body of doctors and researchers who dedicate their lives to public service? That sounds unamerican gary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have an idea for a young black women driven horror movie does blumhouse or A24 take pitch submissions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BMACRESISTOR @julesTX08 @edjunkiecom @TexasTribune You don't try to block votes to the most populous county and the state if you're not afraid of something and this is exactly what the Texas GOP is hoping we forget.

<|startoftext|>@GoggleCannon I would die for them they are so adorable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattndstuff @CombineAkomo @historyoarmani2 @anarchist_black the root of the problem is that racists feel good acting and being racist and if you want them to stop you have to make them feel bad about acting and being racist. racism is a drug for the existential dread of white people who need to feel superior to their fellow man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CombineAkomo @historyoarmani2 @anarchist_black if we want actually heal as a nation we're going to have to break our long standing tradition of never having racists face consequences  https://t.co/cJO4enUks8<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@patqwerty @patty78962 @NBCDFW It says there's change of address information in this then that should be easy to prove and this pending litigation meaning a ruling hasn't even been made If I'm supposed to accept Breonna Taylor's killers going free then you should accept the clark judges ruling only fair<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patty78962 @NBCDFW you and your president deserve each other you both make stuff up and expect everyone to go along with it you all have victim complexes follow him to hell and back if you wish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patty78962 @NBCDFW the independent is a conservative british news site are trying to imply the fix is in all the way in the UK for your little man baby?

<|startoftext|>@patty78962 @NBCDFW no actually I provided my proof in good faith so now it's your time patty show me these documents<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patty78962 @NBCDFW Here's the article from the independet about one of the cases which I'm sure you'll say is also liberal owned u only want to get yor news from people who ferment and drink their own piss  https://t.co/5cF3AZnmIV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patty78962 @NBCDFW I did The exact deposition lists that they brought the claim against the incorrect party had no substantial evidence to back up the claim of voter fraud and that the president can't send additional hand picked poll watchers to PA since the GOP and dems already made selections<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patty78962 @NBCDFW they actually provided NO EVIDENCE to 3 DIFFERENT state courts who laughed them out of the courtroom now I could see maybe one being biased against your dear orange Furher but at 3 that's just bad lawyering<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@austin_hayden @SikhProf you've done nothing to refute anything I've said so far you started a conversation about dems claiming collusion and I brought up the US intelligence community proved it were true Hillary said Trump would throw a tantrum if he didn't win and that's exactly what's happening<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@austin_hayden @SikhProf well you're the one who brought it up so.... you got anything new to add that veteran CIA and FBI investigators don't?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@austin_hayden @SikhProf so are you just willfully omitting that the US intelligence community have well documented evidence of Russian interference and collision happening in the 2016 election or were busy licking tr*mps boots clean for the entire THREE WEEKS that was news?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WRVTH_Xlll @thebroker00 @amxrisymone @h85_l @BeeNicole10 @soaringfavor @TeriyakiGuysNyc @AbeFroman @LilTunechi @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Then why couldn't he do it on national television at the debate?

<|startoftext|>@LilTunechi @realDonaldTrump @POTUS If Trump is really for the community why is he only reaching out to us before an election after he bragged he won the previous election due to black people not voting and said he'll continue to enforce law and order in regard to BLM protests?

<|startoftext|>@___ramsey___ @ThatCommieGamer It's wiggle room to over throw the system mark<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@___ramsey___ @ThatCommieGamer the revolution for capitalism was coming either way mark I just wanna make sure my people are safe it doesn't matter anyway why don't you go to a green party rally and pass out  flyers or something<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatCommieGamer @___ramsey___ you think voting green is the solution you do you I'll vote biden and won't much matter cause all that matters is the struggle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatCommieGamer @___ramsey___ fine sis agree to disagree. But don't you dare accuse me of being okay with the current system of bullshit just cause I'm trying make sure we can survive long enough to make a goddamned change in this country I'm black and LGBTQ just like you I fear the same people you do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatCommieGamer @___ramsey___ They both hate us but have you have seen a republican hesitate to hurt us at least a dem will pretend to care and like I said I'm still gonna charge biden's ass up all day long but fighting a desperate fascist is dangerous and Trump is both<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatCommieGamer @___ramsey___ Whether Biden or Trump won there was still to be a fight but a Biden fight will be less bloody than the Trump one which is not to say the Biden fight will have no blood we just need some wiggle room that no republican fascist would ever give us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatCommieGamer @___ramsey___  https://t.co/D9ZIiv7SZc  also this nigga is trying to play us I'mma vote his ass out and still be ready to take the revolution to biden now it's just the principal of it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatCommieGamer @___ramsey___ And while I am not afraid to die for the struggle I gotta keep in mind the people who are who are and who won't have a choice our elderly our sick, our children we owe it to them to try peace one more time cause when Gabriel's horn blows you have to be ready to go<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatCommieGamer @___ramsey___ War is hell sis. Like true actual hell, a lot of us will not live to see the end of the revolution. Children will not have parents, mothers will being wailing in the streets every night, it will be the true open season on black folks that we've been fearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatCommieGamer @___ramsey___ Yea but we owe to our people to try peace for one more time. The revolution will not be televised but it will be all the way live and we will loose so much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mammals4Life @lore_poe @___ramsey___ You can keep posting things If you want, I'm tryin to figure out how to keep my family safe during 4 more years of trump cause obvi you niggas are going to get us killed with your moral grand standing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mammals4Life @lore_poe @___ramsey___ see you're still istening to non black people instead of black people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mammals4Life @lore_poe @___ramsey___ Because if Biden doesn't win i may not live to see your alternative. That's the fact of it. I'm glad you have the privilege to have elections not be live or die though. When we say 'by any means necessary"  that sometimes means voting for someone you don't 100 percent agree with<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mammals4Life @lore_poe @___ramsey___ You're worried for the Iraqi people and that is commendable after all this country has done to them but do you worry for the homeless people in your city? Do you worry for the poor black neighborhoods across America what do you think they have to lose in this fight. Everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mammals4Life @lore_poe @___ramsey___ Then we demand better of Biden. Then we demand better of all our politicians but that's only a conversation we can have if there isn't an insane fascist in office the fight doesn't stop with the vote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mammals4Life @lore_poe @___ramsey___ Trump isn't going to give us very many more days to try and fight and of he does they are going to be very dark<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mammals4Life @lore_poe @___ramsey___ "Trump will kill my friends trump will kill my neighbors. Trump has already killed 200,000 Americans and he will kill more" black people would love if we could just pick someone different but the system is broke and sometimes the game is surviving so you can fight another day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mammals4Life @lore_poe @___ramsey___ No it's not just Hillary. What you're spewing is the same bull headed American individualism that got us in this mess. Cause you're too selfish to think about your neighbors who are directly going to be harmed by trump winning a second term you'd try a 3rd party in a 2 party syst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mammals4Life @lore_poe @___ramsey___ Y'all pulled this same shit back with Hillary in 2016, now was voting for a third party so you could have the "morally correct" choice worth the last 4 years of Trump my brother?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thepomegranatea @___ramsey___ Y'all talked this same shit in 2016 with Hillary was moral superiority worth the last four years?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thepomegranatea @___ramsey___ even the panthers got people registered cause they knew how important it was<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thepomegranatea @___ramsey___ will not voting help?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brab0choke @meechiworldwid1 @___ramsey___ You're too good to struggle you're too good to vote sensibly in an election you're too good to think realistically about will happen to your neighbors if trump can get another four years how that'll embolden racists to harm more black people? You're too good to think about that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brab0choke @meechiworldwid1 @___ramsey___ THEN VOTE TILL THEY DO vote with your money vote with your time vote and march and scream and vote and be killed by police and vote again!?! Black people have been surviving like this for years and now suddenly it's too good for you!?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brab0choke @meechiworldwid1 @___ramsey___ This is the hell that you and your people created for us! Getting loans at banks that made money of off slavery, working at places that discriminate higher up just to make ends meat, voting for a racist cause he's less racist than the other racist! WE'RE JUST TRYING TO LIVE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brab0choke @meechiworldwid1 @___ramsey___ "I'm only in this situation because white people stole my ancestors 400 years ago so now every four years I have to pick between two imperialist assholes and so my community doesn't get bulldozed over next week I'm picking the one who at least PRETENDS to care."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@___ramsey___ yeah you're worse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@___ramsey___ @lore_poe I HAVE NEVER IN MY BLACK ASS LIFE HAD THE LUXARY TO VOTE FOR SOMEONE I'D KNOW WOULD LOSE. BLACK PEOPLE HAVE NEVER HAD THAT LUXARY MIKE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why I hate yt liberals so damn much. You'd rather NOT listen to black people so you can throw your vote away on a candidate who YOU KNOW WILL LOSE so you can have a sense of moral superiority while we continue to be murdered by people who said they'd kill us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@___ramsey___ @lore_poe And with all your talk of revolution you better be prepping to support vulnerable communities who'll be targeted during it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@___ramsey___ @lore_poe yeah it will, and I'm still gonna vote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@___ramsey___ @lore_poe so why bother voting for a third part if it can't be voted away?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@___ramsey___ @lore_poe the real enemy has always been capitalism and fascism but we need someone who will at least THNK about gassing protesters while we work to dismantle it also don't vote for the green party they're TERFs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@___ramsey___ @lore_poe can't I still vote and prepare for conflict as my people have always done?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@___ramsey___ @lore_poe and what's your plan for if trump wins a second term? are you planning to shelter those vulnerable to his policies? What's your plan if Biden wins, will still march and rally for black lives?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@___ramsey___ @lore_poe and what's your plan after that? Do you have a contingency for if your candidate looses?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@___ramsey___ @lore_poe why don't you want me to vote mike what do you stand to lose from me voting? what is your alternative?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@___ramsey___ @lore_poe Well Mike you're the man with all the answer what should I do instead of voting?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@___ramsey___ @lore_poe Mike Trump wouldn't listen to black people if his life depended on it you're asking us to take up arms and put ourselves in danger we owe it to ourselves to at least vote and if Biden wins we'll keep fighting then too cause we need a better world regardless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@___ramsey___ @lore_poe they're still purgin active voters from the rolls mike? why would they do that if democracy was really truly dead? Why bother hyping up "voter fraud" if the election was already his why pander to black people if he plans to steal anyway. It's isn't as dead as you think Mike<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@___ramsey___ @lore_poe And if they are doing all of this to make it harder for people to vote than that means voting does still have some power, that means they're afraid of what we can do together. Mike it won't kill you to vote and I can't tell you who to vote for but doing nothing ain't the move<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@___ramsey___ @lore_poe You're the foolish one. You've mistaken necessity for loyalty. I vote cause people are still being purged from the rolls, because counties are being gerrymandered to shit, and cause Trump has his zombies scaring people away. I vote cause it's clear they and you don't want me to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@___ramsey___ @lore_poe Ya wanna help black people mike do what black people have been doing vote and keep fighting. Vote for a dem write letters when they fuck up vote them out when they don't listen rinse and repeat. Like I said the vote is part of the fight not the end just a part<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@___ramsey___ @lore_poe the civil rights act which republicans then proceeded to strip over a period 50 years are you getting the picture Mike. We don't do it cause we think it's going to fix everything we do it cause we need someone who's going sit at the table at least once<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@___ramsey___ @lore_poe It is but relovlution would hurt so many vunerable people get hem killed even, get us killed, get me killed, we owe democracy one last chance before we take up arms. Is it going to kill you to vote one more time, Mike? To give it one my try?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@___ramsey___ @lore_poe Yeah cause the other guy would march me into a gas chamber to make his radical base happy see! It's "death or a fight" and we pick the fight every time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@___ramsey___ @lore_poe because at least the democrats are willing to be fair. The choice for us has always been "death or a a fight", and pick the fight cause otherwise repubs would FastTrack killing us. You've been blessed enough to have not make this choice every four years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lore_poe @___ramsey___ When we talked revolution y'all parents didn't want to hear that shit and it got us brutally gun downed so stayed low stayed quiet and voted. Voting is not marriage It's a bus route and you go with whoever can get you close Trump is going to drive us off a cliff Biden won't<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lore_poe @___ramsey___ since the 60s black people have had to make the choice between someone who cares little about communities vs. someone who'd love to see us set back and each time we choose the former and that is how we have survived in this goddamn country<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meechiworldwid1 @___ramsey___ Yeah we vote for "ineffective" democrats because at least democrats are willing to talk to us about our problems and even then we still have to fight ,rally and march to get them to act. A republican hasn't given black people the time of day since the 60s with the platform switch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lore_poe @___ramsey___ what do you think black people have been doing since the 60s? Just real interested in what think we do every election cycle when we're once again faced with someone who is an unequivocal racist and someone who's democrat we can at least talk to Trump is packing courts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Black people have voted in the face of poisoned water, shut down schools an HIV epidemic a crack epidemic and whatever the hell us the US government was throwing at us that election cycle you can be assed to do it one more time to try and save our democracy and keep fighting on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@___ramsey___ Voting is the first step in the revolution my brother! and prepping for what happens after I know it sounds crass but black people still voted in the face poisoned water every election cycle since Nixon you can be assed to do it one more time to save democracy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mirijan @trishcrawford @CNN then that means the law needs to be re worked not stripped away entirely? Trump hasn't even presented an alternative to ACA that does the bare minimum that it did<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarianneDHobbit Duo pls don't hurt my friend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@littleramyun Yo!   https://t.co/14f0PiifYe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like real talk should America be represented as a white guy still?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GabeKunda The masked singer caused corona but black people saying cops are racist is a conspiracy  lord give me peace please lord<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to remind every #Christian that Jesus was put to death by the oppressive Roman government for doing exactly what the protesters in #Louisville. If you side with the authority you would have cheered at Jesus's crucifixion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a very good thread about the people who enabled fascism and it's horrors. People saying "protest the correct way" would sell you out to death. They aren't playing devil's advocate they are the devil<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Choo choo! All aboard for another exciting installment in thousand year door Thursday! We're #streaming now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShieldHero55 @KimMortonYep @BlackDGamer1 You're just arguing for the sake of arguing. You say rep shouldn't be left up to major companies but you have no clue what black creatives have to sacrifice to make change happen for themselves. Have a good life man, I wish I could care as little as you do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShieldHero55 @KimMortonYep @BlackDGamer1 Racebait. Disney racebaited black audiences before turning heel. they have been guilty of it in the past with their animated films. you don't even know what racebaiting is? Don't you think Disney sticking to their guns about rep would've helped sway Chinese audiences<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We know what happened in 2016 interlopers came and sowed doubt into us we need to be a wave we need to be a surge there needs to be no room for doubt #VOTE and prepare for whatever comes after<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@merchantarthurn Yeah to combat this I've been responding with "will it kill you to do it anyway?" And some accounts just go silent it's erie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm mad as hell about #BreonnaTaylor but I'm still gonna vote. Those people telling you voting won't matter or won't change anything are lying to you. Even if you think it won't matter it's only a bit of time out of your day so go do it anyway! fucking #VOTE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GabeKunda It never was 😒<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why would we ever wanna save a system that gives us no justice #AbolishThePolice no cap no negotiations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm trying NOT to throw my bra into a lit fireplace, cover my face in the ashes, and go running down the street howling like a banshee about #JusticeForBreonnaTaylor  The more I try to talk myself out of it the angrier I get.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laura_stahl I'm trying to keep it together at work but at this point I'm just so mad<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JakeSteal1 @BlackDGamer1 Wow my mom was right Niggas ain't shit but a tongue and a dick all you've done is charge me up but no more my brotha have a good life  https://t.co/MIr9Ck8GyZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JakeSteal1 Anyway what black content creators are you following? I'd love to check them out if you don't mind. Gotta support rep where it starts!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackDGamer1 @JakeSteal1 I simply asked what black creatives this person was supporting so i can check them out and see if i want to either a) support them myself or b) make reccs to people who could like their content  Cause that's how you support content! Do you know how to build an audience at all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackDGamer1 @JakeSteal1 People literally pay to see showings and adaptations for the room people get dvds to get it signed by tommy money is money under capitalism "hun"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well the only way to truly win is to prove folks wrong so stay posted I'm gonna check somethings maybe it's time i build that audience for myself for once<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackDGamer1 @JakeSteal1 White people have countless terrible movies out "the room" has an entire brand built on it being bad. You're just b.s. ing you don't actually want to have this convo at all  You just wanna be right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshuadavdking I remember watching this scene in fences and feeling my heart choke. I get where the generational trauma comes from but it felt so strange watching it be celebrated and normalized the son in the movie is later told to be grateful his father was only kind of a SOB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackDGamer1 @JakeSteal1 So now it has to be good? But art is subjective. Good is subjective. It seems like you're just policing people's content mr.wrongman.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackDGamer1 @JakeSteal1 But you were saying black people should make their own representation i want to support that content from black people if i can what's problem now wrongman? It seems you have a lot of rules about this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JakeSteal1 @BlackDGamer1 What indie black creators are you supporting? I want to support them too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope you're wrong!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackDGamer1 actually I just realized! I'm right and you're wrong! Bye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackDGamer1 why don't you want to hold media accountable for their short comings in the representation and diversity department? Black people already have to fight for every goddamn thing, why do you want us to be constantly laboring for our place in the world?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShieldHero55 @BlackDGamer1 Have you ever built an audience?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShieldHero55 @BlackDGamer1 you can't even grasp sarcasm why I am talking to you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShieldHero55 @BlackDGamer1 I can do all of those things but you know who doesn't have to do all of those things and will incur far less risk and has dedicated marketing department? Sony. Why don't you want media companies to do better and be accountable? What do you have against this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShieldHero55 @BlackDGamer1  https://t.co/VdFEdkwYOm Here's my kofi my project costs 210,000 for the animatic pls donate the exact amount<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the1tigirius @DatWoof @BlackDGamer1 Do you think Luke Cage is as popular a comic hero as spiderman? Storm is a little closer as far as being well known and she's lightwashed constantly also a lot those marvel characters were created by stan lee a Jewish man  He had to make representation for black people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haru3139 You haven't responded to my previous arguments do you wish to concede?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frostofthecwsw @_AlexHirsch Even if doesn't work would it kill you to vote anyway?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haru3139 And careful haru you're sounding like you're arguing in bad faith. You keep latching on to small details instead of actually responding to my points and you've yet to read the article I've sent and provide counter points. You're stalling. And i have no time for sea lions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haru3139 Well you said you don't read vice cause they post stupid articles every journalism platform post stupid puff pieces do you not read any of them as well?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haru3139 There's no such thing as a perfect journalism platform and if you think there is you're being fed propaganda<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haru3139 Vice is an awarding winning journalism platform known for their in depth looks at uncomfortable topics if you don't like the articles they post it's cause it was made to make you uncomfortable. While i have criticisms of their work that doesn't make them unreliable or stupid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haru3139  https://t.co/M6MRlwMEDA Also here's a telling Vice article about how hard it is for black women to get into the industry and a new pipeline for letting them in. These were very easily found on google but I guess you wanted me to do it for you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haru3139 well for tv there's not a lot and there aren't even a lot of indie animations I know of but here's a graphic novel by a black artist!  https://t.co/vhN2WM3TKD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haru3139 "a hand in a major" cartoon not running their own.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tc1361 @tracally66 @NBCDFW Yes but still very similar. We know they come trees we know they need sun to live we know they need soil and what climate they need to be in to flourish we knew what makes disease bare the twisted fruit of current reality if you don't want to accept that it's on you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tc1361 @tracally66 @NBCDFW they are both infectious diseases bunchofnumbers badopinions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haru3139 Hey Haru did you know in the history of American television there has only been a few major cartoons that were showrun by an African American woman? do you honestly think that black women aren't making art and cartoons and comics? Are you supporting people making that content?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollywood_Solo @DatWoof @BlackDGamer1 If all it takes is hard work and talent why are you here yelling on twitter certainly you have a million dollar idea you could be producing and making successful if it's really THAT easy. Go make a comic start your own ip tell me how it goes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollywood_Solo @DatWoof @BlackDGamer1 But dan if that's easy why isn't there more rep in mainstream media? Why aren't there more original ips by blpoc creatives on TV? Either you believe that everyone that screams about representation CAN'T cut it in the industry which is statically unlikely or maybe...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am. My problem is that other people can't. creativity shouldn't be gatekept by money and unpaid labor and companies that do have a billion dollars laying around for their next lame-o action film could at LEAST have a black lead more than once a film<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haru3139 Nothing except it being a huge gamble. Sinking that much time money and effort into production is a major risk money wise. Even investing in the equipment i needed to get started as a VA was gamble that could have not worked out. I'm thankful for my success<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tc1361 @tracally66 @NBCDFW ah so what you're saying is that from those handful cases the disease didn't continue to spread, infect and kill other Americans because it was handled quickly and seriously?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DatWoof @BlackDGamer1 And actually I am funding my own project btw if you want to follow and support it You know where to find me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DatWoof @BlackDGamer1 I'm literally a working freelance voice actress and twitch streamer it's in my bio If the solution was as simple black people making black characters the matter of representation would have been solved ages ago<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tracally66 @NBCDFW Well you're not wrong...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrendanBlaber Yeah my list of social activism goes  -voting -peacefully protesting  -breaking into the governor's house wearing a bull's skull and a 9 iron in the southpaw -registering people to vote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PlumCat3 @CNN @CNNOpinion Right! And who's responsibility was it to make sure pharma prices don't skyrocket so Americans never have to decide between food or medicine? Asking for a friend who needs insulin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tracally66 @NBCDFW I don't remember the CDC having this many errors during the ebola out break wonder what's changed?/s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMullenixVO Hope everything is alright man. I'm here to talk if you need it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While I'm not saying EVERYONE who's mad about how this #2020Election turned out is a Russian psyopp I'm just saying given what we know about the 2016 election be really weary of people and accounts who insist #Voting won't do anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The work will not be done by just the #Vote alone you are correct but that doesn't mean the #vote is any less important to the work.   Do not get confused do not get discouraged and #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica  And be ready for whatever comes after<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To everyone saying "#Voting won't change anything"  #Trump wouldn't be enticing his MAGAgoons to sit outside polling places and watch for "fraud" if he wasn't a little scared of what a high turnout against him would look like so like it won't kill you to #Vote anyways 😒<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why yes adult swim I'd love to<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AChanelol @BlackDGamer1 Miles Morales is a billion dollar character now, and Craig of the Creek is doing numbers on CN despite it's white creators they were willing to take a shot on a black lead and it's worked out wonderfully it's not scraps if it's done right sis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AChanelol @BlackDGamer1 And when other companies see billion dollar companies like Sony showing off black representation and being successful while having a black main character maybe they'll want to buy an original IP from one of those tumblrs,youtubers, twitch streamers ect. This is why Rep matters!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AChanelol @BlackDGamer1 And there are plenty of black content creators on those platforms! but OP was complaining about being excited for rep in a AAA game instead of making your own rep We are making our own rep but we can still be happy when billionaire companies like Sony also do rep<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pappytayy09 @AChanelol @BlackDGamer1 exactly and I'm talking about rep beyond just tv and stage plays! Where are black lead platformers and RPGs where's our all black cast sci fi adventure movies?  Why have black adult animated sitcoms kind of plateaued? where are those projects where can we fund and support them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AChanelol @BlackDGamer1 No Tyler Perry made money reinforcing harmful stereotypes about black culture and women and now severely under pays his crew and puts them on impossible filming schedules plus that's one person and last I checked Tyler ain't making a AAA video game studio<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackDGamer1 "Just make your own POC characters and your own poc media" and who's gonna fund it bruh? You gonna pay my bills while i write this pilot? You gonna pay for the plane ticket for this pitching meeting so i can get shot down for my show not reaching "the right demographics"?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Aiden10319916 @kittiebabiee @Thefireball1510 @SandyShriver9 @_Floodlight @Stonekettle You are not very bright and very loud how typical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Aiden10319916 @kittiebabiee @Thefireball1510 @SandyShriver9 @_Floodlight @Stonekettle It's jokes man. That's the point blm has caused way less damage than gender reveals but is way more demonized. You just want to fight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Aiden10319916 @kittiebabiee @Thefireball1510 @SandyShriver9 @_Floodlight @Stonekettle The op was making a joke about how American conservative media was successful at turning blm into rioters and thugs by conflating the damage they were causing to property as a tragic loss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Aiden10319916 @kittiebabiee @Thefireball1510 @SandyShriver9 @_Floodlight @Stonekettle There's an inherent issue with cops killing people every two days but those are just "a few bad apples" but we can blame every single protester calling  for the actions of violent interlopers? Where is the line?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Aiden10319916 @kittiebabiee @Thefireball1510 @SandyShriver9 @_Floodlight @Stonekettle No the issue is that fox news radicalized a bunch of white folks to think the protesters were going to come into their suburbs and destroy everything but they won't radicalize those same people against gender reveal parties even though they've caused more damage comparatively<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I'd talk about how i wanted to be a VA they'd call me the most hedious names imaginable. Slurs i couldn't even begin to repeat. it knocked me breathless at the time. They were my age and they never grew out of it they festered in fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course #anitwit is racist. I told y'all how anime forums in the late 2000s were so toxic i quit watching shows for most of high school. Those kids calling me the n word on those boards way back when are just entitled 20 somethings with twitter now<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EvanDecker10 Fair! But I also remember everyone getting up in arms about virtual console going away and calling nintendo evil demons and then the SNES and NES online came out. SNES and NES online have some draw backs and pluses comparatively to VC but over all is a positive experience<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is everyone mad that #supermario3dallstars is a limited release? This isn't even the first time nintendo has done limited edition sales of games/consoles and we don't know what's coming after these games (N64 online/GCN online) I'm waiting and seeing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I busted out of my crypt this morning to hear this news!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MewtwosBalls You said there's plenty of black characters but do they get the same marketing as white characters do? Do their comics get pushed as hard? If a black version of IronMan exists why didn't Disney use that version instead of RDJ? Why was white iron-man the first choice?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MewtwosBalls Yes white people can write black characters! How does this relate to your original point of blackwashing being just as bad as whitewashing? If white people can write black characters why don't they write more in more leading positions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MewtwosBalls So it seems you were unable to I went ahead and googled famous cowboys. Notice that most of the cowboys in these movies are white and that Django isn't even among the first results. Why do you think that is?  https://t.co/pLvvxEhA1c<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MewtwosBalls you want me to say no so you can prove your point but how many black marvel leads are there? How many white marvel leads are there?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MewtwosBalls Well there's not a history of white people being written out of their own stories. In fact there's more of a history of white people writing themselves into stories they weren't in IE cowboys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MewtwosBalls Historically cowboys were either black, Mexican, or native american but how many famous black, native, or mexican cowboys are there in media? How many famous white cowboys are there in media?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MewtwosBalls Like I said April O'neal was black in her first appearance in the comic but in the TMNT cartoon she was changed to white, why do you think that happened?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MewtwosBalls No I was talking about drawing princess peach black, yeah she won't be canon so why do you care if she's drawn black?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MewtwosBalls Do you think there's a concentrated effort to erase white people from media? Do you think there's a long history of white people not having their stories told? Do you think white people had pitches for shows shut down cause their white male character wasn't marketable?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MewtwosBalls Well white people aren't erased from media, they are in fact very well represented. Do you think black people are just as represented in media as white people? In the case of John Green and the original justice league tv series he is the only black man in the main cast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MewtwosBalls but that original character won't be in mario?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MewtwosBalls Who are black artist trying to pander to by making characters black? Yes it can be pandering when major studios do it but what's wrong with drawing princess peach black? There's no black women in the Mario series<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MewtwosBalls Also black canary isn't a black character she's named that way cause she "sings" to kill her enemies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MewtwosBalls But in my original tweet I explained why whitewashing is harmful. Do you need me to repeat why or do you not understand?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MewtwosBalls There are a lot of really great black characters! But what's wrong with wanting more black characters in a show? I should also bring up April O'neal was black in some of her first appearances in the tmnt comics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MewtwosBalls Interesting... what makes you think these artists aren't making and designing black characters of their own? And do you not see enough fan art of already canon black characters from black artists?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MewtwosBalls So it's racist and insulting to black people when black people re-draw a white character to look like them (a black person) ? I'm understanding that correctly?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if @MatthewACherry can speak it into existence so can I!  https://t.co/qjaQQ9xidI<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@moviesforlife6 @TrickyMJ @Antonyo_337 @rawbert626 @uf6gig @MightyKeef So if you combine definition 2 with it's sub definition racism is a System of Prejudice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@moviesforlife6 @TrickyMJ @Antonyo_337 @rawbert626 @uf6gig @MightyKeef Note that in definition 2 it specifically says System(s) and all the things I listed are Systematic oppression that happened to black people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrickyMJ @moviesforlife6 @Antonyo_337 @rawbert626 @uf6gig @MightyKeef This would also include red lining neighborhoods where middle eastern people stay, defunding schools, flooding their streets with highly addictive drugs, killing their leaders when they try to organize their political power, erasing them from key historical moments ect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrickyMJ @moviesforlife6 @Antonyo_337 @rawbert626 @uf6gig @MightyKeef I could be mean to middle eastern people based on where they're from and that's a prejudice But if I'm mean to middle eastern people and my family has a 300 year history of enslaving,stripping of rights and criminalization middle east ppl that's where the 'isms' come into to play<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Cause if they Are trying to change and be better you have to be willing to be the bigger person and focus on those who aren't willing to change This is still very emotionally exhausting<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kianamaiart I was writing a pilot for an adult animated series and had my confidence knocked to nothing this summer learning how toxic the animation industry is to black artist especially black women.

<|startoftext|>@aGingerGrant @Richard16211139 @KhoroShogun @jsmccullou And even if the police didn't have anything to do with her death when someone dies in police custody even as a suicide that's a failure of the police just like if a child broke their neck due to being unsupervised at school it'd be a failure of the school<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aGingerGrant @Richard16211139 @KhoroShogun @jsmccullou So her making a presumptive video about how if she ever turned up dead in police custody to investigate her death because she wouldn't commit suicide because she knew morons like you would accept any bullshit excuse from the state was one long ploy then to frame the police?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aGingerGrant @KhoroShogun @Richard16211139 @jsmccullou the state can allocate all the time ,money, and energy to hunt down graffiti artists instead of coming up with measures that can keep you and your family safe in the pandemic A state wide shut down is risky to our state economy but tax payer money can be wasted on petty man hunts<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KhoroShogun @Richard16211139 @jsmccullou I just think it's so fun how the state had plenty of time and resources to locate protesters via social media but swaths Texas teachers are writing their fucking wills because the state sent our children and loved ones back to disease riddled schools  https://t.co/hsKfinGDDO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never out of touch or out of time on our #ThousandYearDoorThursday #twitchstreams starting tonight at 6 pm CST!   Is a Mario by any other name still a plumber? @PuddleKanono and I aim to find out! #blackgirlgamer    https://t.co/ruo0m8K4VF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DJohnsonVA 🎶generational trauma isn't an excuse for bad parenting don't get mad cause i no longer want to engage with yooou🎶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GlimmerGremlin I am impressed by your dedication and angry you've not been rewarded for your work<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PuddleKanono Awww baby 💜💙💜💙💜💙💜<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PuddleKanono I love you bitch ain't ever gonna stop loving you bitch  https://t.co/3lrcgOiS7l<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When he's in the booth I'm always impressed by his range and performance. It takes a lot to be a decent voice actor or engineer or director and Kim has the unmitigated gall to be awesome at all 3 and i luv him that is all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't ever really talk about how proud I am of @PuddleKanono in more professional senses. Even though we're in love or whatever Kim is always the director who pushes me the hardest and I've seen him produce fantastic demos that get results.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hbomax I'm loving the service but when is an app for smart tvs coming? Casting is murder on my battery life!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had to see see kim k's bare greasy ass on this site for 2 weeks while she "broke the Internet" y all gone give cardi and meg the time a day you gave her<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know I'm late to the #WAP discourse but i can't stress enough how insidious it is that black girls and black women are sexualized and fetishized for their features by just about everyone but the moment black women start showing agency in their sexuality it's a damn problem  https://t.co/388mJRfjsM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyPowrie @countHoshioni @Sword_darkrai17 And you're right Toei is doing it because funi and crunch aren't ruining small content creator's lives with a licencing lawsuit their getting pass the middleman to sue people faster<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyPowrie @countHoshioni @Sword_darkrai17 So when you have a clip of dragon ball z in your youtube video Toei can say you stole content from their youtube channel directly and work around those pesky fair use policies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyPowrie @countHoshioni @Sword_darkrai17 Toei is making a youtube So they can better police their content on the platform not cause they're getting ad revenue money. By making their own channel for content they've streamlined their ability to have videos taken down<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyPowrie @countHoshioni @Sword_darkrai17 Also considering that most anime is made and produced well before any licensing deal is made it's the Japanese license holders themselves screwing over the animators<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyPowrie @countHoshioni @Sword_darkrai17 You have a very excellent point but what you're talking about has to do with the undervaluing of art in a free market world. Trends like this are being reflected in other entertainment platforms as well the animators were underpaid BEFORE funi bought the licence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyPowrie @countHoshioni @Sword_darkrai17 If funi and crunch are responsible then why are the problems of artists being over worked and under paid also a problem in manga and video games as well? Perhaps this speaks to a bigger problem with how society views art and its worth and funi and crunch have pay out the nose btw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was a big problem I had entering the American collegic system most of my life was spent being "the gifted smart black girl" and when college became mentally overwhelming i struggled with an identity crisis over not being the "black excellence" model my family wanted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're already half way there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also American Minstrel shows should really be taught in college theatre and film programs as a cautionary tale about how media and storytelling can be used to reinforce harmful stereotypes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching white gen z kids on #TikTok incorrectly use #aave for views is feels like watching a minstrel show without the black face.  No. I am not excepting criticism at this time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldAShults FINALLY SOMEONE WHO GETS IT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy Monday! @PuddleKanono and I are gonna be back with #PaperMario at 6 pm cst! We hope to see ya there!  https://t.co/ruo0m8K4VF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dallas *has ONE August day that isn't unbearably hot*   My bi Autumn loving ass "Oh boy! I better break out the flannel!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SirEzioAuditore @__NoSwagg @TweetOrSTFU @MojoDisco So to be clear the options here are be forthcoming and get murdered  Or Not be as forthcoming and still be murdered! Gee!  Just tell your bros to be better people! Stop putting the work the oppressor needs to do on the opressed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the cycle continues...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're back with #SuperPaperMario Sunday! Today is going to be a very dramatic installment in our adventure, you don't wanna miss it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YorunoYamiyo @countHoshioni @Sword_darkrai17 Licencors won't so much as let director's posting outtakes from shows anymore (which is why they've disappeared from youtube) if Japan thought this line was too much they would have had it pulled<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YorunoYamiyo @countHoshioni @Sword_darkrai17 and how do you know that the dialect in the original Japanese didn't reflect a disgust like misogamy. That's what the direct English translation yes but that doesn't mean the exact kanji used didn't have some sort of subtextual meaning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YorunoYamiyo @countHoshioni @Sword_darkrai17 If you don't like women that's ok but don't get mad when media calls you out on it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YorunoYamiyo @countHoshioni @Sword_darkrai17 Dude translations like that happen across all media it's a part of localization. In Paper Mario:TTYD a woman calls her husband a "Chauvinist Pig" and that game was translated in house at NOA do you think that was "political" in 2004? Jokes have to fit the times and sentiments<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YorunoYamiyo @countHoshioni @Sword_darkrai17 What's so funny about all of this is I'm certain everyone remembers that Toei was going to sue teamfourstar into oblivion and now it's all  "aw evil american companies hurt japan uwu"   like do you think they aren't that strict with Funi either?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're back with #TheThousandYearDoor Saturday!?! Yep sure are with a few surprises this Saturday Matinee? What could they be? You'll have to come find out 😉😘😗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@countHoshioni @Sword_darkrai17 Sorry I don't have time to talk to industry outsiders who think they know with these relationships are like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@countHoshioni @Sword_darkrai17 Also the ordered shut down of your precious sites probably came from Japan just FYI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@countHoshioni @Sword_darkrai17 Buddy, you think Japan is getting screwed over by Funi and Crunchroll?  Now I know you don't know what you're talking about! Maybe go to a few more industry panels at your local cons before you embarrass yourself again. Or try working in licensing.  https://t.co/ODcvMGIvsU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@countHoshioni @Sword_darkrai17 imagine feeling elite for contributing to the reason why funi and crunch had to start hording rights? Someone doesn't remember the anime blackouts of 2007 and 2008<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KingKRoolG @laura_stahl cause it's fun🤨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Silverhyina @laura_stahl @ChrisHackneyGGK Haha nice try Bozo Opinions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laura_stahl @KingKRoolG nah Laura this guy is a flamer, says things to get a rise just report his account so he can go crawling back to one of his five proxy accounts he has set up. How pathetic of you @KingKRoolG ? Are you five? Did mommy help you log in to the pretty bird website?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KingKRoolG This little game you're playing gets old so fast! I'm sure several people have already reported this account you know with enough twitter will ban you no questions asked. They have a moral imperative they like to pretend to follow so you're acct gets shuttered but I know you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KingKRoolG @laura_stahl You think it's funny to show your dick to the internet to get chuckles cause it's all a game to you, a said little game of attention. You could be nice make friends be a better person but nothing scratches that itch like spewing hateful rhetoric but the thing is...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KingKRoolG @laura_stahl I bet you think this funny and cute being contrarian for the sake laughing at the pain of others lighting a fire under people to get a rise but I crawled out of the same dark pit of you the internet you think you fished your sewage personality from. Let's play the feud shall we?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KingKRoolG @laura_stahl yeah i said you wouldn't.... can't you read void human?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KingKRoolG @roadwprkahead @iRadinVerse @laura_stahl Hey man Idk why you're licking boots and jacking off cops but i hope you find peace with yourself and are able to come back to these and realize how heartless you sound or maybe you never do and you remain a void who can only get off to pain either way I'm reporting you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hideki_Naganuma It's ok man we still stan that Sonic Rush soundtrack<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I'm 5'4 and I'm a lot of people who are you?"   I'm saving this as a verse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cwen33 @VanessaTourio7 @percolately @GeorgeTakei take into account that a child not wearing a mask in the tube of recirculated air puts THE CHILD at risk and leaves the airline LIABLE if God forbid he caught it post flight. She wasn't endangering the passengers she was endangering her own son<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SheckyX I really wish people would stop using "Americans" when what they mean is "white Americans and their cult of individualism" African Americans have known what socialism is and have often fought for social systems in our neighborhoods<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember when everyone said HRC was the greatest threat to Democracy for a one time lapse in judgment over personal vs. private emails and now here we are 4 years and millions of deaths later watching Trump literally ripping mailboxes out of the ground<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dommedeluise @LuciaLobosvilla There is no defense to it! That's the point! I'm sorry y'all are sooo late to the party of constantly having to shuck and jive to get ANYONE IN GOVERNMENT who at least MIGHT think twice before sending you to your death but welcome in take off your shoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lucia is right and she say it. Women don't have to he happy about women characters in very VERY flawed narratives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We hope you all understand and we'd appreciate your continued support it helps a lot!   Stay tuned for more updates!💜<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>... Is something we definitely have been enjoying doing and it's been great connecting with all of you. We want to bring you all even more content but in order to do that we have to do some housekeeping that sometimes ends up taking more time than expected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...To support ourselves and our dreams So it's imperative we put those things first so we can continue to bring you various forms of content whether that be playing Paper Mario games or Kim's Saturday voice acting streams. We ask for your continued support because this...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey guys unfortunately a stream might not happen at all tonight. I know you all are probably sick of the reworking and cancellations and in the future we'll try to maintain some sense of consistency but the fact of the matter is @PuddleKanono and i do have to work full time...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IssaRae Ain't that just the way haha ha...  https://t.co/afJuRyHyi2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kieraplease Yes but if people have an aversion to me using it for them cause it infringes their identity i adjust my language<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A quick fun game you can play with your friends to see if they have taste 🦁  https://t.co/1E0tZMzRpg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarianneDHobbit Jesus Mary and Joseph some people really missed the day they were handing out brain stems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MalaraBaku @hganzo @reedthurston @Daurmith this was a pretty great and raw monologue to kick s4 off ngl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>UPDATE! We're moving our #PaperMario : The Thousand Year Door stream to FRIDAY NIGHT this week to accommodate @PuddleKanono and my work schedule! #CanIbeatit Is going to be Saturday night<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now ranking all my favorite R&amp;B songs by how good the ad libs at the end are<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for hanging out with us this #stream for #papermario we'll be back Thursday for #ThousandYearDoor   Oh! And a happy belated #VoreDay  to all!  https://t.co/K8xax90Gye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're live! Come chill with us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come hang with us and forget your worries! Or not...  https://t.co/jfqXGjnN8C<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having a support network of other actors is great but it can become overwhelming when all the people around you are booking on a more consistent basis and feelings of envy are normal just don't let them tinge your relationships. Having another creative outlet works too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listen I don't have to accept H*zbin Hotel as an "inclusive win" for animation ESPECIALLY in the face of news of #drawingwhileblack artists and animators getting ghosted for jobs. It's a great indie win, but we still have a lack of black voices problem in animation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A little bit change of plans Friday night is for #mariokart8 Live now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me "I should stop spending unnecessarily while in lockdown"  Also Me  https://t.co/HKjhIoVvLO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now that I've played OOT ENOUGH of the bullshit if you say Wind Waker is bad we throwin hands<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're back and ready to solve the mysteries of the Glitz Pit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CheyenneTheGeek you've summoned me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"It is What it is" has been on heavy rotation  https://t.co/BTWbHgjZYR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>so what you're saying is we should treat trump supporters as what they always have been: Racists? Done!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No man ever broke my heart like Ginko 😞  https://t.co/E1Ot7MAiYC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want you all to understand: #voting for #Biden2020 this election cycle isn't deciding between a revolution or staying complacent. You're voting for a peaceful revolution vs. A very bloody one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Chronicles of Narnia" is an Isekai<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimlinhTran And that's another problem our industry has is this cloak and dagger esque way of communication. That's fine for NDAs and big projects but not for basic things like "How make living wage as a VA" or "Who accepts fan works as good experience" We could benefit from more open talk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimlinhTran yeah! If more people knew who accepts fan work as valid work experience and who doesn't we'd be gucci! It's a preference that needs to be communicated more clearly cause IT IS great experience<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimlinhTran ...In your resume and background they should communicate that more clearly as a preference cause there are other people who DO accept fanworks as relevant background work CAUSE IT IS I have no problem with directors not wanting to see but they should say that upfront<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimlinhTran Some people think stage acting is necessary to be a successful VA some people don't believe that to be so. Some people think Pro Tools is industry standard when their are others who use other DAWS It's not consistent If a director/casting agent/ doesn't want fanworks ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimlinhTran Hold on! Kim actually isn't arguing in bad faith. What he's trying to say is no two directors have the same opinion on what counts as valid work. So it stands to reason that some people are hot on fandubs while other people don't care and it would be nice if it was communicated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anairis_q @WildCardTheShow Nice as always sis! Congrats!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PuddleKanono This man rolled outta bed with the hot takes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PuddleKanono and I are back for more this #PaperMario Monday at 7pm CST! Why don't you come and relax recreationally with us at  https://t.co/ruo0m8K4VF  https://t.co/y3hDz6xTfO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DylanMobleyVO @LuciaLobosvilla @StarMan_Studios Congrats! Treat the #VOheroes well for me! ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MICODIN2 @tubawidow @BunEBaby1 @CortesSteve There's a difference between nazis having a bad ideology and Nazis thinking you ALSO believe in their bad ideology  because Nazis don't really ever support non or anti fascists you see it's apart of their whole deal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@i_wear_a_leaf @BunEBaby1 @CortesSteve Conservatives being too dumb to realize the Nazis were calling themselves socialists to soften the blow that they were actually Nationalist fascists is going to be a running theme<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NMZuka Yo happy bday Zuka! Hope you have a great 30!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CheyenneTheGeek I've wanted one since this song came out ngl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CheyenneTheGeek Thanks sis now I gotta buy it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>man #instagram is just linkedin for bad bitches and video vixens<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't trust people who say "Capitan Marvel" was a forgettable film even if you weren't a fan of brie Larson's portrayal there is a whole ass dope plot twist in that movie that no one ever talks about<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't call me out like this 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ya know Republicans are really good at making out social systems that we all paid into for emergencies like these via our tax dollars as "getting stuff for free" lol those people paid for their unemployment with every allowance taken out of their paychecks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lazuulitears back when I worked for the siren and before the bf I would practice trying to talk to girls while on bar and I'm amazed no one ever just called the cops<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lazuulitears girls are so powerful... it can be hard sometimes😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're right back at it with #ThousandYearDoor Thursday ! Come hang out with us at 6 pm CST as we #stream more of the door!   https://t.co/ruo0m8K4VF<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pixelsandpins They missed the end of nge airings now that was inappropriate content!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone acts like Country, Dubstep, Kpop, or Vaporwave are cringe music genres to be into but the only true cringe music genre is Yacht Rock. This album art is dope though  https://t.co/wYts8emp0h<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I might be being possessed by a Florida retiree in his 70s atm but there is not a lot of better feelings than a mellow Steely Dan song on Sunday afternoon in July<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvanSixtyFour Why do you remind me of my biggest regrets?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevinDThelwell What gets me is that she's mad about a witches "sacrificing" a baby which isn't even like the worst thing that's ever aired on this block, if she finds out about Too Many Cooks she's gonna explode<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevinDThelwell Exactly! You better be working the mute and channel return button combo if you wanna see the next episode of Case Closed That was premeditation I knew what I was getting into<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now that's a #ThousandYearDoor Thursday @PuddleKanono<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listen, the emotional trauma of seeing a child be ripped apart at the tender age of 9 thanks to me not listening to my mom or the #AdultSwim content warning is just the L I had to take I certainly never blamed Cartoon Network for that! Sooner girl must be new<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@saneashouses @MichaelPacholek @Imagine71376213 @eveewing @KeeangaYamahtta Hey wanna know something funny? You two are both right and these factors aren't mutually exclusive Yes America has been shifting more right as whole and also we as dems did sort of drag our feet even if DNC let us down by pushing HC  over Bernie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A new edition to the family has arrived! What day should we start adding this bad boy to the #PaperMario #streaming roster?  #PaperMarioTheOrigamiKing  https://t.co/gnVv1dd6lp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benaphil I've been replaying 64 too! While it has aged it's still a very graceful aging though not having action commands for your first few battles always feels weird when I'm doing a replay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GlimmerGremlin Body hopping as immortality is just reincarnation with less steps<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey Kim and I are going live with #SuperPaperMario as a part of our countdown to #papermarioorigamiking come hang with us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hiring white actors to play non white characters was an ugly time honored tradition in Hollywood  @jennyslate and @mikehenrybro stepping down from their roles allows us to ask "why do we continue to allow black face in #voiceacting "<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kid??? If you don't think I'd deadass want this room after 26 years on this earth (17 of which were spent watching one piece)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The idea that #VoiceActors should play any race they want as long they're good at it, Comes without the very important nuance that white people did black, brown and yellow face FOR YEARS just so they wouldn't have to hire POC actors so maybe remember that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks to everyone who came out to the #CanIbeatit stream tonight! Had a great time hanging out with you all! Be sure to be on the look out for our Sunday stream where I'll start #SuperPaperMario !<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I should probably take ab extended social media break. A lot of stuff on here is just not helping my mental state. But i can't seem to stay off of this place long enough.

<|startoftext|>Thanks to everyone who came to our stream tonight! Sorry about our technical difficulties, we're still ironing out the kinks in our set-up, but thanks for sticking with us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're live on Twitch, come hang out!  https://t.co/yVCcUbTCBE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>But that doesn't mean you get to call more urban sounding ways of speaking "Ghetto".  All black voices are valid and should be used in more unexpected ways in #voiceover (2/2)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like before start saying "sounding ghetto" in regards to POCs in voice acting I need to specify that the negative connotations we associate with AAVEs is an founded linguistic racial bias. Black characters like #miruko shouldn't be pigeon holed into sounding a certain way (1/2)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Attorney General  @kyoag , I request justice for Breonna Taylor. This has gone on far too long. I am tagging five who I hope will do the same. (Apologies is you have already been tagged.)  @CeeCeeVA @BelRusapeVO @anairis_q @GabeKunda @DJohnsonVA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A war I've been fighting everyday without fail by virtue of being black and breathing. I'm so tired...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>even coming to this cursed app to just check notifications or check for casting calls my TL is riddled with black strife and pain, fighting for rights that we should have already had, fighting for equality in work spaces not fully integrated I feel like a soldier in a war<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>full pic for context  https://t.co/5LGU7Jx3FV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the exact thought I had meeting @PuddleKanono at afest 2 years ago  https://t.co/BFYAGXSOlN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>gonna take a bit of a social media break, there's been a lot of great victories today but still a lot of work to be done and a lot black people hurting on the TL right now, so I'm going to try and stay off of this twitter for the rest of today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A huge congrats to my bros @KevinDThelwell and @benbevoicing  For their characters in the #MyHeroAcademia dub! And Mom and Pop are very proud of @anairis_q for landing #Mirko<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@msdanifernandez Huh, so that's why i keep drinking @PuddleKanono blood in the middle of the night<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hot damn! #shamanking  is coming back! I have a reason to go on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anairis_q Corona speed run<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anairis_q Cool cool cool @Starbucks wouldn't make customers wear masks in order to preserve the "Third Space" experience and put us partners in danger of exposure but so nice to see the company won't let me acknowledge my own human rights on top of that. On to greener pastures!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so happy I, my parents, and my grandparents get to live to see this changed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My mom was a social worker for various state programs while we lived there. Imagine being a black woman having to work under that flag. Imagine driving your daughter to school and seeing that flag every morning. It's a wild way to live.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine being a kid seeing a symbol of racism flying in front important government buildings and of course Antebellum homes as well that were on every major street in my town. This is what I mean when I saw I grew up with a much more open form of racism in my life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I remember someone raising the Confederate flag every morning in their yard, that was across the street from my elementary school. But Miss. isn't like Texas where you see the state flag everywhere but I saw it enough. I knew what it was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This one is particularly close to my heart. A lot of know I was born and raised in Miss. all of my family is from the state. I was taught from a very young age that the confederate flag was bad news and I should avoid anyone who had it in their possession<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laura_stahl yep😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also don't be afraid to vocalize these feelings (IN PRIVATE) to a support network of friends. A little validation goes a long way!  Remember you are worthy every single good thing you want in your life! Keep pushing and you'll get there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I'm worthy enough to book roles"  "I'm worthy enough to be successful as an actor"  "I'm worthy of being happy with my career"   After that you can start celebrating your friends successes in earnest knowing that you in time will be celebrated when you get to that place<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jealousy is your mind panicking that you won't achieve your dreams while someone else does. To confront jealousy you have to start saying to yourself your worthy of good things happening to you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thing i wish we talked about more as #voiceover artists is jealousy being a normal emotional response but the important part is managing it. Seeing your friends announce roles while you're in the middle of a dry spell can really put you in a negative mind space<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So my boyfriend has been messing around with the spectograph tool in audition he made this for me for pride month  https://t.co/T2RhIHHNmS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bunhearts @ManiiMade Same here! I just started working on my very first pitch for an animated series this year, hearing all the horror stories of what happens to black artists in the industry has shaken my courage though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@18moptop Christ, people are just coming out of the wood work with their ignorance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mrbybosaurguy @an_gremlin @PlanetofFinks @shaun_vids And when you reach "state sanctioned killing innocent children is fine sometimes" the argument is over. It's pointless you're not talking like someone who wants to be in polite society you think murdering kids with tanks is a debatable subject and not an atrocity game over man!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mrbybosaurguy @an_gremlin @PlanetofFinks @shaun_vids And that's exactly the point. Black people don't owe you an argument on why deserve to live, either you think we do  and this consistent assault on our communities are unjust or on some level you think we don't and wanna debate why tanks killing our kids is just okay sometimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mrbybosaurguy @an_gremlin @PlanetofFinks @shaun_vids but trying to explain in extremely specific instances when fire could or could not be hot (even by misunderstanding) will merely waste your time while your house burns down<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mrbybosaurguy @an_gremlin @PlanetofFinks @shaun_vids premises are immovable states in logic "all humans are equal and deserving of a life free of being hunted by the state" is not a flexible topic  fire is hot and racism is bad<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Isabelle_Sorto @Mizukage1897818 Current closing manager is thicker than oatmeal plus the "talk" we had as partners stressing me out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you want a break from the news of police brutality and state sanctioned violence you should watch "One Piece" which is about police brutality and state sanctioned violence but is way more fun to deal with than a twitter feed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God, I'm turning this 2020 around if it kills me! Got some cool news and good opportunities ahead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelAZekas have you been to some of these? I figured you'd love this thread!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that Marissa had to ACTIVELY tell non-black people to stop submitting to this says a lot rn. I've seen this woman hold different open submissions all through out the year for so many different actors of different backgrounds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarianneDHobbit YOU NEVER TOLD ME SAURON WAS HOT???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thotcore @ManiiMade I know this is hard to see especially since we've been begging white and non black people to have these uncomfortable discussions about race for years. Now they are in public in full view of black people on social media resulting in us also being apart of the uncomfortable talk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DJohnsonVA Holy shit D I'm so sorry man. I'm wishing you the best in this time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need you all to pray for me here at work<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SheaFontana @childishgamzeno I'm working on a pitch and my first spec script for a pilot! It's my first time writing for animation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gkbowes @BenjaminDiskin @DevenOClock @TheRock knowing you were the voice actress did help me understand that choice a lot more. And i had no clue that Gori's lines were re-recorded. I was afraid i was over sensitive to the issue due to living in the deep South but I'm glad other people shared their concerns as well!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anairis_q @BenjaminDiskin @DevenOClock @gkbowes Thanks Anaris you put it into words better than I could at the moment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjaminDiskin @DevenOClock Ben thanks for the clarification on BZ . My mom and aunts speak like that too it felt really hurtful at the time hear that voice come out of a gorilla something that a black people were compared to for a long time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It might not have occurred to you that Gori's casting and voicing was overtly racist And I did love Gori's character a lot before the dub made HER explicitly black<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With no THOUGHT as how that might read to a black audience I haven't watched a single season of that show since cause it felt so hurtful to see a black woman portrayed that way If you don't know the historical significance of black people being compared to monkeys or apes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KonczakAnna @Minybeats_VA Sure thing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KonczakAnna @Minybeats_VA Hi! I'm Matt Sinclair and here's my demo  https://t.co/14f0PiifYe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McTricky @DevenOClock It made me stop watching the show all together. I couldn't do it knowing BZ made that choice and Sanrio let it air<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DevenOClock Dude i will never forget how disgusted i felt watching the BZ dub of aggressko and hearing the Gorilla character speak Ebonics Knowing that was an active choice BZ made unironically 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WyssJohann @neonkitty1216 @AnnaKendrick47 Imma need you to explain how walking around visibly armed to thee teeth ain't a threat<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CraigB96 @nataliealund "Looting and destroying property is bad unless it's to stop people from looting or destroying property" This is what we mean when we say you're conditioned to respect violence from the state<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GabeKunda I always notice but I never say...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lutes @billprady Do you believe the FCC should let people air child porn on PBS kids and that i should be able to go on CNN to report you smell like 40 year old expired raisin brand? Do you swear in front of everyone you ever come in contact with?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FortWorthReid It's been a really tough week watching this unfold so I'm really happy to see my fellow voice actors being supportive in these times. Thanks Dallas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lutes @billprady Just like being banned from the movie theater for yelling fire is censorship it's still fair. Private companies don't have to put up people abusing free speech. Even if it's the leader of the free world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lutes @billprady I'm certain some libertarian or your father has told you "censorship is bad" but that's only in certain contexts. Trump being fact checked is censorship but he is a public official who's spread misinformation in the past on a private platform he is subject to censor. it's fair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sebasti35523421 @SpeedWeedon @CosmonautMarcus A democracy that stops letting murderers walk just cause they have a badge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lutes @billprady You were ready to debate this point as long as you could keep shifting the goal post of the meaning of censorship what you weren't ready was the nigga who got a perfect score on her AP government test to tell you your freedoms come with responsibilities and consequences<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lutes @billprady you haven't responded to to my other points Drew I'm starting to suspect you're debating in bad faith<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lutes @billprady For some unknown reason what you are actually angry about is Trump is being held accountable via censorship after repeatedly abusing first a. Rights on a private platform<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lutes @billprady Censorship as a punishment after abusing the first a. Isn't dystopian it's how we make ourselves accountable for what we say<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lutes @billprady Yes! And if the lies are harmful hateful etc. You can report them to twitter and twitter will review the tweet. If they find the claim to be true they'll take the tweet down on your behalf. How many people do you think reported Trump's tweets?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lutes @billprady In fact you advocating that twitter shouldn't post a link to facts at the end of Trumps tweets is you wanting twitter to censor themselves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lutes @billprady The censorship you're worried about typically comes before this point but twitter let Trump say whatever he wanted on this private platform true or untrue they let it stand for 5 years. This isn't a slippery slope to book burning this is a reasonable consequence for lying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lutes @billprady They can put posters with the man's face up in the Lobby that read "this man lies about fires" and again that is censorship after the amendment has been abused. If the guy yells fire somewhere else and no one takes him seriously cause of the posters it's his punishment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lutes @billprady Not to mention the first Amendment protests civilians from government retribution it doesn't protect governments from civilian critique Trump is a government official (unfortunately) on a private platform<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lutes @billprady If a man yells "fire" in a crowded theater when there is none and then the theater bans that man from the grounds, you're correct that is censorship the theater is censoring that man but they are in their rights to do so because that man has caused harm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lutes @billprady i won't even argue that it's censorship peep this fam: 45 violated his first amendment rights by telling folks to drink bleach and opened up twitter to potential law suit twitter is actually now perfectly within their rights to censor him on their platform<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So now you see that cops will violate black people's first amendment rights on LIVE NATIONAL TELEVISION<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CrimsonMargrave @citronlad @GhettoBoxMan It's only political because white people made it political.

<|startoftext|>@Sebasti35523421 @icyjiubnext @SpeedWeedon @CosmonautMarcus The reason why is because in the 70s the US began singing MLK's praises while doing very targeted propaganda against the panthers along with violently disbanding them. The panthers were arming people legally and the US was afraid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarrieSchuster7 @GhettoBoxMan See you get it. No one seems to understand the government who is "assisting" poor people built the system that made them poor in the first place<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@A1chemica1 @SpeedWeedon @CosmonautMarcus Collin tried y'all called him UnAmerican when justice runs out peace runs out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeedWeedon @CosmonautMarcus yes because since there is not justice because the cops are killing people then there is no peace from people who don't want to be killed anymore it's a very simple motto easy to understand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GhettoBoxMan my government has treated me and my people like second class citizens, redline us into low income housing flood our communities with drugs and choke us out and you the unmitigated gall to say "I hate poor people"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GhettoBoxMan I do worry about not having a job, you know what else I worry about? Being gunned down as an unarmed black woman and my murderer getting off cause he had a badge No justice No peace a man is dead<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When I left @StarMan_Studios their non actor African american staff went to zero I constantly worry at shows I see if look like I'm fitting in I don't wish to be perceived as an outsider as a threat at any event cause all it takes is once just ONCE and it's all over. It's hellish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I worry about my space in voice acting, I'll be in a class, workshop or event, and I might be the only black person there, @PuddleKanono might be with me but it's not the same. I feel like an outsider, an intruder I worry I fear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We didn't speak for 15 minutes after the argument I felt bad for expecting him to know arbitrary rules of thumb black people have to learn to survive. I shouldn't have, this it the nightmare I live. This is the ever present terror in my life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kim was certain that always explaining yourself prevails. But we were two black women in a dark slow moving car in the mid evening in a suburb in Lewisville. We know how that can be spun we've seen it be done before<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was an older white man who came out of the house around our second or third circle. He seemed to be suspicious of us but Kim was getting frustrated so stopped to ask him for directions. We pleaded with him not to, he didn't understand why we were freaking out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once @PuddleKanono and I got into a fight because we got lost in a wealthy neighborhood visiting friends. It was night time and Kim's car is dark colored we we driving slow and in circles cause we couldn't find our friend's house @anairis_q can vouch this story<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How do I audition for projects when one day a cop having off shift can strip me of everything? How am I supposed to laugh with friends, go to work, find time to love and be loved when my life can be taken by people who won't face charges? How do I continue?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every blue lives matter sign I see in wealthy neighborhoods makes me infuriated, every thin blue line bumper sticker makes me want to slam the gas. It was never about them my people are being killed in the streets and you all turn to hero worship their murderers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every time I see a cop the only thing in my mind is "It could be me, I could be the hashtag" it could be my mother my aunts my siblings endless terror in every direction because police officers service the status quo of inequality happily viciously<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's getting tiresome at this point I don't talk about the shootings and beatings cause even I can't stand to hear about them for two long their grousome and awful and I have to live the horror of knowing "I could be next"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>with incidence like #GeorgeFloyd I feel like I can't stress enough that these never leave our minds. We're sort of expected to soldier on in the face of this. Work for the people who believe that nothing on the video was incriminating<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarianneDHobbit I promise you won't regret it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently I've been trapped in this place for 11 years which is both impressive and depressing to learn #MyTwitterAnniversary  https://t.co/lzJVjpRCK7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoSay_Audio Woah this is sick!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BelRusapeVO Congrats bel! This character looks awesome love the design<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarianneDHobbit It's never a bad time for wind waker memes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrendanBlaber Idk Brendan i remember the disappointment i felt watching the trailer for sticker star and color splash this doesn't give me those vibes and it looks like the brought back some of the classic battle mechanics I'm optimistic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They brought back the theater style battles I'm so full of love for this game #PaperMarioTheOrigamiKing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NintendoAmerica Y'ALL I'M SO HAPPY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OH BABY I ALWAYS KNEW YOU'D COME BACK HOME TO ME #PaperMarioTheOrigamiKing  https://t.co/YH1NrppC2n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Freddie_Heinz I nearly had an aneurysm doing this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Newdo Firday! Got dreads for the summer! What do y'all think? Kim's working on a beat in the background lol  https://t.co/2ariudqYDb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarianneDHobbit @PuddleKanono Out like a light  https://t.co/3dlAnL1SSv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PuddleKanono fell asleep on the floor and when I tried to wake him he just said "Superman comes to terms with himself" hello????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As for tags @GlimmerGremlin @NMZuka @MarianneDHobbit @MiraShiver @BelRusapeVO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5 facts 5 tags  1 I studied dance for 4 years 2 I used to speech write competitively 3 I've been writing poetry and prose since middle school 4 my mom aunt and granny are all trained vocalists 5 I write erotica under a pen name (pls don't try and find me)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're working on some stuff that might seem a little outta character for me but I wanna preference that with I absolutely hate driving and their is a deep dark void within me that has been waiting scream<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PuddleKanono and I have been spending the week creatively! Kim's making beats and I'm writing lyrics it feels good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelAZekas Ah be they ever so humble there's no place like my home states<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's so goddamned funny to me that Sony tried to usurp the theater industry years ago with that unfunny "The Interview" movie by releasing it straight to streaming but the movie that's actually gonna do it is a cute animated film about respecting other's differences<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMullenixVO Such pretty green eyes! Congrats on a cutie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PONZUxPONZU I almost never see human Adam fan art! This is so sweet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess the take away for all this is that if your a #voiceactor and you're feeling down about not booking enough or not being good, remember you're also a storyteller and you have so many ways to tell the story you want to tell! Don't be discouraged if one way doesn't work out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which leads to the third most brilliant thing, I'd still be a storyteller! I'd keep writing and telling stories people can enjoy! I'd still share story concepts with friends and family, and I'd still develop characters, I'd still keep working<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The second brilliant thing is because I'd never know I'd keep trying, and I'd keep getting better and I'd keep having the same friends and trying for rolls and failing and getting better, making new friends! Being a better actor would make me a stronger storyteller<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I thought "If I was doomed to never book a roll ever again" or "If I never booked a big dream roll" what would happen?   And the first brilliant thing I realized is that I'd never know if those things are true till I got to the end and by then I have to worry about other stuff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Flash forward to now, I'm up at 3 am thinking about what a failure I am as you tend to do in your twenties and I do thing therapists always to tell you to do when you're panicking about things you can't control, which is to consider what is the worst that can happen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At that point I hadn't been voice acting very long at all but I'd spent all of my life telling stories! Writing fanfiction, making terrible OCs and strange AUs and even some very bad original concepts so I was like hearing #voiceacting had been waiting for me all along<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know that's like the opposite of the motivational thing people like to say but hear me out, in my first ever voiceover class Joel McDonald I believe brought up that you become an actor because at heart you're a storyteller and that was amazing to hear for me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess cause I'm getting closer to 30 I'm having adult revelations all of a sudden, a big one I had recently about #voiceacting was If I never booked another role ever again in life or if I never got a big role I've been dreaming of I'd honestly be totally fine I wouldn't die<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm at that stage of writing where i sit and stare at a unchanged word document for 3 hours and then cry about how I'm a fraud for 4 hours, so I've been voice acting and sketching as alternatives but dang i just wanna write and I can't make it happen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me at the start: Perms are bad for me anyway! Having to take a break during quarantine won't kill me!   Me now: Everytime i try to comb through my hair the comb breaks. My hair scarf doesn't stay on at night cause it knows there's no point. I am all new growth we are one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anairis_q Yo awesome! I've been looking forward to seeing nessa's episode! I'm so excited to know that it's you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bithalo3d Oh! Cool I'll send an audition in!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>doomer liberals acting like it's such a travesty that they have to pick between one crazy old man over the other in this election like that isn't what POC, LBGTQ, and women HAVEN'T already been doing this for ages each election cycle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I only got 3 characters from the voice acting challenge thing! Please send me more so I can flesh it out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like I know if I focus on drawing I can get better over time, just hearing where I was a year ago as compared to where I am now #voiceacting wise and even to when I started I got into it is pretty big motivation for me to try to get better at drawing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm getting back into practicing art and sketching cause I got nothin better to do at home right now I'm really out of practice, but it's a shame not to put this powerful gaming laptop to work so I'm thinking about doing art streams where you listen to me ramble and draw bad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know why game theory ever focused on Mario or princess peach cause the most obvious nintendo character who has something screwy going on the head is Samus Aran. She watched her parents get murdered by a dragon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey hey! It's ya girl Matt Sinclair and here's my animation #voiceover demo for 2020! #voiceacting #voiceoverartist      https://t.co/GbLfkXtME0  A huge thanks as always to the audio engineering supreme (and man of my dreams ♥️) @PuddleKanono for helping me put this together<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MobPsychoOne @KatyaTalks why am i cryin in the quarantine right now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Freddie_Heinz Hey man, I'm right there with you. Kim and I just said good bye to my old man Shadow last Sunday. It's tough man I offer my support in this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ARunner1996 The movie decided to take all that fun cursed energy from the first movie and up it to 12 and it's fantastic and has a very good grasp of the genre of music it wants to talk about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarianneDHobbit The funnier bits obviously went to other actors but I still loved their bits! My favorite was the rock sweat drop and and the country western tear drop<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man #trollsworldtour really stepped up the soundtrack from the first movie! I was always neutral to "Can't Stop the Feeling"  but I've been listening to "Don't Slack" for weeks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Got some not great news...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PuddleKanono Quarantine is going great<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm downloading #AnimalCrossingNewHorizons as we goddamn speak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>yo no grand standing If you ain't treating trans people with fucking decency and respect in the year of our lord 2020 then you can kick fucking rocks and choke! And no I am not accepting criticism at this time #TransIsBeautiful<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Seeing the end of #StevenUniverseFuture has only strengthened my resolve to try and make my own show. #StevenUniverse has been such a special show to me over the years and now I'm looking forward to making my own projects<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do I have the time to write and finalize the pilot of my show now that we're on lockdown?   Yes! Is that what I'm doing right now? ...No  So I'm opening the floor! Friends and fellow content creators DM or discord message me question about the project I'm working on!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CoryJPhillips @jameswicks @HyperHylianProp damn this is cool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"DragonBall Durag" is such a deceptively funky soul sounding song you'd almost think it's from the golden era of funk and soul in the 70s which is impressive for a song called "DragonBall Durag"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listen I served a lot of elderly customers before my company opted to shutdown. Many thought the panic for corona was over hyped, and all I can think about now is what if while they were telling me this I was exposing them.  It's terrifying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMullenixVO oh, he doesn't look excited for this adventure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@freakyonmain I adore her!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not saying i still believe in biblical style plagues but it's funny how #COVID19 is just really laying bare all the evils of capitalism this country suffers from.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You ever violate quarantine and die of a virus you could have avoided just to own the libs? #DieForTheDow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone in a while I'll bring up a funny audio post I used to laugh at on #tumblr and @PuddleKanono will sucker punch me with a "Oh I made that."<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PuddleKanono and I are making groceries for the lock down. Meanwhile i still have an appointment with a dietitian<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GlimmerGremlin Pix i love that you're making a coat of arms<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well now that I'm at home for the foreseeable future, I guess it's a good time to brand myself like never before!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So it's official. My job is closed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These are the customers i have to deal with while actively exposing myself to being infected with #Covid19usa I would actually rather deal with the virus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I woman came in to the store yesterday and cause we didn't get her drink ready fast enough cause we were helping other customers she called my shift manager a slut and accused her of being too busy 'walking around with dick in her hand' to make her black tea right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to get a medal of honor for continuing to serve lattes to all the Karens of the area while the world crumbles. The movie that make about my heroics will move people to tears and win 30 Oscars. I do it all for every Karen violating social distancing to get soy blonde SKVLs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once global climate change gets into swing it's probably gonna cause some new political philosophies at the forefront of the zeitgeist anyone spouting that kind of philosophy should not be given power<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listen I really need all of the people who follow me to know that saying stuff like "humans are a plague" and "our over population is killing earth" is eccofacism cause you're implying there needs to be a lot less humans for earth to survive and implies a culling/genocide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FortWorthReid Oh Domcamatic! That's actually my favorite gorillzas song cause it introduced me to the r&amp;b artist Daley (the guy in the submarine)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benbevoicing Ah so this is how they make cat people? Interesting process<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmschaff Not saying that elitism isn't definitely at play but why weren't all these concerns brought up when tom hanks announced he was positive?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmschaff Listen i know you probably mean well but it's just funny when an American white actor mentions they tested positive we were worried. But when the black British actor who's in a country where the test is covered by public health care mentions he's positive now it's elitism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevinDThelwell @PuddleKanono No kev you mean everything  https://t.co/yrDB1CUnfr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndreaR9Md So what you're telling me is that American ingenuity isn't dead it's just smothered by capitalism all the time<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Swiftwidget Omg that's perfect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Swiftwidget I always love reading your #bnha breakdowns swift! This is good! I know they'd be great friends and bond over hero stuff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright real talk. Who'd win in a streetfight? #Deku or #Milesmorales<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A #BernieWarren2020 would knock that orange dumb ass out of office so fast please Lizzie if you're listening....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drowzydruzy Nah. The Archie comics at no point ever got more serious than an episode of Scooby doo so it was weird to see heavier half assed concepts introduced into that world. In Castlevania you have to stop a genocide from happening. Heavier concepts fit right at home with that setting<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FourEcchiTasty I make the butcher analogy in reference to another amazing piece of satire "A Modest Proposal" a short story about eating poor children so they don't over populate their country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FourEcchiTasty I think of it this way, a butcher who's really great at cutting the best pick of meats would also be great at dismembering someone and serving them as steak   Which is to say South Park is really good at picking apart topics humorously but they want always punching up<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>As a result of me working opens over closings I now have a lot more time for meal prep! I of course have a healthy repertoire of Southern dishes to pull from but I could always use more! If y'all have any interesting dinner ideas I'd love to hear them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LawrenceSeetoh @OttoLontra On day I said I was feeling tired to a customer and she pulled the "wait till you have kids then you'll really be tired" line so I deadass looked her in the eyes told her i was tired from crying all night cause my friend's funeral was that day and i couldn't get the shift covered<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yeah being fired ain't a great feeling but I've straight up not told y'all I've been putting together a pilot for a show for the last 5 months or so with some amazing people helping me so a huge thanks to @LuciaLobosvilla and @KnightMiniature for all the work you've done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SithingerVA Thanks Justin! I'm just gonna keep moving forward<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AleksLeVO These are fuckin sending me aleks holy shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to keep working hard too so don't you worry about me! So I'm sighing off for the last time #VOheroes Best of luck!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've I had so much fun talking and interacting with you all over the past few months! And I wish the best to Starman and all their employees. I want you all to keep working hard to access the galaxy of opportunities before you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This happened as a result of Kim Morton's departure from the studio as well. While I would have preferred to get a say in whether or not I wanted to stay with company, I do understand the logic that by my connection to Kim it wouldn't have been wise to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey #VOheroes! I'm sad to say that today @StarMan_Studios  has decided that they are no longer in need of my services for social media. I will no longer be manning the Starman Studios twitter, facebook, or tumblr effective immediately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man I can't believe Kobe is just gone...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ciberbarroco @LarissaFae @SaliWho welll there are other phrases like "same-sex wedding" or "Saphic wedding" all that express the two parties are women or the same sex without implying they're both lesbians even the more common colloquial "gay wedding" wouldn't imply they're both lesbians<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IndieWire @ambitiousBard Everyone and their mom knew luke was going to die in that movie you know what would've challenged fans having him survive you know what would have challenged fans? Having a black male jedi be a main character in a major franchise like this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's catering to fans and then their's the half assed subversive writing and plotting that Rian put in the last jedi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMullenixVO I've told you many of times you're a great actor but you're an even better friend who gives fantastic advice and you're saint for putting up with the chaos Kim and i bring to your life<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tentaclehyena Nah man your heart is in the right place. It's hard to imagine how even having a pool of characters you can identify with compared to lighter skin characters who seem near infinite amounts and are always in public view<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMullenixVO No more grubhub for you! Now you can go get lunch like a real man!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tentaclehyena @undead_spartan @Kemdizzzle One Piece, the world's best selling manga, had different ethnic coded MAIN CHARACTERS in the 90s, and I'll admit the first games are based in Japan so fair not a lot diversity in that one but newer games are based in other places these days<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tentaclehyena @undead_spartan @Kemdizzzle Black people "it would be nice if one of the largest media properties of the 20th and 21st century made more of a point to acknowledge other races more often since kids around the globe play it"   You the absolute genius "they don't even have black people in Japan"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@undead_spartan @Kemdizzzle if we're going by character that proportion gets worse. you can probably easily count the number of dark skinned Pokemon/ black characters as compared to light skinned/ "white" pokemon characters who'd be EVERYONE ELSE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kemdizzzle OP said Nessa was the first black trainer they'd seen which going by number of darker skinned gym leaders to fair skinned gym leaders is wholly possible especially if darker skin leaders weren't pushed in the marketing and this person hasn't played<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylesky3 It's cool. racism is hard to understand by design. It keeps it's power that way. I'm not judging this person as bad but ignorance can cause harm for others if not addressed. Adam's true sin was failing to inform Eve of the command not to eat the apple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylesky3 Remember this well: black on black crime and gang formation is not a justification of or a trump card to 300 years of human suffering and continued systemic problems but rather a near direct result of those things<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylesky3 Your misunderstanding is a simple one, you see racism as a thing that is done, which is true racist actions do exist, but racism is also a system of cause and effect that permeates through the society<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylesky3 Which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ‘I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action- MLK jr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylesky3 I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Councilor or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to ‘order’ than to justice; who prefers a negative peace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylesky3 Fun! What racist slang is there in US english that exist for white people that envoke 300 of the worst years in human history? Just wanna know so I don't say it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NMZuka I love this take on this great boy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulsRockinTwit Thanks paul!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LuciaLobosvilla The tangled dvd is the gold😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarianneDHobbit @PuddleKanono @TMullenixVO Yeah! I'm glad that worked out. I'm wondering about the other people who were trying to get in. There were a line of cars around the corner trying to wait the police out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actual image of Travis letting us stay over last night  https://t.co/B23Ub97ANH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So if you're wondering how last night shook out for @PuddleKanono and I, @TMullenixVO is the best and let us crash at his place. The cops are gone and our general conscious is that there was a pretty bad accident where someone was hurt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#voiceactress #voiceacting #vo ive been awake for 15 god forsaken  hours and now the cops are keeping us from entering @PuddleKanono apartment complex so I can know something close to peace. Advice and memes greatly appreciated #VOheroes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NMZuka I legit wanna see how many times you tweet about your wife before he catches on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NMZuka Nah... Let it be a surprise<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NMZuka GROWING BOY! HE NEEDS HIS NUTRITION!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@audiblyyours @StarMan_Studios @JenAlyx Thanks! There's almost too much talent in this movie!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NMZuka Thanks Zuka! I'm so glad i get to talk about this now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm proud of all the hard work i watched these amazing people put in and even prouder to call them colleagues and friends. So while I am happy for my first movie I'm even happier I get to share all the amazing things I watched the starman crew do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yo! I'm proud to announce my motion picture debut! You can hear me in the English dub of #TheDivineFury thanks so much to @StarMan_Studios and @JenAlyx for having me and a huge shot out to the rest of supremely awesome cast!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heybiji Imagine it being finals week and having a horde of hatterenes crowded at your window as try to finish a paper you should have had done hours ago<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Isis_Kain The mood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That person was probs just concerned about my mental health, and truth be told that morning i wasn't in the best place mentally but i can guarantee you that talk did not help<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like to eximplfy exactly why #capitalismishell, last week a person told my manager i looked depressed and i got reprimanded in the back room also my ability to do my job well enough to keep it was called into question<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@j_nicold @Joshua4Congress Well if you don't believe in aca how about this, every cooperation that failed this woman has to be charged with manslaughter. Insulin is like 30 pennies to buy for any other animal. You can go to walmart right now and ask for some for your dog. This mark up is killing people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarianneDHobbit @MarkAllenJr You can also report them 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrinceSk8er Wow so like every one here i do agree you're terrible but i just wanna do everyone a solid and remind them that saying someone deserved to come to harm for not following directions counts as reason to report this tweet as harassment. Have fun kids!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@troubledmn I thought this was universal constant not a hot take<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaiManAlex Dude that looks dope!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KylePhillipsFUN @PuddleKanono @ChrisLongVO @JakeHabermanVA @StarMan_Studios It was a lot of fun! And i learned a lor about what i need to focus on as a voice actress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YellowFlashGuy I gotta give it up to people who find new and creative ways to rub salt in this wound great job<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't like this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NMZuka Be safe dude! I'll keep you in my thoughts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kiwichi04 Aw thank you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisWehkamp There is something very cool about being able to still be mostly anonymous on tumblr and follow special interests with like minded people in peace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two natural disaster videos!? Watch me meance gamer chad and @TMullenixVO with some help from @CoryJPhillips @PuddleKanono and @JoshuaPassmore1 in these two new cartoons for @Smash_Bits   https://t.co/arMlLBTDOx   https://t.co/S602TVkDqJ  It was fun to be an absolute hindrance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LostBlueJay Yo I love this! Your art is like something I've been missing all this time. Keep up the great work<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shinden9 What you actually care about in this situation is the sense of superiority you get from listening to acting you may or may not be able to understand (i mean no one speaks English the way they do in TV shows out loud same for Japanese)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shinden9 What I'm trying to illustrate is that you don't actually care about this. People who care study Japanese to become translators or study linguistics and communications to become localizers or train in theatre to become voice actors. You can change the reality but don't<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shinden9 If you really believe Jamie and funimation are conspiring to put content in shows that don't belong, aren't you concerned about fans who have disabilities and have to watch dubs? They aren't getting the true experience you could contact the creator if you actually gave a damn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shinden9 I mean bad dubs are bad dubs. But aren't you saying Jamie is pushing an agenda? What did she do? What show did it happen in? Or are you one of those people who don't believe in localization and think idioms should be translated word for word with no context?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hardcpy @Shinden9 What did she put in a dub that you'd literally contact the right holder's over? If it's really that terrible we can walk through the steps you need to contact right holders to inform them of misuse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shinden9 And how much are you going to pay a translator and lawyers to get in contact with these studio's legal departments to accuse Jamie and funimation of the very serious charge purposefully using the rights of a show outside their original contracts?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shinden9 Ok I'll bite. What absolutely story ruining immersion breaking completely unrealistic thing did Jamie put in a show that's so terrible that the original right holders have to bwecontacted about outside of their continuous communication with funimation through lawyers?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mizukage1897818 Be strong serg!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PuddleKanono Funney<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shinden9 It's hilarious y'all saying "this is why a watch subs" but when the creators of Zombieland Saga conformed lilly was trans i remember y'all accusing Japan of pandering. Lol just admit you hate minorities and go. don't make this complicated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone who votes pluto is indirectly cucking me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisGuerreroVA Ooof! Hope you're alright and doing well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This picture was taken shortly after i had chocolate covered bacon and a funnel cake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like good for y'all for being woke all of a sudden but I'm really in my feelings right now #Facebook #voiceacting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listen fam, as an actress i was pressured FOR YEARS to get a facebook for professional reasons despite my objections to the site and it's info gathering. Now I finally HAVE TO make one to manage a responsibility and all y'all have suddenly realized I was right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GodswillUgwaJr You can't tell me with some of these current anime titles there aren't some very talented show runners blazing it up. Life finds a way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ma'am I'm a barista, not a coffee alchemist. I can't just make something exist because you say it should. Now would you like your milk steamed or no?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarMan_Studios I can let you know right now @PuddleKanono are gonna play cuphead for Switch all weekend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PuddleKanono You may... Give pets...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please give me treats I'm doing so good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaiManAlex @NazeehTarsha Yeah I'm like 3 Rottweilers with a fashion sense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@msnz_04 This man spilt hot buffalo sauce in my lap and i told him "thank you"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NMZuka God.... Is that you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PuddleKanono I love you in ridiculous amounts and i want everyone possible to know how much i love you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was a kid when Katrina hit my home town in Mississippi. It was scary, i felt like my community had been abandoned to the storm. My town has never really recovered and i still hold that man responsible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Being in love is wild. Like I'll wake up to @PuddleKanono face in the morning and he'll say something real funny that i repeat for the rest of the day. That's our relationship and it makes me so happy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisGuerreroVA Your costume last night was great<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyway how's everyone else's #SaturdayMorning ?  #SaturdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And your company uses the "lean and mean" staffing method to ensure just enough people are there so the place doesn't go up in flames. But because you are wise and kind you continue to soldier on compassionately in a cruel world that only gets more cruel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes you wake up at 5 am to the sound of a loved one in pain and as much as you'd love to stay and comfort them you still have to go to work and get talked down to by customers while you wonder if you left them to die cause it was far too late to call out (1/2)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryVanceVA You've missed the point friend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ambitiousBard Why nick? Is Will there? Is holding you hostage?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anairis_q today I was possessed by the spirit of hot takes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Trying to get back into a balence of work vs. Social life is hard. You can't be around as much because you have to be up early or miss out on events while at work. Especially when you have conflicting schedules<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@al_weapon_1 @BafienMorin @prooffreader @Joshua4Congress most people only have basic understanding of their bodies but when something is wrong you go to a doctor don't you? You defer to an expert the expert gives you an opinion and you act thusly well the experts gave their opinions have been for a long time now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SoulAtSolstice @prooffreader @Joshua4Congress You're not special for being able to use correct punctuation and grammar on twitter. The fact that you can't seem to differentiate when to use more common efficient language vs. your ideals of "correct English" shows your lack of ability of basic code switching.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@exitwombs @prooffreader @Joshua4Congress See what happens is a bunch of people (not just one) get together and support or form organizations that want to make a change.

<|startoftext|>@MaiManAlex @benbevoicing @DashCruzVA @BrittanyLaudaVO @MattShipmanVO @baugusbryson I legit don't talk to @PuddleKanono about this cause i do really love five guys but he hates it and sometimes you take an L for love plus 5G is real expensive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@prooffreader @Joshua4Congress Like i personally don't have to sit around and do nothing to ensure future generations also die<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@prooffreader @Joshua4Congress Like yeah i get it there's a very real chance we'll fail, just like there was a very real chance we were all gonna die in a nuclear holocaust during the cold war or a very real chance we'd never make it to space but lying on your back and giving up just makes the failure certain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@prooffreader @Joshua4Congress If i give up fighting though i might as well die now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@prooffreader @Joshua4Congress Listen fam i know you're being the edgy "human's deserve what's coming" but i need you to understand the people who'll be hurt by this crissis first will be the people who never even got a say and i refuse to die because of billionaire dictating my fate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SnowyVikingofDC @_Hero_Hei_ Well let's put it this way: act like I've never heard this joke before ever in my life. Why is this funny? I don't get it?  Explain it to me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarMan_Studios I know I'm OP but I just had a rumchata hot chocolate with cinnamon and whipped cream<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SnowyVikingofDC @_Hero_Hei_ Comparing Jamie to her character cause you can only associate a woman's worth and moral standard as person with their physical appearance as it appeals to you? I've never seen that one before! 😉<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Aaron__Dismuke Not an action but if got frozen in the middle of a cycle and woke up to bad cramps and heavy flow in a now tampon and pain killer free world I'd probably go mad for 4 days<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Doctor_Bored By making it art and leaving people to interact with it as a concept people can come to their own conclusions about how terrible and inhumane it is then they can make conclusions about other similar systems already in place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Doctor_Bored Anyone can see that's a terrible idea. That's the point. And if you think some horrible capitalist hasn't come up with a similar comcept for this you're a bit naive to how terrible capitalism can be. The difference is a capitalist would roll this out with positive spin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Doctor_Bored Fam i am a guillotine socialist all day long but i can not stress enough that this is an art installation meant to make middle class people understand the concept of homelessness spikes and how inhumane they are by quantifying it into an experience<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...in the movie and this isn't times she's been poofed (which is probably a higher number than 4 given her masochistic nature with rose quartz) this is full factory reboots. Why has Pearl been reset 3 other times? Maybe season 6 of #StevenUniverse will let us know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not only that but while it says (3) that would actually be the 4th since a computer doesn't start with the initial file being counted the first copy of that file however is denoted with a (1)  that boot file has been copied or accessed 3 other times before the one we see...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What that title mimics is a file name or path but what's interesting is the "(3)"  if you've ever saved multiple of the same file that 3 should look familiar in this context. It's a number the computer assigns the file once multiple iterations are created<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something that @PuddleKanono brought up about the #StevenUniverseMovie. Pearl's song is called "system/BOOT. PearlFinal (3).info" which is a fun refrence to Pearl's computer like nature which has been shown at other points in the show but also brings up a big question<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I listen to a ton of #vaporwave and I started paying more attention the visual and tonal #aesthetic and suddenly it clicked! Ambient synths for mystic temples, and looping party beats for advanced high tech cities also there's giants for #sizetwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I knew I wanted to write a fantasy story with futuristic elements but for some reason it was always hard to get the thing rolling cause I didn't have a clear vision of the world and then!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MMPRblog @CobaltBox2000 @ChannelGrayVEVO @BiscuitBasher Change "trans" to "cis" and you're absolutely right. If a new trans character was added and was just as well written trans people wouldn't be upset but i can promisw a back lash od fans would still say it was forced lgbt content<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisWehkamp @warrenellis Thanks Chris i needed i good cry tonight!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>August nights are filled with a special summer magic. For me tonight's magic was two racoons at the dumpster who had nothing to lose and were ready to square tf up with me and my dog on sight. It was a special moment i certainly won't forget anytime soon ☺😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like a opened a word project to continue writing and my brain just went "Issac Michaels would be Midoriya's localization name" and I got give it credit that certainly stopped me from writing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For some reason I just had the thought "if 4kids dubbed #MyHeroAcademia they'd change Izuku's name to Issac" and that's one of the more distracting thoughts my ADHD has produced<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GothGoblinPix oh no bro are you alright?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hoyleryan The state fair calls you...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KylePhillipsFUN @PuddleKanono I too would love to see more ferral hog representation in the industry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarianneDHobbit @DOGSTRONGG Also while I'll admit that a part of Okabe's character is his sort of oblivious nature to certain boundaries which causes him to push or brush against them that scene is so OUT OF CHARACTER i skip it every rewatch cause it makes me too angry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarianneDHobbit @DOGSTRONGG That one scene in steins;gate where the main character does the classic accidentally fondling someone except it's not an accident<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tie between munshi shi and p4 the animation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarianneDHobbit I mean that all makes sense from a writing stand point but as someone who had a number of bakugou style bullies in school he still comes off as just a dick. I mean i was a dumb cringey kid too but i never had the motivation to be so relentlessly cruel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MiraShiver WHAT IS THE SECRET OF THE FIRE CHILD MIRA?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NMZuka Yeah it really messed with me at the time and i haven't talked about it a lot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey where's that subsect of #gamer culture that turned conservative cause they though feminism was ruining the industry. Look how fast the GOP threw you under the bus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@celestialtabris Yeah people are coping this as a rallying cry when we need to remember this isn't a politician speaking on an issue anymore this is a man speaking from the grief of his community<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thatmightyheart This is Gracepoint erasure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Karkat is more bark than bite but Bakugou has a ton of bite in him with no apparent need to stop please #mha #BNHA fans help me understand what about this kid drives y'all crazy for him cause i am lost #Bakugou<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And if you compare him to Karkat that falls apart too. Karkat is very much an asshole on the most superficial of levels. He comes from a hyper violent society so all of his interactions are actually appropriate and he's actually kind and considerate to his friends<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vegeta's arc works because he was put on the other end of the crap he'd been doling out all those years now he's the one at the mercy of a powerful tyrant. #Bakugou never gets that... He gets traumatized and then the audience is kinda forced to sympathize with him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listen i TO THIS DAY do not understand the sheer mass love #bakugoukatski gets like Vegeta committed galaxy wide genocide and somehow still manages to me more likable than a 14 year old high school student to me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kiriputaku I love a lovable asshole character as much as the next person but Bakugou is so NOT that trope that i am completely mystified as to why so many people like him. He spent most of the canon bullying the main character and never gets a proper comeuppance for it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NMZuka When the shooter incident in Dallas happened a few months back as it was unfolding all i knew was that it was at government building down town.

<|startoftext|>@shiroflcl @toastasaurus @AmandaFlagg If you had a concern about a problem in a media form you care for like video games or anime or what have you and someone told you to "just go outside" would you take that as valid advice?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shiroflcl @toastasaurus @AmandaFlagg Well in telling them to "go outside"  you're meaning is "be quiet and don't think about the problem"  it's a distraction not a solution you have no proof op doesn't go outside and since most people have to interact with the outside world to like LIVE your point is moot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shiroflcl @toastasaurus @AmandaFlagg Sounds like you need to learn some empathy and kindness for people who have different experiences than you being an asshole is the easiest job in the world my dude no one is impressed be better<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@reallifecamacho @Karamo When beto did this during his senate run in Texas it wasn't aimed at spanish speakers who could understand english but spanish speakers who had a harder time understanding english. You've assumed he's trying to impress you instead of trying to show that he's willing to connect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone is calling #Beto pandering for his spanish but that's literally what he did during his senate run? Texas has a large population of spanish speakers who may not have a great understanding of English so he spoke in spanish during speeches in a show of good faith<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some takes...  Know when the joke is over  If someone is engaging in "attention seeking" behavoir give them attention talk with them engage with them  People on the internet are still people   A better world starts with you #EtikaForever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SponsoredByNord @ponettplus @smolfrozenthing there are things  that are more racist yes but that doesn't mean that it's any less important to call them out someone doing mildly racist things can end up doing more racist things later if it's not brought up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man I remember watching that persona 5 video during a not great time and have my first genuine belly laugh in ages and watching streams and clips and videos from there it's surreal to think that #Etika is gone we lost someone really special #JOYCONBOYZFOREVER<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SponsoredByNord @ponettplus @smolfrozenthing even if the object is fake if people paid for the object the scammers are the ones in the wrong not the people who wanted the object being "ironically racist" still is going to hurt black people it doesn't matter if the intention was to hurt someone else<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SponsoredByNord @ponettplus @smolfrozenthing if you know someone is baiting you into a fight by punching you in the face does the fact that it was bait make your nose less broken?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSMonroeShow Ya know a country that has a history of anti black racism and actively promotes skin lightening can't actually be ironic about racism the original artists should have been talked to privately but maybe I'm missing the joke can someone explain why this is funny? I'm just upset<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthewfunnyman @InfernoOmni simple reason why one is okay over the other: white people don't experience an active racism that tries to erase them out of a societal narrative and there's no history of white people being not being a huge part of mainstream media<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PuddleKanono The first person to find the head looses... 😡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>While the first artist should have just be talked to privately about #Nessa's skin color the fact that shit ton of artist decided to protest using OUT RIGHT RACISM shows me people who wanna be terrible don't need much of an excuse #nessapokemon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuuyahasAbigD_ @LittleLiam117 @_Sunset_Red_ @The_Oracle_Folf @saucy_goose @wordsdepleted @Pr0m3theus_SSB @Del0Nova @TheSMonroeShow Oh i was just replying to why that comic up there is a false equivalent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LittleLiam117 @_Sunset_Red_ @The_Oracle_Folf @ChuuyahasAbigD_ @saucy_goose @wordsdepleted @Pr0m3theus_SSB @Del0Nova @TheSMonroeShow The fact that you are misunderstanding the nuances of this on a fundamental level is proof that you've not struggled with a lack of representation in your media and good on you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LittleLiam117 @_Sunset_Red_ @The_Oracle_Folf @ChuuyahasAbigD_ @saucy_goose @wordsdepleted @Pr0m3theus_SSB @Del0Nova @TheSMonroeShow Why would an artist draw a poc character white? There are a ton of other white characters? Why can't they identify with this character as a poc? People of color have been forced to identify with white characters for years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LittleLiam117 @_Sunset_Red_ @The_Oracle_Folf @ChuuyahasAbigD_ @saucy_goose @wordsdepleted @Pr0m3theus_SSB @Del0Nova @TheSMonroeShow Actually the reason why one is okay and not the other is because when a poc draws a white character in their skin tone it's because they're pinning for diversity in a media that lacks it there's no shortage of white characters in mainstream media<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well i hope to see y'all on the other side of this doozy #NBCDFWStorms  https://t.co/4RcPCXa0hN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KylePhillipsFUN What a cool way to do a reveal! Congrats on the new addition and happy father's day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And cause we love nintendo we want to have a dialogue about this tl;dr #Nessa's design is oversexualized on it's on but the latest in a line of skimpy clad dark skinned characters and we just wanna draw attention to this before it gets out of hand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING is trying to call attention to this design trend so the cycle of harmful ideas can stop. Again it's not that nintendo is an evil company. Their art designers have just gotten snagged on a common problem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The designers AREN'T BAD PEOPLE OR ANYTHING they've just fallen into a bit of pit trap with the designs of their characters that does  happen in a society that pushes these stereotypes ironically these designs now also reinforce these harmful ideas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is most likely due to an unchecked internalized bias the designers have. How they subconsciously view darker skin toned people as more exotic and promiscuous which leads to them drawing them in outfits that show their bodies more<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since people aren't getting it #Nessa's design isn't the problem the problem is nessa comes latest in a long line of nintendo's dark skin characters being dressed skimpier than their lighter counterparts #PokemonSwordShield<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@anairis_q yeah me too, another alternative is that it's a muscle spasm<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@stclairashley I don't even know where to to start with this one: the fact that you seem to think only guys get hyped for super heroes and star wars or the fact that you don't think having 8 pockets is the dopest shit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PuddleKanono Correction "WILL leave me for..."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christilford Bisexual and black Voice actress here!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a professional #voiceactress I'll have you all know get very important work done at @StarMan_Studios  #donkeykong #queenofkong  https://t.co/eSEoEZv59n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well I guess this is happening. Hear me as the voice of reason to @MichaelAZekas Lord Plunder aka Francis on #babyalan  https://t.co/Yqnnb7Ojf3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FuckinShitMate @USO_Squad Then that becomes the director casting before seeing an actor's preformance. The job of an actor is to be able to step outside of themselves to fit a roll. In this case the director assumed the flamboyant gay person can't act as anything other than flamboyant that's stereotyping<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Caraboo900 @Jimmy_Sherwood @USO_Squad This also brings up "why was there only one x actor at the audition? Why were more y actors called in to audition for this x roll?"  If 40 guys and 4 girls were called for an audition and a guy got the part is the problem that the 4 girls couldn't act?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USO_Squad You mention Neil Patrick Harris as an example but you forget that Neil was an established child actor before he came out as gay and he landed how i met your mother before he was out as well. He had his foot in the door before his identity could shut him out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USO_Squad What if the best trans actor wasn't even at the audition because they couldn't afford giving their transphobic boss a reason to fire them by taking time off? What if the best gay actor wasn't there cause the casting director finds them too flamboyant and didn't even send an email<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USO_Squad The problem with this is assuming it's a perfect world where actors with marginalized identities don't get passed over for certain rolls to begin with if it was just "the best actor always gets the part" you have to factor in a lot more things than just talent<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BreckinMathias In this capitalism run world can we all stop acting like getting paid for roles doesn't provide some sense of validation/security. You definitely shouldn't get into VO for the money but money is always a factor to any professional<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KinglyRed @Vinesauce I think it comes from the first 2 games perfecting their ability to get the player attached to fun and over the top characters and spm does that and then put emotional weight behind those characters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I learned something insightful today! Even 10 years later from the first time I played it the ending to #superpapermario still makes me cry. Thanks for helping me realize this @Vinesauce<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NMZuka (it's what you deserve)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SithingerVA that's exactly what he did! I was introducing myself shaking hands but keeping things short he followed up right behind me as though we were friends even though we met like a second ago<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SithingerVA He was actually hanging around me because after I'd briefly speak with VAs he'd follow up right behind me and trap them in long conversations It made me feel really bad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SithingerVA Ok at one point I was meeting VAs at an event and was also networking when this guy just came up and started randomly making conversation I thought he was being friendly cause we both went to the event by ourselves but that was not the case<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NMZuka Where can i watch this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me not being social due to rejection dysphoria "Idk i just kinda keep a low profile in the VA community. I don't wanna come off as too clingy or annoying"  Also me that knows networking is important "i have some unfortunate news for you..."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>7 Super Paper Mario has the best writing and story in the series and i hate it when people call it the death of paper mario that game has so much charm and polish with a fun mechanic and a heart wrenching story it's more a touching end to those games than their coffin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>6 this one is spicy but undertale's rapid rise in popularity happened because the homestuck fanbase was starved for content not saying undertale is bad or it never would have become popular but thank homestuck the next time you play this indie game on a triple a console<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like sonic adventure more than I like sonic adventure 2 I have no reason for this...... don't @ me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khenpoe I love projared's approach cause he acknowledges he thought the game was good however there are times in other reviewers who do this act like hipster games who never bought into the "hype" of 'insert beloved title here' and are letting us in on some great secret<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4)Pit is the best modern Nintendo protagonist because of his out spoken and over the top personality not in spite of it stepping into the role of character is fine but being able to relate to a character's traits is even better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3) If Wind Waker came out just 5 years to a decade later it would be held as a bold artistic masterpiece in the franchise instead of a "cult classic" and I really would have loved to see nintendo push that art style and game play further in a another home console installment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2) This trend in game reviews of going back and picking apart older previously known as classic games just to show they aren't as good as you think they are is boring and just a way for the game reviewer to stroke their ego "see critically acclaimed title has some deep flawsss"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welp here come seven deadly horrible hot takes  I like themes of confronting the true self in Persona 4 better than I like themes of facing your own death in persona 3 it always comes off as sadness porn to me<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@baybonfleek @HIDEJI_CO @vannneal1 @diannaeanderson I think the concept works better like this say how much a person works can be a number let's use 7 for instance now you can work twice as hard as some one else or five times as hard or even 20 times as hard but there's no way humanly possible you can work a billion times more<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KinglyRed Yeah and the main thing the gods help him do is fly. If Pit could fly on his own he'd be nigh unstoppable.   To recap kirby is a baby who will kill gods over literal spilled milk  Pit is more or less a weapon/mercenary used by the gods to kill other gods  Both are precious<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Therapy is great cause every once in a while I'll find my brain doing something stupid unhealthy and I'll be like "Wait! Crystal taught me how to deal with this!" and I do it and my brain stops! Why do we demonize it again? #FridayThoughts<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SarahRuthVoice I would love that and i do also love that song on it's own lion king 2 is an underrated sequel!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahRuthVoice I love it as a foil to scar's song in the original.Scar knows what he's doing is wrong. Zira is constantly painting herself as the victim in her story and her revenge is what she is owed it really shows off her twisted world view plus calling a mournful howl a lullaby? Iconic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarianneDHobbit @GothGoblinPix it's a struggle 🙃<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>2 o'clock and finishing up shopping i know i need to get to the mall before everyone is off of work but at the same time i super don't wanna go...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kimleesi this made me laugh so hard a coworker had to check on me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CheyenneYoutube It took me a while before i realized dragon ball z had become such a point of culture for younger black people when i got my first DB audition I cried when I told my cousins about it later we cried together none of the older relatives could even fathom it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryVanceVA You can do it! Just remember to breathe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NMZuka (Fair i was out after season 3 I've been hurt too many times before.)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Gamerben111 @BazookaShark517 @SlayerSyrena Or maybe you like a girl with more rounded features like glimmer  https://t.co/JAVvgU66gu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gamerben111 @BazookaShark517 @SlayerSyrena Women have sharp cheek bones and strong jaws it's just so under represented in media you don't know how to react to it the other girls in the show have faces you're used to like mermista here  https://t.co/oTNRhQV9Dm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BazookaShark517 @SlayerSyrena So your complaint is that she looks to similar to another character? The orginal she-ra had all the ladies suffer from same face syndrome while this iteration has adora and her fellow princesses havr unique faces and body styles or are you mad you can't jerk it to ben 10?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NMZuka i love you for this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@splendidland it was one thing for him to be racist but it was a sharp kick to the gut to watch everyone rally around him despite his racism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@splendidland diepie is racist and i have had to legit blacklist and unfollow other gamers for supporting him. Like it was such a slap in the face to e a black woman and have other people you like support an awful human who uses a word that dehumanizes you and your race<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SlayerSyrena ok but I know women and girls who look like this sometimes women have powerful jaws? if your complaining about the thick eyebrows that's something I've seen used with blond characters so their eyebrows can be used for conveying emotion what is your concern break it down for me?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like my main hold back is that you'll be missing the energy of the adrenaline rush of preforming on stage in front of people also the second one was mostly improv but I want to do it for posterity sake #TuesdayMotivation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been thinking about re-recording my #nowvoicethis3 live performances from #animedallas to show you lovely folks what I actually did... would y'all be down for that? It's of course gonna be more polished than it was live #TuesdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MiraShiver awww ari's such a lorge lady now! 🥰<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NMZuka (❤️❤️ take it easy friend rest and ice it it down see if that helps)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I loved you no matter what the haters said...✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ericalindbeck technically speaking I think pantone does classify gray and grey as slightly different colors with different hex values<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well it's been a wild Friday! full of cool announcements! Looking forward to get Smash later today!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PeanutButterGmr Also should be mentioned tho tumblr is banning porn you can still easily find pro-nazi blogs on their site right now guess that's SFW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anairis_q im wearing 3 layers of clothes right now it's complete BS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jacobwilson549 @nowvoicethis Oh i didn't win. I made it to the finals and it came down to a random drawing. I was amazed i made it that far<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You'll just have to enjoy this picture by @Rickyiism and imagine how good i was sounding  https://t.co/0LC90sU9vJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good luck to all the @nowvoicethis finalists! And i regret not having the foresight to record my preformances 😭😮<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I was radio silent through the whole @nowvoicethis live rounds at #animedallas out of fear of jinixing it BUT OH GOSH I'M SO HAPPY I MADE IT AS FAR AS I DID! i wasn't sure I'd make it through round 1 let alone be one of the 7 finalists!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeanutButterGmr A good chunk of Tumblrs user base has been screaming at the staff for years to get rid of cp and other awful blogs. The fact that they only took action after their app got pulled shows this was a business move<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PokemaniacNora Ok fair.... You are goregous Nora and very brave. You do you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PokemaniacNora Point me in their direction so i cam roast them endlessly tomorrow<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CheyenneYoutube Totally understandable fam. Do what you gotta do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NMZuka (Well at least it was just mice. Back when we lived in Mississippi my fam found out it was couple of very onary raccons)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@XanderMobusVO I think Netflix is having to formally let go of the rights to their marvel stuff by cancelling it...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarianneDHobbit @nowvoicethis This is precious!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benbevoicing I'll be there! It'll be great to see you again!😋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mayhem_crimson This is a brilliant gag just for the fact sponge-bob does this literally backwards It's not the the typical process you'd go about doing this so it's "wrong"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jacobwilson549 Yeah! You'll see me around<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jacobwilson549 Nice! Did you take advantage of that sweet amazon sale they had?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>a plus ultra mood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MiraShiver Be the change you wanna see!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listen one my favorite take aways from Sponge bob is how you're never too old to b a kid, to be kind, to expect the best of the world It's a subtle message in the show that no doubt is why I am the way I am now #RIPStephenHillenburg and thanks for making sure we stay kids<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TianaCamachoVO ... I know a studio like that too I love it it gets me peaceful before recording<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NMZuka (Always think i talk to much about myself and that i end up putting people off with that. I'll also forget to reply)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In order to increase my adult sleep over potential and for con emergencies I ordered a queen sized self inflating air mattress! I now also realized that a queen sized air mattress might not be great for limited sized areas but you know it is what it is #FridayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jazuren Yeah! With the exception of like the red dust in the pride rock scene this movie isn't pushing the color scheme enough!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go watch this lady loose her best friends in a nuzlocke!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeeDotally Even though I worked Customer Service I've been lucky enough to work in industries that don't have black Friday sales but it still stands that if I people catch being mean or rude to an employee this black Friday I will talk to them about it so just be cool!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My friends draw cool art and I love them that is all #FridayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listen I don't normally say stuff like this but if I walk into a store this #BlackFriday2018 and see you berating a customer service worker I AM GOING TO STEP TO YOU FAM and this ain't what you want #FridayFeeling<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey there #fanfiction writers! Do you remember the harshest critique you've ever gotten on a story? You know the one that made you feel like you wanted to stop writing forever? Screen shot it and send it to my DMs! I'm starting a little project😉#fanfic #WritingCommunity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's official! I am the proud new owner of a #NintendoSwitch Happy early birthday to me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It should go without saying that I am also #ThankfulFor my deep southern black heritage cause I'll never taste an under-seasoned turkey as long as I can help it! My uncle Bubba is the kitchen right now putting a special rub he calls "the love" on that bird<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's #ThankfulThursday and I can't even begin to count all the things I'm thankful for this year! From new opportunities to new friends and even a new outlook! I'm thankful for everyday I get to be here and experience the world with friends and family!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benbevoicing *sad trumpet noise*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I finally had a podcast idea! That would be a lot of fun to do and shows off a unique skill i have<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had a fun time as per usual recording at @StarMan_Studios yesterday... Jokes shared memories made all that sentimental stuff Can't wait to do it again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MiraShiver uuuuuhh You don't feel safe teaching in the current broken american public education system and I'd be toxic to teach in private knowing that other kids can't afford it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excited for a studio session today! Since I have to walk  from the bus stop to the building I plan on doing all my warming up during that time and offer my deepest apologies to everyone who will hear me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yamyan Jesus Christ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Working at a coffee shop has taught me 3 very important things -near infinite patience -all consuming white hot rage -black coffee drinkers are far more annoying than any pumpkin spice drinker #SundayThoughts<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FortWorthReid Friendlies, personality, kindness something!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I started #SheRa last night and I am loving it so far! Only four episodes in and all the characters are memorable and charming with awesome designs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benbevoicing owning a car is just like that and it sucks sorry dude<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Adding mine in  -Shoujo Protagonist  -An indie visual novel -Something in the one piece franchise  -a dating sim<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>this is why i started watching #angelsofdeath<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RusapeB The secret dreans! I've come real close to one of these though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>someone in the condos close by is having an all out rager complete with a DJ, an MC and lights given how late it's getting and the area we're in I want to see how long it is before someone calls DPD over a noise complaint<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NMZuka Arms was going to be one of the options soley cause i love the art you and @bonkalore draw for it plus the mechanics look fun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok...So I am definitely probably getting a #NintendoSwitch next week What game should I get!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@merrittk This is a fun drag I'll take any day! Had me dead to rights with Wind waker Minish Cap and Breath of the wild<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sonic_hedgehog I can still hear the time limit death...  https://t.co/gXsIG16Ich<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the @sonic_hedgehog tumblr posted about the barrel from Carnival Night Zone and I am now I'm getting heated from flash backs of my first couple of times playing that level.

<|startoftext|>Currently putting my #voiceacting talents to good use by mimicking a cat to lure out a stray kitten<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I took 2 weeks off from auditioning and recording to relax and not gonna lie I'm feeling a lot better now! Sometimes I go so hard a this I do forget the importance of taking a step back to refresh! But now it's time to get back at it #FridayMotivation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes when my hormones are really out of wack and I see a picture of a cute animal I'll just start crying #FridayFeeling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NormMelding well it means going from group chat to a private chat so they may know something is up......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarissaLenti the worst part of this is that I can hear it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to ask someone out... but I am very terrible at the whole "Be romantically sociable" thing I suppose practice never hurt #ThursdayMotivation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yuriofwind Rest up dude! Take as much time as you need!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A woman in a benz cut in front of my bus JUST BARELY not getting crushed cause she realized she wasn't in the turning lane This is like a good 40 percent of the reason why I don't drive in #Dallas #ThursdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No one in this state can drive, I am convinced of this! Every day on the bus I see some jerk ass pull some super unsafe maneuver to do something that could be done with out endangering their life and the lives of others #ThursdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DMargretTurner You just gave me a terrible impulse idea that i'll have to fight off now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FortWorthReid See also "we're not gonna be here long"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Listen I know we're all excited for #DetectivePikachuMovie but I feel like we're glossing over the fact that #ToyStory4 introduced the concept of homunculi toys and that's equally as important as Mr.Mimes weird face #TuesdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NMZuka I'M SO EXCITED AVENGERS CAN MOVE OVER<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MondayMorning Important message this winter season that #baristas are doing the best they can to get your drink out in a timely fashion! You had the same idea as the 29 other people in the cafe so be patient! Cause being an ass will ensure you're getting decaf #coffeeshop<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoreenGLM @celestialtabris Thinking women are some perfect angels sent to save you smh I'VE GOT MY OWN HORNS TOO BRUH GOTTA A TAIL AND EVERYTHING ARE YOU HELPING MW BE BETTER? ARE WE LIFTING EACH OTHER UP?  We could both end up in hell behind this kind of selfish rhetoric<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so glad i was born when i was cause if i was chilling in 1976 when Marvin Gaye's "I Want You" came out and had no precedent for a song like that existing it would have drove me insane with how it sounded #saturdaynight #SaturdaySoundtrack  https://t.co/ppj51pDNRY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DC_Douglas I remember being warned by pros not to get too polotical on social media but that was advice given to me in early 2017 and I've seen most throw that out of the window<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ambitiousBard Please GOD just run to the store on your lunch break you do not have to live this way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>every once and a while a LITERAL NAZI will reach out to the company I work for and I have to figure out whether I can help them or not I wish I was joking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Correction apparently that song is called dreams dreams<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wanna do 'it feels like summer' or 'nights nights'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to start doing more actual song covers here! Gotta learn how to edit music tho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's hilarious cause people will talk about needing help for company that shall not be named and i work helping people for company that shall not be named on social media so i just show up like a phantom giving vague hints on how to get help and then vanish into the night...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so tired i feel like I'm loosing my mind... Yah girl needs a nice long vacay😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VoiceOfVegeta dm them at att cares about what happened and with your account number and they'll get back to you fairly quickly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anairis_q Yeah she's studying music and school and one of her classmates left her and dry to use theirs and she asked me and I'm like "well I can't think of any other conceivable you can get access to a decent mic in a short time frame so of course!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anairis_q working on auditions I've let build up 😅Unfortunately can't work on them till tomorrow cause I loaned my mic to a friend so they could record an assignment for school<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't wait to work on auditions tonight! In the closet it's just me and the character I'm trying to achieve no pumpkin spice colored ******* who makes me so angry that my eyeballs boil out of my head  Just me and this cute anime girl as it should be #voiceacting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>man I'd love to write a #visualnovel but I can barely draw and I have no programming experience but if anyone out there wants a nerd who spent like 7000 bucks to learn how to use certain words to evoke different emotions I'm your girl!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been pulling 11 hour shifts so I have enough money to buy myself something nice for my birthday unfortunately the amount of caffeine I've had to consume to make this possible is really taking a toll on me so a detox is in coming<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since the bathrooms are on an exterior in this place they come with a heating lamp for the winter and my bulb just so happens to be red #redlightspecial #SaturdayMorning  https://t.co/tEOG5ZGuE1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anairis_q @stravvbunnies See also: "i have no clue how to program" and "I'm terrible at art"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VoicesByBri That burgundy really suits you! #ialsochangemyhairalot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#homestuck is such a wonderfully persistently inescapable interest something will draw me back to some part of the experience and every time I find something new to appreciate about it this time it was something sad though that made re-appreciate the music<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FortWorthReid That Christmas Elizabeth figure tho! 😍Nice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DamanMills alternative third option: If you put enough rum in it I'll suck it up and deal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>even before I read the tweet I was wondering why this gif was so...sensual<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not gonna lie, I've been out of this past 2 weeks, been so tired that getting motivated is hard and creativity just ain't flowing like it used to #FridayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My weeb trash ass:.....the midnight channel<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yo happy birthday to the super cool @rachaelmesser !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JubyPhonic_P Texas democrats are some of the toughest take no crap well educated group of folks I've ever met unfortunately we are surrounded by a wave of people who don't want to know or do better trust me we're mad too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm trying to decide between doing a good impression I know I could nail or a terrible impression that could make a cool new voice in opinions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sweetxoranges Thank you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's time to focus back in on auditions and honing my acting craft! I've got auditions to practice and a competition submission to work on! So it's time to get back into it! #voiceacting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarissaLenti Ugh sorry that happened! Public transportation is such a breeding ground for creeps but I'm happy the police took care of that dude for you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The sun rises and we're still here and definitely not giving up! So let's get to work making a country we the people can actually be proud of! #WednesdayMotivation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sapphberry The only pro here is that as constituent i get to spend to next 6 years badgering him to do his job and I'm full of enough spite to do it for 5 times longer than that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@asieybarbie I might need to stay home cause I'm angry enough to chew iron about this....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This morning i #prayed for @BetoORourke to win but i also prayed for the serenity to accept what i can't change and strength to keep fighting for I can and let me tell you Mr. @tedcruz 2 out of 3 ain't bad we're going to hold you to it this next 6 years so get ready💪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listen i know we're not happy about the projection but i take it as a personal victory that #TedCruz no doubt had the nervous bowels until about 5 minutes ago<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just took this class and it was fantastic! Improve and get great back about where you are! Kyle's going to tell what you need to improve!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YONCE COMIN' THRUUUU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You should take the class! Bryan's an awesome teacher!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reasons I go by Matt: -Beloved family nickname  - I prefer it to Maddie/Maddy as the shortened version of my full name -changing 'd' to 't' is a perfectly acceptable rule in Germanic language -bending gender standards -Makes nosy conservatories big mad 🙃 #TuesdayMotivation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KaggyFilms same but like in 18 days same age high five! 🖐️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've donated I've #voted and I've #volunteered for @BetoORourke and the #democrats of texas now all that's left to do is wait and see! This is going to be nerve wracking 😵😬😱 #TuesdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MiraShiver Is it time to break out the fake library cards again? I wish facebook was this proactive about susspending certain other accounts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/1VByvHlyu1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CliffordChapin OH Nice! I've never seen anyone do it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SithingerVA the ultimate mood for nanowrimo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VoicesByBri @FUNimation @AlexisTiptonVA WOOP WOOP Congrats Brianna!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thing I have t get over is when I can't afford to take more classes is learning how to study and hone my craft on own via reading materials, I should invest in more acting books and practice some new theories and incorporate them into my performances<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryVanceVA Feel better soon harry!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NormMelding oh boy I'm going full weeb.... Ok while you are technically correct that anime just means animation the word anime has come to mean specifically eastern animation from Japan and Korea while cartoon tends to mean western animation now im gonna sop being a mega weeb and lay down<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NormMelding Norm.... you must not like your kneecaps very much to say something like that to me🙃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Coworker "So do you wanna do voice acting for just anime? Or cartoons as well?" Me "I wanna do voice acting for money,fam." #voiceover #voiceacting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>writing comes slow and not at all today... I've been creative a lot this week and it shows, I'm at a dearth right now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pluckers the holy macaroni is the best/worst thing that has ever happened to me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hear blondes have a lot of fun! And I could use some fun this #FridayMorning so I'm rocking the blonde short cut today to spice things up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OburiV3 @SmugMari @norrriey When did "If you use someone's art in your for profit project you should credit and compensate the original artist" become a controversial idea instead of like the standard?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MalikRadioRahim @liquidtomIinson @norrriey culture can be exchanged it's just a lot of times our culture gets exchanged to point of over-saturation, bastardisation and eventual rejection when memes die it becomes "cringe" to use them but these have always been our words to use?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First day of #NaNoWriMo18 ! My inner time management coach is mad at me for writing this tweet instead of writing my most recent projects<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvietheTrap @SmugMari @norrriey i mean you thought that over used comeback was funny so can you really judge?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SmugMari @norrriey Oh I'm sorry I mistook you for an actual human capable of understanding, reasoning and compassion instead of the human skin irritant your personality has formed instead of actual social skills! Won't make that mistake again!😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SmugMari @norrriey It's more like things become popular with out context or connotation Like the fornite dances which are now just funny memes while the black artists who came up with them being left in obscurity with out compensation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mom is always in my corner 😂😅  https://t.co/CPLDlxw0Hp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was the hero of time at the office today this #Halloween didn't win the costume contest but won a lot of 💕 #LegendOfZelda #Link  https://t.co/8KddS1zg3g<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Being a perfectionist is often a counter to being positive part of me is upset that not where I want to be right at this very moment while another part of me has to hold out the knowledge that I will get there in time with some more practice and experience! #WednesdayMotivation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anairis_q none of us are! But here we go again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Safe to say my werewolf short story won't be finished today.... but it will be done in time for #NaNoWriMo so that's a plus! We'll just have to pretend it's still the spooky times when you all read it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VoiceOfVegeta @FUNimation @ToeiAnimation I notice something new in this picture each time I see it and it's driving me mad this is absolutely wild 🤣😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KylePhillipsFUN @StarMan_Studios @VoicesByBri @RNGVoice @kimleesi @johnwesleygovo @JenAlyx @MarianneDHobbit It was a lot of fun! And I learned a lot about taking direction and maintaining energy! Thanks so much!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#HappyHalloween Currently dressed up as my favorite hero Link to try and win this costume contest at work! Wish me luck!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TuesdayMorning Sent 'em forgot 'em and now I'm moving on with my week! #audition<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kumailn SO UH WHAT ARE Y'ALL GONNA DO ABOUT THAT?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My lack of twitter activity is because the news is just a lot to deal with right now, also my eyes are currently burning orbs of pain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Things are scary right now with all the bad news rolling in so today's #SaturdayMotivation is just to be kind! Smile and say hello to strangers, send a nice text to a friend you haven't chatted with in a while take time to treat yourself as well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woo! Home for the night! Time to bake some cookies and watch @Castlevania<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GodswillUgwaJr Same! Where are the adult friendly houses for trick or treating?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@willsdarklady yeah, my place was packed too when I went and that was late in the day they even ran out of stickers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd love to stay out of politics but like key parts of my identity have been politicized so you know how that goes! 🙃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jacobwilson549 Well my polling place wasn't even using the same software so I should be fine.... I definitely would have noticed Ted's name instead of Beto's<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jacobwilson549 I always review my ballot to make sure everything is checked but now I'm a bit worried.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My main method of coping with anger is just being a sweet person cause I'm not sure if I can fight  https://t.co/WW3kw1KlWT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benbevoicing Naughty VAs get sent to the T O O T H  R O O M to be cleansed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@norrriey It's strange when phrases we've been saying for years becomes the new trending meme and then die off from the popular view cause when I continue to use it people think I'm trying to bring back an old fad when it's always been in my vocabulary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's #FridayFeeling and #FridayMotivation is simply... I love my friends!🥰Through thick and thin, good and bad or better and worse they've been there for me supportive and open comforting and caring! So here's a shout out to new and old friends here on twitter and elsewhere!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpadeKc @Whataburger You can't fight it when comes you just give in and get your fave!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OH CHRIST ON A CRACKER ARE YOU KIDDING ME????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GhostAlebrije Nice! What's their name?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you live in texas and you haven't eaten @Whataburger in a while, you will suddenly be hit with a very powerful and nigh undeniable urge for it. That time has come for me...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually getting writing done? What is this wondrous feeling of my fingers hitting the keyboard and adding cohesive sentence to a narrative? I never want it to end! #ThursdayMotivation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MisterMassey One time he boarded his cool presidential plane with toilet paper stuck to his shoe which was really funny until the exact moment it wasn't<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't wait till I can buy this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NMZuka (good luck! I believe in you!)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A friend at work loaned me a stim toy! And it's great unfortunately it's a stretchy banana toy and people in the office keep making inappropriate jokes at my expense #ThursdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The package is expected to arrive today! thanks so much to the #dragonballtour at #dallasfandays for making this possible and the always awesome Mr.@VoiceOfVegeta for his autograph! Now standing by for delivery and excited messages<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Something happens in the fall/winter that causes me to get migraines Probably time to visit my doctor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone know where you can get an "I voted" sticker when you already went to vote and the polling place ran out? Asking for a friend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccarrollbeard doing your civic duty looks great on you! (I'm still sad they ran out of stickers at my polling location😭)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WednesdayMotivation last night I reached a goal in my acting and voice acting! I tended to under act in auditions and had to be directed to put in more energy but I'm finally reaching that point where I needed to be reigned back in instead of built up! And I'll keep improving!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anairis_q MOOD but let's get this bread i guess🙃😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>running on 5 hours of sleep because I am an adult who makes questionable choices<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaseyTheVA The amount of people who actually actively have to be told this is always staggering to me Like VA is a big community but not so big that people won't hear you talking smack<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahWiedenheft the fruit on the sprite can is real!?!👀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bold of you to assume they even had one....  https://t.co/owT3hgSXNi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dgoins @wfaa @JasonWhitely My polling place was packed! Seeing a good strong turn out this year<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NMZuka (Oooh proud of you for getting the opportunity!)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DawnMBennettVA I'm also black and bisexual and their experience is not a universal one from fear of discrimination at work to having costly medical bills for genetic dispositions called preexisting conditions the right has done me no favors and so now i vote my interests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I gotta day of adulting to do Laundry  Sweeping and moping Running to the post office  And washing the dog But the most important adult thing i gotta do today is #VOTE and #VoteBlue at that! See ya at the polls!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>MY FAVORITE PART OF THE DAY!  https://t.co/ui3n3jCXqr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fiona_Sorel The only thing more insulting would have been going to McDs... But they were a little too far<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really loving living here...  https://t.co/gltF3tCtfJ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Like a #SundayMorning  https://t.co/0px3VspmzF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MiraShiver I've found that drinking too glasses of wine in the tub and passing out in bed is a pretty close substitute though🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MiraShiver i wish I could auto end days like a jrpg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's something special in the air this Saturday in #DFW! And whatever it is it's irritating my eyes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MisterMassey I become a Grinch too every holiday I have to work retail🙃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@splendidland Yeah and the way it deals with sexuality, and relationships has it's high points and then some really deep low points (Rei's whole character arc)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@splendidland I think it's a show people who like mecha as genre should experience but it's not accurate to say that i like it and a ton of people feel that way about it like you could watch any version of devilman and get the similar themes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today is going to be a "writing and recover my mental health day" so tweets may be slow! A bit too burned to out to make my usual twitter based jokes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Tomorrow I work with a manager at the coffee shop who stresses me out due to how high energy he is and his personality is grating<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>so writing a cute Halloween short story about a girl dating a werewolf it's a metaphor for fear of emotional intimacy and also there's not enough cute werewolf short stories<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Iron_Spike "You can't make an American adaption cause it's about feeling like western capitalism culture has consumed a more traditional culture!!!" I've got some exciting news about what POC in this country have experienced over the past 200 years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iron_Spike Adding: A western AKIRA movie could still have the same themes of the original comic if you had a mixed POC cast and focused on how colonialism/capitalism has effected them culturally<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NMZuka (sorry bro maybe tomorrow)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yuriofwind good to see you back hope you're doing well!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So that's just one facet of my illness that I wanted to talk about that doesn't gt talked about often! #WorldMentalHealthDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've learned to use this tactic in all forms of rejections as well! Friend can't hang out? It's alright I know they still love me Piece of writing not getting a lot of attention? I've still improved from writing it! #WorldMentalHealthDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Times like that I've learned to fall back on my education, experience and the positive feedback I've received then I can take a step back and actually process my emotions in a more rational way! #WorldMentalHealthDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like I said there are still hard days, sometimes I don't get a part I was excited for or I get feed back on audition that just really hurts to hear it causes a cascade of self doubt I wonder if I'm actually good enough to be an actor #WorldMentalHealthDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Then I learned about rejection dysphoria and everything made sense! I wasn't just some cry baby my mind was wired to blow rejections out of proportion and just knowing that made me a little more confident about getting into #voiceacting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My whole life I've taken critique and rejection to heart and I never knew why people would just brush it off and tell me toughen up harden my heart and not take it personally #WorldMentalHealthDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I remember when @AtYes2Ats was talking about how rejection is a huge part of acting and that you have to learn to roll with it and My stomach kind dropping cause I knew I take rejection hard #WorldMentalHealthDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want you to know the irony of having rejection sensitive dysphoria and being a #voiceactor a job where you get rejected often is never lost on me There are days that are hard I'm not going to lie to you #WorldMentalHealthDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No one talks about these very serious symptoms of ADHD and yet everyone is quick to cal it a fake disease not to mention how under diagnosed it is in girls we need to be bringing these other symptoms to the forefront #WorldMentalHealthDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Words like rejection dysphoria or over emotional sensitivity manic and depressive episodes low impulse control even increased risks for addictions had never been brought up and yet I had experienced all of them #WorldMentalHealthDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't learn about the emotional effects of ADHD until I was in my 20s I had been diagnosed for close to 15 years and a whole half of my illness was completely untreated #WorldMentalHealthDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>See in my experience it was treated more like a learning disorder not a mental illness so focus was devoted to making sure I could succeed in school and not the other effects it had on my life while I understand my mom's intentions this left me at a disadvantage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ADHD has to be one of the most misleading mental illnesses and one of the most frustrating to deal with so let's talk about it on this #WorldMentalHealthDay<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>As i recover from accidentally poisoning myself I'm going to send a shout out to the awesome acting teachers on this #WorldTeachersDay @rachaelmesser and sunny blue studios was one of the first voice acting classes i took! I learned a lot about rhythm and cadences!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@willsdarklady Oh yeah I get that. It'd be inconsiderate when they are just trying to have down time and regular conversations like normal people I literally didn't talk to Wehkamp for all of afest even though I wanted to catch up cause he seemed busy and kept getting stopped<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willsdarklady Understandable. Respectfully say you enjoy their work and then go fangirl in the hotel room (it's what i do) 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willsdarklady TELL THEM WE LOVE THEM<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>also Sagittarius feeling very called out right now...🙃😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NMZuka (Take 'em where you can get them ZUk's!)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listen I'm tired of being harassed and I am tired of being afraid so I'm skipping right past fear and sliding straight into unadulterated rage with this. You aren't gonna intimidate me you aren't going to control me I OWE YOU NOTHING #EnoughIsEnough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I put my headphones back in and say "You aren't gonna trap me in social conventions to make me talk to you" he pulls out a bible and we sit like this till I get off at my stop and then he tries to send a 'creepy text' but I block him #EnoughIsEnough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He tries to chat me up when I obviously am not interested. He asks for my name I tell him Matt cause of course he's not getting my full name. He asks why I'm being so mean and says "God protects you so you don't have to worry about what people do" #EnoughIsEnough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I ride the same bus to work everyday, see a lot of the same people on there every morning but I have NEVER seen this guy on here so BS sensors are now going up as well I go into full #bitchmode lock down as soon as he sits down #EnoughIsEnough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The number never picks up and goes to voicemail and by this time my bus shows up and I'm starting to get the Creepy Dude Vibes (TM) so I'm like "This is my bus I need to go" and this f*ckin guy FOLLOWS ME ONTO MY BUS AND SITS NEXT TO ME<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So let me give a little more details here. I was waiting for my connecting bus at Addison minding my own business when this older guy comes up to me and asks if I can dial a number for him and being nice i did #EnoughIsEnough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GOOD MORNING TWITTER! this is the phone number of the guy who wouldn't stop harassing me on the bus! His name is Kenny and if you'd like to call and lecture him on manners feel free to do so! Be sure to retweet this! It takes a village  https://t.co/oTlr9lGJYl<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheMorganBerry @ConradNarrates Smarter people than me have explained this concept but being torn down and told you're not good enough can become comforting because it validates anxieties involved with putting yourself out there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMorganBerry @ConradNarrates There's welcome critique and then there's the horrific toxic dump zone that is an internet comment section What's worse you can actually become addicted to negative feed back over enough time<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So I've told her and myself that I'm going to get my first con booking for #voiceacting at one near her and we're going to hang out and have fun. I'm speaking that into existence as much as possible! She's been so supportive she deserves this! #TuesdayMotivation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TuesdayMotivation A friend whom I love dearly is in a bad home situation that's not great for her mental health and I'd love nothing more than to rip her out of it! But all I can do for now is send her cool anime merch and memes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>LIKE THE TEXT TONE I HAD FOR PAV DURRING HIGH AND COLLEGE WHEN WE WERE BOTH FILTHY HOMESTUCKS KEEPS GOING OFF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know what kinda sucks? The fact that we've added such stigma to being attention seeking. Like yeah obvi if you're doing things for attention and actively hurting others that's bad but when you're a creative or neruatypical or just very social you want to be noticed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've reached that point where I've had more caffeine than actual food and it doesn't feel good in my head space.... my thoughts are starting to race I need to focus on some writing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gonna run to spirit and get a UA jumpsuit and call it a day<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Someone in the office is using the same text notification tone that I used for @cmyk426 for the majority of our friendship and it's giving me the most chaotic Pavlovian vibes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not even gonna lie... Had to pry myself out of bed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fiona_Sorel @NICKIMINAJ I have a voice that I need to test for an audition so I might post the results sometime this weekend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're wondering why i post a lot...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jacobwilson549 I guess for all the foot traffic but now that you mention it yes the giant cowboy robot effigy is a strange place to advertise that<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I think i might make the world's most pointless podcast but who cares! It's practice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anairis_q @SoundCadence @AmberLeeConnors Awesome! Have fun!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was raised by choir directors so singing/rapping is how I check my breath control and get my cords prepared to record but I keep varying it to figure out what warm up style I like best #voiceacting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rhythm of the night and 24k magic are my typical finishers for regular warm ups and if I'm doing a voice that needs to sound more aggressive/tough I rap Let me ride by dr.dre to see how the tone sounds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I need to test if a voice is sustainable and check the inflections I can put it through while still maintaining it I rap @NICKIMINAJ verse in monster and that has resulted in some hilarious moments that i should post at some point #voiceacting #VOwarmups<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jacobwilson549 well both classes offering things I'm excited about kyle more booth and audition critique andy and Chuck actually learning thw business ends the real clincher is the fact that my laptop is not long for this world and I'd hate for it to break mid session<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a beautiful golden moon out on this autumn night in Texas 🌙 makes up for the late bus ride<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jacobwilson549 A toss up between an online class with @AndyVoiceover /@Chuck_Huber class online and @KylePhillipsFUN class at starman!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😜maybe...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it's time to take more risks! I'm going to do a class this fall and hope for the best!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Castlevania @TimeOutNewYork HOW FAR DID THEY GET IN EPISODE 1 BEFORE DEEMING THIS A KIDS SHOW? A WOMAN GETS BURNED ALIVE 5 MINUTES IN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a toss up between an online class and a in studio class my biggest thing about the online class is my laptop is not long for this world and I don't want it to die midway the in person class starts right when I get off of work I'd have to ask to leave early<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really wanna take another voice acting class for the fall but I'm afraid of some unexpected expenses popping up randomly (it's been that kinda year) as soon as I put myself in for one (plus my work schedule is pretty demanding atm)😩<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DawnMBennettVA A karaoke session in a hot shower! Breathing in the steam and opening up the chords at the same time! Also hot coconut milk and honey helps as well!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ArloStuff Adults mad at children is what that boiled down to<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That girl is my hero<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so glad they're making a new #AnimalCrossing so now that team can stop sticking genicidal crazed AIs in children's games #Splatoon2 (y'all just were gonna let commnder tatar slide huh)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Currently packing for tomorrow. But after that i plan on trying to knock some auditions since I'll be gone! I regret that heavy lunch though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesMolloyVA Oh that sounds fun! Of course I can't think of a song at the moment<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"Wow I got that down in a few takes" "This was a voice I didn't know I could do!" "I found a better place to sit that voice that makes it stronger and more sustainable"  Stuff like that it's fantastic instead of wondering whether I was good enough for a part #voiceactor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something I think I'm slowly getting better about with #auditions is learning to appreciate them for how much better I've gotten. It helps me not focus whether or not I got the part now it's "wow I can't believe this is what I sound like now. Nice" #voiceacting #voiceovertalent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mario is reacting the correct amount to this situation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You had to volunteer, you had to block walk, you had to phone bank, and then voting was the last thing of course but you had to be involved and working campaigns that was the standard and you can probably draw conclusions about why #ThursdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not to be too political as I do like having an income, but growing up black in the deep south there was a different standard of what you had to to leading up to voting, voting was the icing on the cake #ThursdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also fun reminder! If you can't donate money to a campaign you can always donate your time! Volunteer if you can! Be active in your Democratic process!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WHAT THEY ARE IN THE BAD PLACE WHAT THE HELL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Waterfalls" is one of the most iconic songs of the 90s but every time I hear it it sounds like it could have been produced like recently Like it doesn't even sound like anything else on the CrazySexyCool album??? #ThursdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ambitiousBard He's also a literal war lord which is just kinda cool in general<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TaylorLeLa4 Thank you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeganTaylorVA You're welcome! It took me a while to realize when it comes to creation you can't keep putting stuff out without taking things in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeganTaylorVA For me writers block typically means I haven't been consuming enough media to help the creation process. Try watching a few episodes of a show you've been meaning to get around to or reading a comic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey.... what do you do when you're a writer with a lot of comic ideas but like no drawing skills? How do you find an artist to help you bring ideas to life and how do you get the money to help support said artist bring ideas to life?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm doing a lot better today guys! Thanks to everyone who reached out yesterday. I'll be leaving for Mississippi Friday for the funeral so that's going to be a roller coaster considering bringing my laptop<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's really hard cause I'm also fighting feelings of hopelessness about a lot of stuff I just wanna lay down in a corner and eat myself into a food coma I'm just kinda of in a sad place right now so I wouldn't mind support from friends right now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I haven't been talking about this but recently a close family member passed away and I am trying real hard not to give into destructive behaviors right now I am fighting the urge to order a pizza and waste money #TuesdayThoughts<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In the middle of a writers block my brain came up with a whole different story idea and that's just the #ADHD culture<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Castlevania No disrespect but I think you're being a little generous with that sobriety stat 😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh, why do I feel so tired? I thought I got plenty of rest this weekend apparently not. I can't wait till I don't have to pull overtime and can work on more personal projects like a proper sleep schedule<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's strange how simple #fandom concepts like "don't make explicit content of minors and siblings" and "be aware of the toxic relationships you're romanticizing to an audience" has turned into "NO FUN ALLOWED" #antis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOOF! I forgot how much planning even low effort #cosplay takes (and cash) but It's fun to be at it again! I knew I wanted to cosplay this character the first time I saw them a few years back and now I have the funds and an excuse to!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@benbevoicing Yiiikes dude sorry to hear that happened! Will definitely keep my ears to the ground for this guy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nilaffle And i think this comes from the fact that everyone learns to write to communicate for the most basic technical purposes not realizing that's just the foundation of the art of writing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nilaffle I've never heard that writing is more valuable but what i do hear is writing is highly under valued as a skill especially within fandom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NMZuka (If i saw that in person i think all my bones would break at the same time)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Childish Gambino" feels like summer got me with a lot feelings but I want to break down one specific thing and that is the black space we see in the music video and touch on a few people who are there and why they are their (a thread)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you remember...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've gotta remember to order a custom shirt from one of the many print shops in the area for a cosplay I'm working on. The thing is the shirt has yet to be shown in color in cannon so I keep going back and forth on it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBlackNerd wishing the best boy a happy bday!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dogboylover w-why did you photoshop it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaptismOnFire As good as lovecrafts horror was it was directly inspired by his racism in some cases (the fish people abominations being his fear of race mixing) so I'm gonna give it to Poe cause his autobio dude was like his worst enemy hence that smear campaign<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CorinaBoettger Fam Dallas is a very friendly town that loves to talk I've "met" other VAs before even being in the same physical location as them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listen I know it's vain, but i will gladly sacrifice my toes in these wedges for the 3 extra inches of height this low to the ground life ain't easy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is literally how I flirt and no matter how cute people constantly say I am when I start talking it's a revelation to all potential suitors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Wedsnesdaythoughts Hey why does the uncanny valley fear response even exist??? Why did we evolve to have this fear???? At what point in human history did we have to be on the look out for potential human looking threats that didn't quite get the details right???<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TJRDBKK @superfighterman @oracleofdewphi @jayne_pea The problem with this mind set is that problems like police brutality stem from not respecting someone's personhood if you can't do something as basic as acknowledge preferred pronouns how can i trust you to help with systematic discrimination<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tisheriffic I needed to hear this I left college after realizing that I was able to handle the mental and emotional strain of it and my relatives have been giving back handed compliments about how I'm too smart not to be in school and being pressured back into it before I'm ready<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HammyCrash @ericvale Well i can understand that but also understand that women constantly and historically  have their experiences invalidated you were playing skeptic to a group of people who always face skepticism and it came off crass and dismissive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HammyCrash @ericvale I was a cisgendered woman have never experienced a swift kick to the family jewels but if you tell me it hurts like the dickens for it I'll take your word for it. The fact is you aren't willing to take women's word for it that these things happen<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@willsdarklady @Rickyiism @ChrisWehkamp no worries I understand! I was going to suggest a semi-class reunion over tacos!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anairis_q So I went "be the change you want to see" and started my journey (that and the need to make sure anime stays accessible to fans who for whatever reason can't watch subs)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anairis_q I'm a black voice actress in Texas myself and I try not to bring up the topic too much cause I don't want to be labeled as a complainer or playing the race card, but my race is part of the reason i got into VO I wasn't seeing enough people like me in the industry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I know @Rickyiism and @ChrisWehkamp are gonna be at afest this weekend are you going @willsdarklady ?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@drowzydruzy this might be happening due to people trying to more the term 'lesbian' in the same nebulous meaning that 'gay' has become (it's commonly used in respect to mlm but is also used for women and bi people as well) Lesbian does deserve the right to stand on it's own tho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drowzydruzy Maybe I'm out of the loop on what's been happening lately but most of the time when I hear Bi woman calling themselves lesbians it's to protect themselves from being judged as not "gay" enough and have some rando drill you about your preference/past relationships<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The bond between a person and their first doctor in #DoctorWho is unbreakable. I will watch anything with David Tenant and lucky for me he always does things I'm interested in!

<|startoftext|>@DamanMills @caitlinsvoice getting hit with a gust of wind now is like having a huge high powered hair dryer blowing in your face<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MiraShiver How about the head of the troll that's been destroying the crops?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that's enough mental illness tweeting for one day! Talk later<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So essentially i don't take rejection well, but i do process it well! If this sounds familiar to you, you should read up more on RSD and ways to mange it!  Once i knew what the problem was it was easy to fix. Now if your Dysphoria is very intense consider thearpy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Then once my emotions are back in proper order i can actually properly refrect and process the rejection and any criticism that came along with it! Then I'm ready to improve! Wash rince repeat! Each time i face rejection the Dysphoria lasts less time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What i do is accept the rejection and in the moment act like I've taken it well, then when i get to a more private setting a let the Dysphoria run it's course but make careful steps not to act on it (a very important step!)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now very often i hear a sentence like this "if you can't take rejection then acting isn't going to be a good fit for you" and that was tough to hear as someone who is predisposed to not being able to take rejection but loved acting but mama didn't raise a quitter!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now i suffer from a little something called Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria or RSD for short. It's actually a very common symptom of ADHD (and different mood disorders) RSD makes me perceive rejection as a lot worse than it actually is it really sucks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So there's something i do wanna talk about as a #voiceactor and that is taking rejection... And how i am not good at it!  Now before we get any deeper let me be clear i absolutely DO NOT take this out on anyone when i don't get cast you shouldn't either<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@yoshika_miyako And you wanna know how queer and dyke aren't the same? Cause you can say queer on daytime television cause "queer studies" is a field that exist and "dyke studies" isn't<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yoshika_miyako @celestialtabris You really have to sit down and ask "Who benefits from this word being policed like this? And who doesn't" Why would we suddenly need or want to police a word that had become common vernacular in not just the community but in the world at large<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yoshika_miyako @celestialtabris I get that the people were really taken by the arguments that queer is a slur and they aren't wrong queer was a slur in the past and is a slur in some places now but to ignore the rate which it has been reclaimed is disrespectful to the movement<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I got into a bad habit about auditions where if the conditions weren't just so (recording space not quiet enough, not able to get a fifteen minute warm up done, character not in me range) i would procrastinate or put off doing it Now I've learned sometimes you just go for it<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChrisWehkamp I was actually talking about this reccently with some other voice actors and a person mentioned how they heard the dallas market was cliquey. It's not about cliques though it's making sure you can do good work and aren't a total jerk to work with<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChrisWehkamp It's been fun guys but I'm out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nyxfears Alright I'll leave you to go on that fun adventure unspoiled! But seriously thanks again for opening up this discussion you've been one of my favorite creators for like 2 years now and it awesome to hear you talk about these films<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nyxfears Thank you for covering Tyler Perry movies in a serious way! So many people dismiss them without realizing what's actually wrong and while being very disrespectful. I love that you like watching them cause i too still like watching them and oh gosh have you ever seen the plays?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Based on harmful century old ideas but still a commentary. You're awesome i love your content and if you're ever down in dallas look me up! Your coffees on me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And that's without even going into how Madea is both a Sapphire and a Jezebelle rolled into one handy sterotype. But i gotta clock in now. This has been a fun discussion and i loved how you treated the movies as legit films that have a commentary to make<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a double edged hell sword that has no winner. Being too femine makes you a weak black woman being to powerful and strong means you can't find love and Tyler is selling you can hit that sweet spot of the sterotype and make it work<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perry instrad of totally ripping this sterotype apart tries to demonize some of it while glorifying part of it. "You can't be so hard and tough that you can't let love in" and "Being too weak makes you too vulnerable as black women toughen up"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tyler is also playing into a fantasy. Remember how i said Sapphire is a sterotype that's become accepted as truth? Yeah this is true of black women themselves. A lot black women believe they have to be strong independent and tough in order to truly be a black woman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He wants his cake and to eat it too and this ends up with a lot of confusing messages to an outside observer of black culture but to an insider looking in you understand the fundamental misstep tyler Perry's media<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He tries to show "hey look you can be a black woman who's soft enough to be loved despite still being strong and powerful. A good man excepts the fact you're playing into a centuries old sterotype of your womanhood (or lack there of)"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tyler Perry in his movies wants to undo those tropes while also romanticizing them and he has yet to realize that it's both impossible and harmful to do both well he really is the king of learning the wrong lesson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"The strong independent black woman who don't need no man" yeah that's the Sapphire sterotype all dressed up in church clothes and unfortunately the short sightness of white feminism had pushed the trope as being subverous when it's really not but whole other ball of wax<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Then there's the Sapphire and this one is much more incidious because of how normalized it. The Sapphire is the sterotype of black women not being femine. In fact it pushes that black women are very masculine and emasculate black men at every turn because they run the household<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These are the Sapphire and the Jezebelle. Ones pretty obvious Jezebelle is the idea of black women being sexual devious and dominate. Wanting it all the time and anywhere this sterotype is why people are critical of the care free black girl trope<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay I'm gonna keep this focused but there are two very important stereotypes about black women that like a lot of black sterotypes somehow got adopted as truth and now have become a staple of black female characters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MiraShiver Hold on to your specific tastes Mira! Don't end up like me *injects an espresso iv drip right into my jugular*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you wouldn't mind @Nyxfears I'd actually like to discuss a little more things about Tyler Perry and his movies cause holy shit does it get even more crazy (and kinda tragic) when you're black and from the South and have media literacy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>explaining the crazed perversion that is the tyler perry's view on southern black culture is hard for me as a a black person from the south but @Nyxfears does a damn good job<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the mood constantly in my head  https://t.co/AIKn3XTIIv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hostess_Snacks why can't i find these sweet bites of heaven anywhere in the DFW area? I only ever get them durring road trips out of town. I stocked up though!  https://t.co/MlrjbL5j2S<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MiraShiver What internet callout culture is supposed to be "Watch out! This person can and will cause harm in some way. Be warned!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want people to know that the way i get back at those folks who aggressively say merry Christmas when i say happy holidays as courtesy is to great every person who walks through the door of the store with a "happy black history month"  Happy Black History Month! 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So fun thing this morning. The barista calls me for my drink using Matt as my name and a woman stares disapprovingly as i respond to a "boys name"   She didn't have to say anything i know that look.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisWehkamp Yay! Glad to see you back chris<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NM_NickNocturne Congrats Nick I always had a feeling! Welcome to the bi club all the best to you and your boyfriend ❤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Caddicarus Not only that but the advertising pre this movie being shown totally failed to market this properly  I went in expecting a very light hearted family film not a deeply emotional animatied film that would replace finding nemo as my favorite<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I brief hint I've been watching @NM_NickNocturne how to make a web series videos and have been applying different ideas from each approach something creepy is coming...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have been working on a personal audio project that due to the nature of the project i can not talk about in detail which is painful as an artist<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@iantweeting I'm glad this is back on tv! This is the show that made me fall back in love with anime<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DawnMBennettVA mood of 2018<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well anyways since this was made for Christmas/new years DLC I'd like to wish everyone a Happy New Year! and I dedicate this thread to @cmyk426<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>this song could have won best R&amp;B single at the grammys 20 years ago, this is like the best version of Dreams Dreams ever if you played this for a regular person they'd never think this came from a video game about a blue hedgehog<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listen to this magic  https://t.co/vp6X03RF7F<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The game in question is famous or infamous depending upon who you ask eventually got ports to other consoles under a director's cut edition in which the director thought it was a good idea to cut out this beautiful rendition from the soundtest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But I did say this was 90s R&amp;B song what dlc was kinda of new concept in the 90s in fairness this game was released late in the 90s and pc developers were starting to make use of it... except this game was a console release<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This very beautifully arranged song is from a Christmas dlc of a game and the song itself is actually the main theme of a different game that was developed by the same design team that other game has close ties to Christmas...still with me?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want you to know that i've been listening to this beautiful 90s R&amp;B acapella song that existence vexes me to no end let me explain...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaptismOnFire I'm shocked but also not surprised<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been listening to the sonic adventure soundtrack since 2017 ended and 2018 began.... 2018 is gonna be great!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YOU MONSTER  https://t.co/CkUT7ZDQit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I still can not BELIEVE in an E rated game that there is legit a storyline about a robot killing his fellow robots in order to set them free from their creator<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ringing in the new year by playing sonic adventure!  Might also make some cupcakes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay sappy reflective stuff done! Now i can get to the fun part! Those booze!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know if I'll get where i want to be this year but i know I'll be even closer and i know I'm not giving up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So here's my wish for 2018. To get further than i am now. To try new ways to push myself as a creative to not fear failures I'm going to have and to have as many supportive and positive folks around and to give positivity and support right back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And there have been other regards where it hasn't been so awesome where things have felt impossible where i felt dispair, where i felt alone. Where i was disappointed in myself for not being futher along But for better or worse i got through them and will keep on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I found a community of other actors working towards their goals and let me tell you 2017 has been a great year for new friendships and new opportunities and new experience that i never thought I'd try. It's been an awesome year in that regard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About this time last year i had next to no cofidence in my abilities as an actress. Imposters syndrome had me convinced i was just some kid chasing a fairy tale. Fast forward to now and I know i have something to bring to the table<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While i pop another expectorant let me just say, 2017 has been me chasing my dreams in spectacular fashion and even though I feel like I'm not where i need to be or want to be I've got to admit I've come very far from this time last year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@this chest cold I've had for a week. Either kill me or leave what we doing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kimkiminycreate @JohnWolfeYT I've doing fine! And you're doing great streaming. @JRJigglyPuff i see you working hard too my dude!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When our kids had to stare at Confederate flags/monuments and told they were heroes where was our respect?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And during the years of mistreatment and inequality and police shootings where was out respect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When our leaders were murdered and we were beaten and burned for wanting equality where was our respect?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When we came to the "radical" idea to fight for the right to be equal citizens of this country where was our respect?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When we fought and died in war after war only to come back to a country that treated us less than citizens where was our respect?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When we were being whipped and beaten as slaves when did the respect come for us? When we were being lynched and burned where was is?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay real talk and then maybe I'll stop tweeting political  Y'all talking about respect for the flag? But when does the respect come for us?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@willsdarklady @Fusion Yeah another problem is black girls who are lucky enough to go into preforming arts are expected to take very serious roles/work<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fusion It just feels like all things being equal there'd be a lot more black lady vas what do you think  @willsdarklady<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fusion That's not to say any of these mean they aren't looking. I've found the VA community to be very supportive of my progress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fusion And that's not even speaking of anime (the section I'm trying to get into) I can't think of anyone (tho I just might not be versed enough)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fusion When it comes right down to it besides cree Summers and @kimberlydbrooks  there are not a lot of black voice actresses in animation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fusion Getting into acting and voice acting is hard I am aware of this but I have an extra hurdle to add and that's being an African American<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Your parents probably told you thunder was "god bowling" right? that's not how it works in the deep south part of the bible belt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So they only thing worse than a big storm was being in the dark during a big storm and then the sirens would go off and just terrify me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My beloved home state is a very forested area that often ran power-lines through the woods cause IDK so a power outage was guaranteed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How about some fun storm stories to pass the time Like any kid growing up hated storms they terrified me and it was made worse by blackouts<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>like what exactly was dreamworks was thinking with casting a white actress in ghost in the shell?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cerberusbitch white people are too much for me sometimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TyreeBP gotta add working while black to the list if new crimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me:*driving by lemonade stand* Do you guys have it on vynyl or just CD? #beyoncelemonade #beyonce<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>well the #Splatoon final boss fuckin has next to no predictability well it does but it bombards you with so much crap it feels like it don't<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>you ever think to yourself "wow this boss could have kicked my ass if it had more unpredictable attack patterns" #videogames #Splatoon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>pray for ya homme slick as the weather here is terrible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>well it's not going to be a quiet evening   https://t.co/cD0sQcYApV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>yeah there's no mistaking where i am...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cerberusbitch let's see where it puts me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>me answering the phone: Hi this is starbucks them: *snickering* can you make a frappachino that tastes like rainbows? me: bruh I have a line<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I FUCKIN CHOCKED LAUGHING AT THIS  https://t.co/NprScYZHdM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>... - you ever think that thing adachi does with his eye is less him being creepy and more the fact that...  https://t.co/M5tsAtTOCY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As finals approach closer I too approach closer to death...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cerberusbitch I have so much faith and love for these kids then I remember they barely caught the bad guy like Jesus kids get it together<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cerberusbitch do you ever think about how close the kids were to not catching adachi?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>like real talk the climax of p4 used to be exciting but now that i've had a chance to understand adachi as a character it's horrifying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PLUS ADACHI IS CANONCALLY A GREAT MARKSMEN HE COULD HAVE JUST AIMED FOR THEIR HEADS?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THESE KIDS ARE WEARING ARMOR FOR LIKE SHADOWS AND SHIT WAS ANY OF THAT ACTUALLY BULLET PROOF?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>by the way how the fuck did adachi managed to get his ass handed to him by 8 kids when he had a LOADED FUCKING GUN?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>comm majors me: You know that people aren't constantly available to communicate all the time   Anxiety me: they hate yo ass lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>like there was the idea slave's spirits hung around just to ruin white people's day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>like it may be because i'm from the deep south and that place is crazy lousy with superstitions but i feel deep in my heart spirits are real<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i don't know what's with people's new found fascination with fuckin with spirits<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>like you can't reclaim a slur that isn't yours to reclaim girl<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Me: im gonna design a character with natural hair Also me: how in gods great fuck do you draw dreadlocks?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the fuck isa side profile<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>so racism and wanting to draw porn of a murderous douchebag is why i draw now a days<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the other thing that fuels my art is wanting to be able to draw #adachi in compromising positions but that's slightly less inspirational...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I LET MY BITTERNESS OF LACK OF REPRESENTATION FUEL ALL MY ART, DRAWING, WRITING, AND OTHERWISE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>drawing is frustrating and I'm so terrible at digital art BUT IF I DON'T DRAW POC CHARACTERS WITH GREAT STORIES WHO WILL?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cerberusbitch yeah there totally is and she has crossed a line that she can't cross back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cerberusbitch there's no excuse for it anymore she's just soooo damn problematic and kinda not a good person<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cerberusbitch like yeah no that's so shitty she's gotten too out of hand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cerberusbitch like prejudice in the black community is so rampant and we never wanna talk about it and Banks is the result of that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cerberusbitch which anti blackness is a thing she just takes it to the next level and it's exhausting like girl u always angry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cerberusbitch that's what she shows all the tine. This constant I'm black therefore other races hate me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cerberusbitch like as far as the stuff she says about other groups I will admit the black community can have an us vs. Them mindset<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cerberusbitch she's just such a disappoinment to the rap and black community I gave her sooo many chances to not be a shitty person<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoknRollPumpkin they broke it so many times<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>at this point your probably eating only slightly better than adachi in prison   https://t.co/KSv56mq7UK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And at the bottom of that picture is me and Pav almost dying in the ice rink surrounded by homestucks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But before he left he took a picture from the top most floor of the mall of all the cosplayers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to remind you the General Ivan said no cosplayers or he'd leave the meet up which I think he made good on that promise<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Then we hop out on the ice to skate something neither of could really do surrounded by cosplayers #homestuck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We both admit how we were this close to wearing our #homestuck shirts that day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So we go to the ice rink at the bottom floor of the mall there are homestucks everywhere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pav had stopped reading about a year ago and I only had just stopped that summer but we were still kinda active in the fandom #homestuck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We both knew this would make that day's hang out more interesting to say the least So we exit macy's and there are even more cosplayers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So then it hits me that this #homestuck meet up is happening here and by the time pav gets there I relay this info to him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was before I was a cosplayer so this was my first time seeing cosplayers in person best part they were cosplaying hetalia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This did not occur to me of course So I'm waiting for @Haonstooth at macy's (a time held tradition of ours) when I see cosplayers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As you must of guessed the mall the meet up was happening at and the cool mall we were going to were one and the same<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He also lives in dallas and the meet up was to happen at a mall (Dallas has a shit ton of huge malls) but he requested no one cosplay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The night before on tumblr I saw this one super popular homestuck dude was having a meet and greet the next day (general ivan)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I was dude I wanna go to the Galleria and ice skate so we set a time and date to hang out there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So i had never been to this one very fancy mall in our city (we live in dallas) and it was near time to go back to school for my senior year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But let me tell you my favorite #homestuck story It happened in the summer of 2012 and of course @Haonstooth was there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>so here's my #homestuck413 fantroll from the distant year 2010 drawn by @Haonstooth  he is still a great artist  https://t.co/6ZeOHyFz8B<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was a free day in highschool dance class when I started reading #problemslueth #homestuck #413<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I still remember the day @Haonstooth  got me into #mspaintadventures<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In hindsight I should have taken this day off. It's a holiday for me.  #homestuck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I met so many cool people through that webcomic and it is one of the many fandoms that improved my writing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But today is #413  why am I twetting about anything but the end of #homestuck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Then I remember that #jjba  has been going for over 20 years and I've come to terms with the fact #onepiece might outlive me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I used to be so angry about #onepiece going on for seemingly forever with no end in sight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some nerd: wind waker was just Nintendo pandering to young kids!   Me: that is a post apocalyptic Zelda, friend #windwaker #LegendofZelda<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and now that magic has been destroyed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i just wanna remind ya'll that when the #SleepyHollow pilot came out the show got approved for a second season 24 hours later<|endoftext|>
