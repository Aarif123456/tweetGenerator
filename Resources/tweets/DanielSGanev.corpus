<|startoftext|>@RageTweet3 @KevinLowder4 @rocco__mx @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump @TwitterSafety @CNN I know and recognize the mistake I've said about the airplanes. Yes, sorry. You got me about that one.   But Trump is not all bad you know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RageTweet3 @KevinLowder4 @rocco__mx @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump @TwitterSafety @CNN No, there are "a lot" of conspirary theorists saying that air force was a much older that actually in 1947.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden @RageTweet3 20 days until you see how big you will lose to the patriots!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RageTweet3 @KevinLowder4 @rocco__mx @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump @TwitterSafety @CNN Karens are liberals, democrats...  How non-educated can you be to insult your own type of liberals.  Karens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RageTweet3 @KevinLowder4 @rocco__mx @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump @TwitterSafety @CNN Well, duh obviously the illegals are getting deported. No one "marched" south.   It's called deported.  ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RageTweet3 @KevinLowder4 @rocco__mx @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump @TwitterSafety @CNN Yes I do know about the air force. But they were starting to invent, and experiment so you are still wrong here. Omg this is actually fun to watch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RageTweet3 @KevinLowder4 @rocco__mx @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump @TwitterSafety @CNN Masks are dangerous. Are you dumb? Try and put on a mask all day and one day without it.  Come back and show me the results.  But! I know you will say that it will be the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RageTweet3 @KevinLowder4 @rocco__mx @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump @TwitterSafety @CNN And, no and yes the mexicans aren't invading the US. The illegals are. Those who come in the US for drug trafficking.   Donald J. Trump is talking about criminals, not all mexicans.  He in fact stated, that he loves Mexicans, but is there to stop the illegals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RageTweet3 @KevinLowder4 @rocco__mx @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump @TwitterSafety @CNN Yes, they did protect airfields.  Yes, masks are always putting bad air all day. We breathe the same air all day. At school, I feel suffocating, and acne.  No, it doesn't.  Yes, they did. As it is to stop mexican criminals to escape or to stop the illegals.  Yes they do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RageTweet3 @KevinLowder4 @rocco__mx @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump @TwitterSafety @CNN I can vote. I am american hahaha libs always trying to be passive agressive hahahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RageTweet3 @KevinLowder4 @rocco__mx @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump @TwitterSafety @CNN yes, those tweets I like because I want to put them in my liked section. But no, your "dumb donny" isn't trashing. He's just stating facts. He's the president of the U.S.A. He has done 100x more than any other president combined.Obama has killed more innocents than anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RageTweet3 @KevinLowder4 @rocco__mx @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump @TwitterSafety @CNN First, I did not like my own tweet.   Second, yes the CNN always uses terms as "we think", "maybe", "we are not sure but..."   That is not a trusted network. Real news like Fox News, always reports straight from the White House, something that the CNN try to do but always fail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RageTweet3 @KevinLowder4 @rocco__mx @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump @TwitterSafety It's not a conspiracy theory. It's a fact. The phone calls are official claims.   Don't refer yourself to @CNN  https://t.co/Abo9AOIEgy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is just hilarious! #America<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Senator Harris needs a psycho doctor.
