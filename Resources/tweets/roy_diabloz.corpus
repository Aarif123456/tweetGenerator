<|startoftext|>Majority of voters in US have made a decision to vote out a president who was racist.Kenyans should learn from this because our elections is always determined by our tribal lines.We recycle the same old leaders who have failed to deliver.#JoeBiden #USElectionResults2020 #CHESHU<|endoftext|>
