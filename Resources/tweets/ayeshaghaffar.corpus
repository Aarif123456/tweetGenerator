<|startoftext|>@salaamay B/c by and large these elements aren't part of our social fabric. It's being normalized even though it's a vice which doesn't need to be promoted. We cuss yes, but when media/art are weaved with cussing it allows kids to believe it's 'normal and OK' to do so. It's not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@salaamay Lots of things: all the cuss words that honestly didn't add to the narrative. I understand it's the character's requirement but that was definitely something that could've been toned down A scene where one of the character's is just wearing a bra. That's concerning<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#ImranKhan called Osama bin Laden a martyr on the floor of the assembly. I'm shocked.  How irresponsible and disgraceful for a PM to defend a mass terrorist. This will have a ripple effect and further aggravate the longstanding stance we've had against terrorism.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And I have said this on multiple occasions that PLEASE IF YOU CANNOT PROVIDE SUPPORT DON'T SAY THAT YOU'RE AROUND TO HELP. Because when a depressed person reaches out to you and you're unable to help or that you never follow through on a plan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It disgusts me when I see the outpouring of I wish we knew. I wish we understood. Most of y'all knew. You still didn't help #SushantSinghRajput please stop making excuses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is not as simple as don't do it. It's the years of emotional and mental exhaustion, the inability of people to read between the lines, provide support and just realize that if someone mentions they're depressed once, chances are 12 months after they still are<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An analogy here: it's like a tree that grew for hundreds of years and one day it fell down. Do you think it can stand back up? Of course, not.  Personally people have been concerned about my suicidal thoughts but believe me when I say this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not shocked but I'm surprised by the assumption that everyone has the same depression. No. We don't. Just because you were fortunate and lucky to have friends, the money to go to therapy and the strength to seek help, doesn't mean everyone does.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KhurramHusain I don't think there's anything wrong with that in fact, families who are already traumatised shouldn't be further traumatized by having to wait and know what happened to their loved ones. The information should be disseminated immediately without delay.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>More Indigenous people need to be on decision-making levels if we want to change this. I immediately think of 'the media doesn't tell you what to think but what to think about' and right now they're making sure we don't think about Indigenous people 7/10<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Adding Tanya Talaga's point from a discussion we had with her on Monday. I asked her the question about no coverage of Indigenous people during #COVID„Éº19 and she said, "as long as the people who make decisions are white, nothing is going to change. 6/10<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>üôå<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you, Shahzad. I feel so proud when journalists are unbiased and honest. This needed to be out for the world.  #EnoughIsEnough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4/4 If you are unable to understand the basics of this case, please don't indulge in mindless conversations. Please Google 'consent' and 'sexual harassment' understand your male privilege and then we can talk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3/4 She said the sexual harassment case was dismissed on technical grounds, specifically because Zafar and Meesha did not have the relationship of an employee and employer. That doesn‚Äôt mean the court thinks Shafi is at fault or guilty, she explained.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2/4  Adding that it was Zafar‚Äôs decision to come to court to hold a press conference. When asked to comment on Zafar‚Äôs comparison of Shafi to Malala Yousafzai, the lawyer said, We are proud of her and we surely want Shafi and all other Pakistani women to get the same respect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1/4 here's a quick "why isn't Meesha going to court" answer  Dad clarified, however, that Shafi has not been called by the court yet. She isn't afraid of appearing before the judge When her legal representatives are present in the court, why should she come for no reason?‚Äù<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbubakrMajeed I am so sorry for the women in your life honestly. It's disgusting, the mentality that you have. Please Google what consent means and like I always say educate yourself instead of being ignorant all the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbubakrMajeed Roz aik hee cheez poocho ge? She's not summoned by the court as Nighat Dad clarified. Jab court usko direct order bheje ga toh woh jaegi.  I hope this is clear now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Food for thought: why do I get a feeling that #AliZafar is basically running all these alleged fake accounts and pretension like Meesha is running them. It would make perfect sense given his recent series of tweets and public appearances.  #Metoo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sorry for women who still want to associate themselves with this absolutely vile man who thinks it's ok to victim blame that too on the basis of how one dresses. This behaviour is proof enough for the kind of man he is. I don't have words.  #EnoughIsEnough #metoo  https://t.co/LZcsAlbBXl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am baffled by HOW BOLLYWOOD is constantly changing views of the masses amidst the elections How is this even legal in any part of the world? Like for ffs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't even want to argue with people who think that 'it's bad humour and not insensitive' or 'it's not a big deal' because if you don't see a problem with jokes about oppressed people then you're part of the problem. #YasirHussain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By mocking the already marginalised community, you're normalizing trans jokes. #YasirHussain is playing a FEMALE character and if some people decided to leave insensitive comments, he could have shown some character and given them a shut up call. Way to use your position of power<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think people are missing a point here: nobody has a problem with #YasirHussain playing a female character, however, when he was asked about playing a trans he could have easily refuted the claim and moved on BUT noooo he makes it a point to prove that he's ignorant  Smh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kya achievement hai jaani<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you watch the drama #Cheekh that should help you understand how influential families function in our society and exactly how and why women continue to SUFFER in silence. #EnoughIsEnough #MeToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I LOVE you @itsmeeshashafi thank you for giving so many women the confidence to say #EnoughIsEnough though I have no faith in our justice system, know that people who are on the right track face the most difficult situations.  #meeshashafi #Metoo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I mean can you IMAGINE a Pakistani woman actually saying that and still be able to ATTEND a press conference? Yahan 'alleged harasser' ko defend kiya jaa raha hai blindly without any evidence whatsoever. Salam hai is awaam ko. #EnoughisEnough   https://t.co/Hvv0r8a45e<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PotterAsad What is the evidence of harassment? Maybe women should wear go pros on their heads so that they have 'evidence' that's the oldest and most stale argument in this entire conversation. Theresa plenty evidence if people are willing to see it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love this thread! Thanks @hamnazubair  Please read and educate yourself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's completely NORMAL for the Pakistani awaam ko believe Ali Zafar. Time and again we've proven that we are zealots. And that should be reason enough for our current state of affairs.  #EnoughisEnough #metoopakistan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh nuuuuuu @AliZafarsays ab kya hoga.. today's public sympathu performance gone to waste...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbubakrMajeed He is NOT innocent until proven guilty. And there's not court of law in Pakistan toh kaunsa justice milna hai idhar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Speaking of laws...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LahootiMelo It's extremely unfortunate. And then people want everyone to believe in the 'law' where 'justice is served' smh.  But thank you for being the voice of reason!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliZafarsays I believe aap ka #Timesup aur ab apna time aayega! If anyone should be worried it's you because if not in this world, you're going to be answerable in the better court of all where justice will always prevail, in the Hereafter.  #Metoo #EnoughIsEnough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Precisely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I mean why must anybody protect his identity? The entire nation knows who he is it's like everybody is pretending like they don't know who the accused here is.  #LSA19 #Metoo #EnoughIsEnough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why can't people just say Ali Zafar instead of saying 'alleged harasser' I mean why is there such hesitation to name a man who has in all likelihood harassed multiple women? Why didn't any of the nominees/publications name him? #LSA19 #Metoo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congratulations again @GaityKhan üôå<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YAASSS I AM THAT PERSON<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing like getting a confidence boost from other journalists. :')<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hamxx4 @Something_Haute Oh wow, this comes as a pleasant surprise! Thank you so much, it means a lot. ‚ù§‚ù§ hope to see you back in the scene soon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The uproar regarding #LSA19 is refreshing to see in an industry like ours which has time and again shied away from pressing matters. I'm glad that people are rising to the occasion. #MeToo #EnoughIsEnough #LSA2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If not you, who? If not now, when?  #LSA2019 #EnoughIsEnough #Metoo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BajiPlease Just because people do that all the time, how are you justifying that for the people who are the apparent flag bearers of 'change'? God forbid someone calls a goose a goose in Pakistan these days. The hostility is baffling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not even surprised that this was not on the news all day yesterday. No updates, no dedicated segment on @shazbkhanzdaGEO @AajKamranKhan show n we should all knw why. Pls send this govt away @PTIofficial  https://t.co/z1lOhHy95J<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It can't be a coincidence that EVERY TIME Sheikh Rasheed is appointed Minister of Railway all these accidents happen. Seriously isn't anybody noticing the pattern?  #PTI #wtfishappening  @PTIofficial @ShkhRasheed<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>LOLLLLLL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalljunaidKhan has completely recreated his actor persona with #Haniya on ARY. I could never see him ace a negative character but he truly has! Kudos to you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Haniya on ARY is probably the most underrated drama. This is the first Pakistani projects which has explored the emotional abuse women go through when in toxic relationships @Qasimalimureed phenomenal stuff!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Idk what the butthurt on #MehwishHayat being honoured with Tamgha-i-Imtiaz was about? How many 'woke af' from your lot achieved something as much as her in less than 10 years? Ya, so sit down b/c can't hear you over the sound of her success  @MehwishHayat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woah ‚ù§‚ù§<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watched the #PatriotAct episode on Indian elections before watching the    #PMNarendraModiTrailer and that made it 10x more unbelievable. What a load BS if anybody believe the film  Also, Iraq says wassup @hasanminhaj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also that last dialogue gives Chowkidar Modi (that's literally his name rn) the edge to win since majority Hindus love to hate on Muslims or Pakistan @narendramodi #PMNarendraModiTrailer<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>1/2  #BrentonTarrant martyred almost 50+ Muslims and he has ONLY been charged for MURDER? He said, ‚ÄúI only wish I could have killed more invaders, and more traitors as well.‚Äù  Publication saying he's 'accused'  #NewZealandTerroristAttack<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm traumatized after watching the #NewZealandTerroristAttack video. I dnt have any reach but what are people with influence doing about it? What was the fault of those 40 Muslim men?
