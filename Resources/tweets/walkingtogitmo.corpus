<|startoftext|>@pattonoswalt What a leader!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickKristof Trump ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt want the numbers to go up‚Äù. Therefore, no testing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mediajunkie The strategy of not testing anyone and not asking them any questions at all is quintessentially Trumpian, and sadly "working" in the sense that nobody has even the faintest idea how many active cases are wandering around in lower Manhattan or anywhere else. Love the avatar!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So our military budget is x quintillion dollars to ‚Äúprotect the American people,‚Äù but that mountain of loot doesn‚Äôt do anything to combat coronavirus. Maybe divert some $ to a public healthcare infrastructure?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So, the best candidate finished last, a mediocre many-time career loser triumphed, and we‚Äôre well-positioned for a repeat of 2016. The only good news seems to be that you cannot literally buy the presidency. Yay, America!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MelanesianKumul Yes, and Toyota has important factories here. Once, in the late 1980s, I was sleeping in my rented Nissan in a parking lot in Florida, and I woke to some men banging on the car roof and shaking it. I rolled the window down about an inch. They freaked out. "it's a rental," I said.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Attacking Trump for raising the specter of, gasp, possible Muslims amongst the marchers does exactly what he wants to do, which is demonize. It implies that there would be something wrong if there were "middle easterners" marching. What would that wrong thing be?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm outraged by the media response to Trump's dog-whistling regarding "Middle Eastern" ppl participating in the so-called migration caravan in Mexico. Instead of complaining that he made it up, they should be asking why on earth it would matter, if true. 1/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshleyRParker In other words, what is the difference between a Syrian refugee walking across Mexico, and a Honduran one?<|endoftext|>
