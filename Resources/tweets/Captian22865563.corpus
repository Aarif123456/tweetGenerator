<|startoftext|>Everyone in #yyc should watch this.  CPS needs change and proper civilian oversight.  I had hope in @neufeld_mark but he has so far proven to be no better.  Hope this changes and he starts taking proper responsibility.   @CalgaryPolice   https://t.co/2VoGTAkjWv<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>$NETE Comparatively, 0.8% of Evertec shares are owned by company insiders. Strong institutional ownership is an indication that endowments, large money managers and hedge funds believe a company is poised for long-term growth.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Deaths so far this year.  Abortions ~16MM Cornavirus ~300k  Response  Abortions - our body our right  Cornavirus - not allowed out of your house and governments looking to push mandatory vaccines  Seems logical<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ValiantThor12 @Stars4P Agreed, church people generally good though<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jkenney Are you paying for all the business losses on this last minute fumble? ICU less than 2% capacity in Calgary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ItsCaufieldSZN @jkenney @CMOH_Alberta Brutal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jkenney @CMOH_Alberta First province to put in place a tracking app and now this bullshit delayed opening. Gyms which keep people healthy open when exactly?  Really disappointed lifetime UCP supporter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#OBAMAGATE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jkenney @CMOH_Alberta I am a lifetime conservative voter.  Open up. ICU empty. Let people make thier own decisions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@saucy1234567 @jkenney @CMOH_Alberta People can choose to stay home. No way I will get a vaccine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jkenney @CMOH_Alberta ICU in Calgary below 2% capacity.  Stop restricting and treating us like criminals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jkenney @CMOH_Alberta Kenney act like Texas.  This is wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mcleish_walter @jkenney @CMOH_Alberta Agreed this is a joke.  Power hungry politicians<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nenshi quit abusing power.  I thought we lived in a free country.  You need to resign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YourAlberta @jkenney @CMOH_Alberta Let the restrictions off, I need to support my family.  Quit with this hyped up daily scare tactic.  Advise older people to stay locked down. Let the virus take its course we have lots of ICU room. @jkenney<|endoftext|>
