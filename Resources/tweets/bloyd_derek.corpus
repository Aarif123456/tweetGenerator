<|startoftext|>@CarmineSabia, dude, you're the one sounding like an attention whore. That's your whole bag. Do u have a moral compass?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ezrocks0011 We have hopes of moving back to Texas.  It's a long range plan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ezrocks0011 To too many people black lives just don't matter. It's always been that way. If you look at my profile pic my son is in the black shirt (behind me.) Witnessing what he's gone through changed me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ezrocks0011 My black son was pulled over by the cops 13 times in 1st 3.5 months he had his license. Never a ticket or arrested but searched allot &amp; harassed. I'm wht &amp; was pulled over 2 times in 20 years. Both times my son was in the front seat next to me. His reality is different than mine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ezrocks0011 That's not true. The difference is cops keep getting away with it. White on white, black on black, and brown on brown crimes safely happen but all those crimes look to be solved BUT when a cop is involved that crime is often ignored. That's the issue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ezrocks0011 That isn't the BLM movement. If u see a conservative breaking the law do u assume all conservatives are evil? If a friend named Joe pisses u off do u get mad at all people named Joe or do u understand that that one Joe was wrong?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ezrocks0011 @NBA @HoustonRockets I wish you well too!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ezrocks0011 @NBA @HoustonRockets I was the one recording the video and everyone was peaceful. The iowa governor had nothing to do with the peaceful march. Most people in this state can't stand her. She will likely lose the next election by a huge margin. She's immoral just like Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ezrocks0011 @NBA @HoustonRockets The news doesn't show the peaceful marches. Here's one from Des Moines.  https://t.co/kv5Qf1b6uJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ezrocks0011 @NBA @HoustonRockets It can be different in the mid west. I lived over 30 years in my hometown Beaumont Tx but in Iowa (where there aren't as many minorities) it's different. For example it's harder for minorities to get a good job. It's a good ol boy club and they stick together against minorities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ezrocks0011 @NBA @HoustonRockets We just don't know for certain what Dr. King would do but I'm positive he wouldn't support any of the illegal activity and he would support the peaceful aspect of the movement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ezrocks0011 @NBA @HoustonRockets In my opinion Dr. King inspired the BLM movement but not everyone follows his tactics. I have white, black, &amp; hispanic family members &amp; all of us are inspired by the outpouring of support for black lives. Lift up those who were ignored and mistreated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ezrocks0011 @NBA @HoustonRockets The people that respectfully support the BLM movement have given my family encouragement. Encouragement that there are many good people who are willing to demand change &amp; equality for all. I'm not ok with the illegal activity but I support the movement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ezrocks0011 @NBA @HoustonRockets U are ignorant dude. Raise a black child and u will see racism. I couldn't believe how hateful people can be all because of skin color.

<|startoftext|>@Qanon45th @ShesQualified @CptnMustered @Bethass1 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump I never said we do but i think me not supporting Trump would be one. To each their own. I just can't support a liar.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KwikWarren Politics swing on a pendulum.  We elect a black man who tried to unite the world.  They don't like the new reality.  They elect a divide &amp; rule president who preaches that he will bring them back to when the country WAS great.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Lancegooden Lance Gooden, leading involves working accross party lines &amp; needing all leaders to be reasonable &amp; good 4 the country. Not openly wishing them a disaster.

<|startoftext|>@CA55Jake I just saw a tweet that said this is how Iowa will handle voting at tonight's caucus.  https://t.co/c2CXYv1NCj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CA55Jake jodi Ernst's is a GOP droid. Nothing more than a robot to use at their discretion. Her decisions are trash. We have quite a few of them here in Iowa.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CA55Jake I know many republicans are looking at options, hoping to see a dem they can stomach. Generally these people are private so they are difficult to read.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CA55Jake At the door you can switch parties. I live in Union County Ia (from Beaumont Tx) &amp; union co is red. Below is the breakdown of Nov 2016 voting. There are lots of Dem volunteers here trying to incourage voting.  https://t.co/O8qVyRmEZO<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WisdomDavee Also, if Fiers sent nude pics then he may be in a tough spot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WisdomDavee From what i read an authority figure in Michigan is when their social status is revered &amp; the younger person feels pressure and intimidation to ebey. He may or may not meet that criteria but i imagine the law officials may look into it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DncjlahsnsbJ @WisdomDavee I was born &amp; raised in Beaumont Tx &amp; my wife &amp; kids are from there too but we are stuck in Iowa for now. Hope to make it back soon!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DebasaurusRex Its 18 "IF" Michigan authorities consider Fiers an authority figure. His status as a pro athlete just might do that.  https://t.co/mVZfD76lsT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WisdomDavee 1st off im no expert but the age is 18 in Michigan if the older person is an authority figure. It would be up to Michigan authorities to determine if Mike Fiers meets that criteria.  https://t.co/Uf8PZsvsoo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@band_again @starrIIight Best and most accurate tweet of the year!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@torided @starrIIight I can't imagine how anyone could prefer dead over autistic. It's beyond comprehension! Not wanting to get vaccinated because of the real risks doesn't mean they hate the disabled. Throwing a blanket over a complex problem and giving everyone under it the same name is careless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@starrIIight If anyone would prefer a dead child to an autistic child they are SICK. I can't imagine that type of mindset. But if u want an honest discussion then I would avoid saying they hate disabled people if they avoid vacs. Invite a discussion, don't start by offending them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@torided @starrIIight What in the ever loving heck are u talking about? I have autistic fam members &amp; they are no less precious and loved than anyone else. All I said is the rationale she used that they "hate" disabled people if they were too scared to use vaccinations is off. It doesn't fit them all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@band_again @starrIIight I agree with u 100% but my point is this doesnt mean those parents "hate" disabled people. It likely means they got scared. Its her rationale that i disageeed with. It takes away from the credibility of the vaccine debate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@starrIIight My kids were vaccinated but I think your rationale is twisted. Trying to keep your child from a lifelong disability is a worthy act just as vaccinations are. Its not a #UHateDisabledPeople thing. Its a "what i think is the lesser evil" thing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@steven_maines @DetroitSteel_ Thank u &amp; I too understand how it lingers, even years later. I'm 50 and my mom committed suicide on Christmas eve night 1972. In a way I make myself stay upset at her because the moment I "accept" her decision, I soften &amp; I too could see that as an acceptable door. Take care!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DetroitSteel_ So i say go reboot your mind with sleep. Keep doing that and keep pushing through. Get in a brighter more cheerful enviornment. I wish someone would have helped my mom do that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DetroitSteel_ If its suicide u r referring to, the answer is maybe, maybe not. My mom killed herself when I was 3 and my brother was 6. Her abandoning her problems created many horrible life-long problems for us. It may even give ideas to your loved ones. My moms mom eventually did the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KwikWarren Im wht, mixed son had been asked 2 leave a few homes of friends when a parent 1st saw him. Each time was shocking &amp; altered his life.

<|startoftext|>@ElwoodBrew2 On one hand I agree with u.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElwoodBrew2 It was a bad idea. Many conservatives are watching the dem debates wondering if they could find a dem they could stomach.

<|startoftext|>@McSpareMe @realBradfordM I dont trust politicians but Trump is a special case. I dont have to believe conspiracy theories about him because he lies so often that I can judge him by his own words and actions.  Have a good night! Thanks for the respectful conversation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McSpareMe @realBradfordM What are u refering to?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McSpareMe @realBradfordM I dont think hes fighting globalism but he is breaking up our allies. I like that he was against NAFTA but overall hes the opposite of a good leader. Hes a "divide and rule" guy and history shows us that will end in a disaster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McSpareMe @realBradfordM Im not so much a "political party guy". I vote for the lesser evil. I have many conservative views but i believe in allowing people to be themselves.

<|startoftext|>@anthonycdemaria Nope<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KwikWarren I disagree!

<|startoftext|>@SirPacoCrisp Thank u for your kind words! If the below quote is true then u are a refreshing wind. There are so many mean and selfish people in this world that when I do meet a kind one it can leave me speechless.  Thanks for being a kind one!  https://t.co/cYq9U9HFI4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SirPacoCrisp I agree that staying silent is bad but 100% facts are needed before publicly condemning (in my opinion.)  I just dont know what that guy actually said or did to the reporters. There are conflicting accounts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SirPacoCrisp For people like that they need to stay away from alcohol. I would rather rehabilitate an alcoholic than someone who abused with a sober mind. That was my point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SirPacoCrisp As i said alcohol is not an excuse BUT it does change people. I grew up with a dad who was an alcoholic and my mother killed herself while drunk late on Christmas eve night when i was young. When u are drunk u are different.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshBrianBeltr2 He already had a great % against Strasburg After that at-bat Bregman is now 3 for 4 overall. Altuve was 2 of 5 before tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SirPacoCrisp Alcohol does not justify it BUT if drinking changed a person then alcohol was the problem. If it wasnt and those acts happened with a sober mind then that speaks to deeper issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SirPacoCrisp Im not proud of the fact that the Astros traded for him but trading for him isnt the same as defending what he did. I do not know the details but i am wondering if alcohol was involved in both incidents. Im 100% against domestic violence but i do believe in 2nd chances.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SirPacoCrisp Honest question: how did the Astros organization DEFEND domestic violence?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pill_reggie @zmann @LindseyMastis There are still children seperated from their families at the border. Young children. He didnt lock up the mother and child together like Obama did. He pulled them apart. For 2 years some have been seperated. No good excuse or reason for that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pill_reggie @zmann @LindseyMastis "We" is not accurate. "U"maybe is. Trump himself has made his opinion clear. He is the leader of that movement. In your case it may be another subject. For me he crossed many moral lines. I can't even recognise a moral compass in Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pill_reggie @zmann @LindseyMastis Therefor u allow him free rein. Hes fighting your war. No rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pill_reggie @zmann @LindseyMastis I wonder if the reason we see Trump differently is hidden in cultural discourse. In other words discourse may dictate reality because it gives an assumption that was born from that culture. Your culture sees u as a victim. Immigrants are your main issue. Trump is your rescuer.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@waltwhiteandblu @RockoMulcahy @seanbnbad Trump plays a "divide and rule" game that was successful for many leaders of the past. Hitler used it.

<|startoftext|>@waltwhiteandblu @RockoMulcahy @seanbnbad If u speak the truth like that u will sway more people. U attract more bees with honey than vinegar.

<|startoftext|>@waltwhiteandblu @RockoMulcahy @seanbnbad I have a good perspective. This is some of my family. I'm not in the pic. Things were great for us until the last 2 years. My box sucks.

<|startoftext|>@waltwhiteandblu @RockoMulcahy @seanbnbad Please don't let them bring u down. To truely make a difference we must stay level headed while realizing people are divided &amp; desperate.

<|startoftext|>@waltwhiteandblu @RockoMulcahy @seanbnbad When we can stop comparing trump to Obama &amp; stop rationalizing this like "but he was bad too" then we actually have a chance to improve this country. Until then we are pawns in the divide &amp; rule game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waltwhiteandblu @RockoMulcahy @seanbnbad Lol. Please use your intelligence. I don't kiss up to anyone who attacks anyone. I voted Republican against Obama on his re-election but i worked on his campaign the first election (local stuff.) I vote for character &amp; trump lies &amp; manipulates. His bad side outweighs his good.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@waltwhiteandblu @RockoMulcahy @seanbnbad What is your point? I didn't say all violence was trumps fault.

Where I'm at they bust your Windows and yell slurrs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waltwhiteandblu @RockoMulcahy @seanbnbad The attacks started when they felt emboldened "there are good people on both sides." Im just starting facts.

<|startoftext|>@waltwhiteandblu @RockoMulcahy @seanbnbad This is my 16 year old. His 1st 5 months of driving he was pulled over by the cops at least 15 times.

<|startoftext|>@waltwhiteandblu @RockoMulcahy @seanbnbad Maybe you are right but I'm guessing by the guns on your necklace &amp; the cops in the pic u were raised on the outskirts of town (Maybe Texas but certainly the South) away from seeing how many minorities are treated on a daily basis &amp; why so many people are upset. U just don't know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waltwhiteandblu @RockoMulcahy This isn't gang warfare where we trash the other side at every turn. U do u though. Spread your twisted narrow hate filled view IF that is who u choose to be. But i have a feeling u r only looking for approval from conservatives instead of standing up for what is right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waltwhiteandblu @RockoMulcahy It takes a small minded person to cast everyone they don't agree with into one stereotype.

<|startoftext|>@hotchef9 @TraciLynnWiley1 @jwheels74 There's some old hate laws on the books that need to be removed.

The law was on the books until 1975, when Governor Bond rescinded what was known as the extermination order.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hotchef9 @TraciLynnWiley1 @jwheels74 I talked to him and thanked him.

<|startoftext|>@hotchef9 @TraciLynnWiley1 @jwheels74 The families threatened to sue a cops son who exposed the picture &amp; threatened to sue the school.

In the end even legal experts agreed the school had no case &amp; had to relent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hotchef9 @TraciLynnWiley1 @jwheels74 This is what happened &amp; why they didn't go to jail.

<|startoftext|>@TraciLynnWiley1 @jwheels74 @hotchef9 They had the right to take the pic because of the first amendment.

<|startoftext|>@Truthaholic47 I respect your view but thats not how everyone sees politics. Some people who once didn't vote chose to vote for Trump because they saw him as someone who aligned with their separatist views. The fact that Trump is known to keep copies of Hitlers book fuels those people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Truthaholic47 @AmericaISgrea12 They took off running after yelling. I was tempted to run them down but I stopped myself &amp; called the cops.

<|startoftext|>@jwheels74 As a Wht dad this was my wake up call: Blk son 1st 5 months driving-pulled over at least 15 times &amp; searched maybe half.

<|startoftext|>@BulldogShadow @jwheels74 Thank you! However I feel any dad should do that.  It took having a black child to realize his freedoms are different than mine. I would hope that would wake any parent up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BulldogShadow @jwheels74 In truth he just doesn't open up about his feelings very often and seems to see doing that as a weakness but every once in a while when something bad happens, like our front window getting busted out during the night or something fearful like that he opens up and talks.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Deborah32314612 @jwheels74 @hotchef9 Yes the news story was almost 11 months ago.  This is when the real troubles started here. This is when some of the locals started vandalizing our house and my son started getting death threats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@werzadnan they were sophomores and juniors in high school.  Not kidding.  4 of the 5 were my sons good friends.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BulldogShadow @jwheels74 I cried. I have a fathers pain but he has a victims pain. I see him growing angry and frustrated &amp; all I can do at times is pray &amp; guide him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jwheels74 This happens when your son grows up thinking he has solid friends since elementary school.  Then one day they take a picture &amp; he suddenly stops trusting people. My son is named Austin and u can see him if u watch the video.   https://t.co/cOlHUIWN9O<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hotchef9 @jwheels74 I think we did that but then this happened when he was 15. It rocked his world and has only gotten worse.

<|startoftext|>@hotchef9 @jwheels74 It hurts me but I understand its a fathers pain. He has a victims pain. He said sometimes he wonders what it would be like to not be black but the thought of being white, the only color that hates so much, is beyond what he would ever choose. Heartbreaking stuff!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jwheels74 My blk son cried telling me because I'm white I'll never know how it feels.  It was because I stopped the car in a wht-hood to throw a toy from the street into a yard he freaked out and ducked down &amp; said he didn't want ANOTHER gun pulled. He said "I can't stop just anywhere dad"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'd like to add that the death threats and damage to our house wasn't done by the ones in the pic as far as I can tell. They did seem a bit remorseful.  4 of the 5 have been to our house and were his good friends while 3 had spent the night here. He no longer talks to any of them<|endoftext|>

We have for a president a dimwitted racist with 0 empathy who abides by Roger Stones stated belief that "it's better to be infamous than not famous at all."

<|startoftext|>@shannamcgregor @CyrusMMcQueen Just like political maps show red &amp; blue after an election u can see where most of the racists live.

Their kids never witness the beautiful qualities of different races &amp; only hear separatist ideals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BL_St1 @KwikWarren In this case it was while we were asleep. My son had received threats on his phone and at school. It was all race related. Our town made national news because of racism. 4 of the 5 in the pic were his good friends before the photo. Still we don't know who did the vandalism  https://t.co/7zTO3JcHza<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KwikWarren One thing I've learned (FWIW I was born &amp; raised in Texas) is that worrying or debating why or how the Dallas Mavericks devise any of their plans (with few exceptions)  puts us one step closer to an aneurysm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stutteringjohnm Forget #Trump! U need to look out your windows for those red hats &amp; gun barrels. My suggestion is to put a "i support the free press" sign in the yard across the street. That may give u a little time to escape. Good luck!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KwikWarren I'm not saying dallas is right. I'm saying i understand IF the circumstances befit the plan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KwikWarren Cousins is clearly a better all around player but the right fit, the right skill can be everything. Look at what Dennis Rodman did for Detroit (2 rings) &amp; when he switched to Chicago (3 rings) he made them so much better. Rodman only averaged 7.3 points a game over his career.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1Sportsislife @KwikWarren Exactly! If they want their system to continue then they wouldn't want a guy who will change their system. They need a Clint Capella type who will accept his role on both ends. A catch &amp; dunk type which is exactly what jordan is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KwikWarren unless they only want a catch and dunk guy who accepts his role. Like Capella of the rockets. With cousins u get a guy who appears to want to be more of the focal point &amp; may alter their system. I say this but i don't keep up with dallas' system. i don't know what they want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KwikWarren I was born and raised near Houston and i went to Lamar university which Louisiana tech was at the time rivals with. Karl Malone is a legend down there. I'll admit i am a bit biased.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MercyMeMerica @MimiFrancoPhoto @dianeault5 @krassenstein @GOP With all due respect we see things differently but i don't necessarily go by the media news. I believe "by their fruits you shall know them." Trump produces vile fruit that poisons. That is how i see things.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CA55Jake When she contacted me i looked up her profile to see who she follows. My alarm went off because she followed just men with no obvious rhyme or reason. She was fishing 4 men.

<|startoftext|>@pdjf1 @KerfuffleBuff @seanhannity @CNN @MSNBC @OANN @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews I don't know for a fact what the true intention of politicians &amp; others are so i have to go by their actions. I wish i trusted trump but i don't. He's a loose cannon &amp; lies daily.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@W_T_F_smh @JackPosobiec They likely put their own guys in place but that is no proof anyone is dishonest &amp; making up evidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@W_T_F_smh @JackPosobiec It's divide and rule, not divide and conquer. I can't answer your question if i don't agree anyone stacks the fbi to attack anyone else. To use your argument they do stack judges in their favor. They put their guys in place. That is normal. The fbi idea is a an exaggeration<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@W_T_F_smh @JackPosobiec #Trump is a divide and rule President. Creating enemies to keep his base angry. Its an old &amp; sad political tactic. He uses manipulation and lies when he wants. He exaggerates about the fbi &amp; the news as a tool to manipulate &amp; control others . No integrity! #Resist #TheResistance<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KerfuffleBuff @pdjf1 @seanhannity @CNN @MSNBC @OANN @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Another way to look at it is no one can control your street fighter. He ignores the law &amp; thinks he's above it. Now we have a lunatic in charge &amp; he's burning bridges while breaking laws &amp; he chooses if &amp; when we go to war. He decides if baby's are ripped away from familys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glozee1 He gets a trial but just like u or me Manafort can't tamper with witnesses. Its a serious felony. He was caught red handed. Now whats with all the gang like behavior.

<|startoftext|>@KerfuffleBuff @pdjf1 @seanhannity @CNN @MSNBC @OANN @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Kennedy explains here what #Trump ended up doing that is so destructive. Trump didn't just lie but he convinced people of a myth. That the U.S. judiciary system is evil &amp; cant be trusted. He's destroying the fabric of our country so he can stay out of jail. This is why I #Resist  https://t.co/Uudqi0AppR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KerfuffleBuff @pdjf1 @seanhannity @CNN @MSNBC @OANN @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Its all about perspective i guess. In my opinion a president doesn't divide. He brings everyone up to meet his higher standard while being the example.  Reagan was good at that as was Roosevelt, Obama, &amp; Kennedy. This is, in my opinion, one of his biggest failures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KerfuffleBuff @pdjf1 @seanhannity @CNN @MSNBC @OANN @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews I usually let the politicians talk &amp; then i compare that to their actions. I'll read some news stories but they usually just inspire me to read direct quotes. Trump plays the "divide and rule" game &amp; is pretty good at it. That's basically how i summed him up based on his actions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KerfuffleBuff @pdjf1 @seanhannity @CNN @MSNBC @OANN @realDonaldTrump If he had a great character &amp; didn't lie or care so little for those kids at the border &amp; if he treated people in general with kindness (plus many many other things) then he could have gone down as a good President. But that's not him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KerfuffleBuff @pdjf1 @seanhannity @CNN @MSNBC @OANN @realDonaldTrump I'll will never settle for a liar &amp; criminal. Its like choosing a spouse. U must choose someone who lifts u up &amp; makes u a better person. If not u will become less of a person as their influence takes its toll. This is happening to our country. Character matters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pdjf1 @KerfuffleBuff @seanhannity @CNN @MSNBC @OANN I disagree that nothing would get done. If the right person is elected and they have the congressional &amp; Senate votes then lots can get done. My issue is I think Trump may be insane &amp; is manipulative as well as a huge lair. The problem is who can be trusted and relied upon?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pdjf1 @KerfuffleBuff @seanhannity @CNN @MSNBC @OANN He was Trump but without the baggage or lies (no offense.) It was my first time voting &amp; I remember hearing him say 'if we sign NAFTA u will hear a giant sucking sounds going south, and that will be our jobs." He split the conservative vote which handed Clinton the election.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AllisonRFloyd @Cha51brolll19 And they wonder how we can say they have fallen off of their moral high horse.  Much of the Republican party is following their leader by displaying hatred at anyone who disagrees with their view. #Trump is their fuhrer and like Hitler he will destroy much if left unchecked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnrogers93  https://t.co/IaE7G90715  Watch the video at the link and u will see my son. His name is Austin.  It got way worse after this. Way worse.  4 of the 5 were his good friends for years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnrogers93 I don't see the racists when I'm out. They attack my house and have driven my son out of the local school. They have been much more bold this last year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnrogers93 @sally_field @realcandace I don't think trying to bring people together (Obama) and give them hope was what led to a racial problem. Maybe the problem was in the eyes of those who didn't like how far the pendulum swung when a black man was elected. This is in part why Trump won. The pendulum swung back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnrogers93 I'm white and my son is black and I've seen enough this last year to convince me his freedom is different than mine. If u are a minority u would already know how bad things are and were before Obama took office AND how they have gotten worse (in a couple of ways) since he left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnrogers93 @sally_field @realcandace Out of curiosity how do u see that Obama causes a racial divide? I'm really trying to be open minded. Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnrogers93 @sally_field @realcandace My original post was about the right stepping off their moral high ground. They once demanded politicians tell the truth &amp; had a moral compass that guided them. That they respected the laws and upheld then. Now that is gone. Maybe not in your eyes but to much of America it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnrogers93 @RealCandaceO @DiamondandSilk @TallahForTrump There is a common believe among many racist business owners and that is when it comes to money they only see green but that is where they draw the line.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnrogers93 @RealCandaceO @DiamondandSilk @TallahForTrump FWIW I do not watch msm, nbc, cbs, abc, cnn or fox. The last place i would ever get factual information on #trump is fox. I watched them for years and realized they are just a lieing mouthpiece.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnrogers93 @RealCandaceO @DiamondandSilk @TallahForTrump So we are talking about racism and u go to the "get this gentleman off the plantation" line.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MMREMTP @sally_field U are a bit naive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnrogers93 @sally_field @realcandace Your link is to a Phineas &amp; Ferb cartoon twitter page. Anyway back to reality. I'm guessing u think MLK was racist too. Why do u think Obama was racist?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnrogers93 Lol. Racism didn't start with trump and i never said that however his actions emboldened them. It's common knowledge some racist groups see Trump as a racist &amp; that he will not go after them.  I'm glad u don't have to deal with it but my family has.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@movedtoGab Theres so much more &amp; builds higher daily but that should give u an idea. I'm a believer in a person having a moral compass &amp; he doesnt seem to have one. We are at the mercy of whatever it is he wants to do from day to day &amp; he will attack anyone who stands in his path. Dangerous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@movedtoGab # 3. He's not all bad. I support changing NAFTA &amp; some other economic changes but he appears morally corrupt &amp; it hurts seeing a president who is alienating us from good people as well as long time loyal countries because it doesn't fit his current agenda (who knows what it is.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@movedtoGab Im a fan of history &amp; u can see the same path when u look back at morally corrupt dictators. They build up their base by saying it's us against them. They want personal loyalty around them instead of people who are loyal to the law. We are on a dangerous path<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@movedtoGab Leadership is like Kennedy, Reagan or Lincoln. Those men respected people and seemed to tell the truth. Now it's like a king of the hill game. No ethics, just bash anyone down the hill. CIA, FBI, judges, anyone who disagrees with him he attacks &amp; he's cought in lies daily.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MMREMTP @sally_field Let's put this into perspective. Pretend theres a street fight in front of your house. 1 side was a group that hated &amp; attacked some white people &amp; the other side was protesting. Then Obama says 'Well, there were good people on both sides.' That would have emboldened the racists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@movedtoGab Thanks for that. I know what u said is true. FWIW my original post was based on Republican party once would've been ashamed of things trump has done (had moral high ground) but now they seem to say "well the other side does wrong too so..." They stepped off the moral high ground.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This Republican insists Obama unleashed the racial divide we now face. #Resistance #resist #Brainwashed! #TRUMP  https://t.co/PT4NBdXu7R<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnrogers93 @sally_field Good for u! That's a positive however if u think Obama unleashed racism and Trump hasn't emboldened racists u seem to live a sheltered life and have a news source that avoids or tries to discredit actual events.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makabba07 @sally_field In the end the truth will come out and then we will all know. Until that time let's avoid the propaganda machines.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dottybrug @sally_field If KNOWING a criminal such as Harvey makes you guilty or nuts then by your own definition Trump supporters are nuts. You guys elected a guy who admitted he sexually assaulted women. Maybe take a moment and understand how #Trump supporters are viewed outside of your rallies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Patrici15944360 @sally_field Facts first. I never really knew my mother. She committed suicide when i was 3. She quit life. I need no sympathy. If u are against the left because they are "criminals" then why in God's name are u supporting one right now?  The moral compass of the right is at an all time low<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MMREMTP @sally_field My house has been vandalized and we have had death threats all because the emboldened racists hate that my son is black. It never happened until a few months after Trump was elected. He emboldened them. He said they are good people.   I will resist that kind of leadership!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bro98136850Emma @sally_field It's sad but u just proved my point about moral high-ground.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@movedtoGab @sally_field The hate here has gone through the roof. The racists who were once quiet have become emboldened and try to make life hell. Is really bad. We had to take our son out of the local school.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@movedtoGab @sally_field I stay way from the news for the most part.  The dangers of the way Trump thinks and acts became a serious issue a few months after the election. Years ago i adopted a black son and since trump was elected our house has been attacked many times and we have received death threats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnrogers93 @sally_field I don't watch CNN &amp; who is Acosta. Let me give u some facts but i doubt u will care. As soon as #Trump was elected racists gave my family death threats &amp; vandalized our home many times. Trump has emboldened them. It's getting worse for many of us. There are 2 Americas. It's evil<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@movedtoGab @sally_field Do u have any clue how a democracy works? How it was designed? How 2 parties keep each other in check. How 2 parties each have their own strengths and weaknesses and together (if it works) the country flourishes. unfortunately it has become gang warfare with their own propaganda<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@movedtoGab @sally_field ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EddieSavageSS @sally_field U are correct i would assume. And your point was?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makabba07 @sally_field Let's say u are correct then why would u want 2 back to back criminals leading the country? Make a stand! I couldn't care less which party they are in, if they are a criminal I want them out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deborahann770 @sally_field I agree that much more should have been done to help the economy &amp; the issues started with NAFTA which both Bush and Clinton supported (Ross Perot was against). Study history &amp; Hitler who helped their economy but then destroyed Germany with his behavior. The signs are there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnrogers93 @sally_field A #Trump supporter calling us delusional means we are doing just fine. He's got you all thinking ass-backwards and believing his lies. Between fox news, the morning tweet lies and the rallies u guys are all twisted up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MMREMTP @sally_field So racism is nothing to u. I'm guessing u are used to it and accept it. Your reaction to my earlier tweet proves the republicans are losing their moral high-ground. Come on and prove it some more genius.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@movedtoGab @sally_field I actually don't want them to be over. I want them to be decent and trustworthy. Together both parties will aid in the democracy, keeping each-other in check. This is how it should be but your fuhrer is dividing us with hate and refusing to help. Do u not see it?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@movedtoGab @tmather1960 @sally_field To Fox news? Not anymore. They are hateful and liars. I mostly stay away from the main news outlets. Avoid the propaganda. Turns us against each other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsox007 No of course not silly! It's his racist acts that make him racist.  His actions mostly seem insane but i do agree with changing NAFTA. He's a hot head and is ruining this countries reputation. Smh...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MMREMTP @sally_field Neither, my racist hate-monger half brother. Once I stopped watching fox news the hate disappeared and the truth became clearer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tmather1960 @sally_field To flaw is human but to continue over and over and over means that is who you have become. This is the difference and that is what Trump is. I was more of a Republican before Trump but I will now resist! We are on the moral high ground watching the Republican party crash &amp; die!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaymondTague3 @fogslifting @sally_field Theres allot of propaganda out there that needs to be avoided but the most vile and deceitful is fox. Still I try to avoid all of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sally_field The moral high ground of the #Republican party is over. They revered &amp; elected a hateful, vulger, racist criminal to the highest office this world has. Their credibility is shot. If they want to stop their free-fall quit supporting a criminal. Stand for decency! #Resist #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fogslifting @sally_field Too me its not left or right. In many ways those are just gang colors. I see what u said as just rude. U start off by saying she is a has been which to me shows u have some nasty inside of u. If u want to get rid of it turn off the propaganda (#FoxNews) &amp; the hate will melt away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@562Lori Thank you for this!!! My adopted son (mixed race blk &amp; wht) has dealt with death threats and our house was vandalized all because of race issues where we live. The race issues here made national news. He switched to an online school to deal with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@562Lori Just a tip. I may be wrong for doing this but when a teen is sleeping u can touch their phone to their finger (if they use the fingerprint lock.) I did this a time or two to get the full picture of things.  A sneaky parent may be annoying but when they save u from trouble it's ok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rocketfan2503 Then u must fly back to California &amp; run around the airport 7 times (naked &amp; draped in an Astros flag) while literally screaming "the essence of Billy Wagner will now enter the Astros' relievers!" It's no guarantee but I think it's worth a shot.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rufusdrl @brycetache I agree! I think that might be what happened when the press came to my son and did those interviews. After that the police backed off. I'm not sure if they suddenly respected him or they didn't want to chance the exposure since he was already talking to the press about racism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rufusdrl @brycetache I thought about it but honestly it got better.  The saddest part is how it got better. If you Google my son's name "Austin" with my last name and look under "news" you will see that he had a racial situation at his school and how he dealt with it caused the police to respect him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@treymromero I'm a Cowboys fan and still thought that was funny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TuttlePatriarch @Eagles @dallascowboys David Akers needs to jump up and down to get his balls to drop.  That voice!  He sounded like a 13 year-old<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@David2Akers needs to jump up and down to get his testes to drop!  That voice!  #eagles #DallasCowboys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GCSaints12 He has hands but not a great blocker yet and the Cowboys likes a tight end that can block.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VictorTebow @dallascowboys @SuttonCourtland @TroyFumagalli I'm a big Fumagalli fan!  He just makes plays!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ToddHebert FWIW The report I just read said the deal is contingent on #EarlThomas signing a long term deal with #DallasCowboys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@babetcohen @StephaneAtkins7 @OliverMcGee @realDonaldTrump @DHSgov @NancyPelosi @MaxinePWaters I'm not saying I'm an Obama fan but how was he a traitor?  Sounds like fox propaganda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ManInTheHoody @AtreiyaN7 #ShaniaTwain is just preaching to her base when saying she thinks #Trump is an honest man.  So they are a bit alike.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AMarcusYoung Dang! Fox news is dangerous. Beware of both sides propaganda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIZMAGA My goodness do you truely believe everything you just said?  I agree with the "trust the process" part but patience does not appear to be his strong point and Who would have fired them? Nixon? Don't believe the propaganda from either side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Twitter today: hard to read what people say when they are siding this great debate along party/gang colors instead of giving a decorated #Veteran and #republican a fair chance to investigate those who have influence of our #President. #Trump should want this. Let #Mueller finish!  https://t.co/lpvqk2rJQG<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CoreyLMJones It's amazing\sickening how many of us KNOW that #Mueller has not found any criminal activity and is on a witchhunt. Just drinking #Trump koolaid. It's a Republican special council for crying out loud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marjoriemkh Too much #FoxNews will lead to paranoia, anxiety, hatred, aggression and depression.  When I stopped watching I became much happier.  I hope this helps you Marjorie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pr0truth Do you have a fire extinguisher in your home, or a sprinkler system?  Why?  There likely won't be a fire but you are just being safe and smart.  Besides, #Trump is a known liar and even I now realize that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afarmer1958 @PghPublicSafety If #Trump delays the senate taking action to protect #RobertMueller then he can simply fire him any time he wants and there will be no protection.  Only an idiot would not have a fire extinguisher in house in case a fire broke out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Enarmy1 I'm ex military too and I can't stand party politics.  Politics is gang warfare. They have there own money makers, area they work in, their own colors and they look out for each other and their propaganda is likely the worst of all of it because we no longer know who to trust.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Enarmy1 I'm guessing you would like an ex military republican to take over the investigation.  This is exactly what #RobertMueller is and the likely reason he was given the job in the first place. I guess don't believe anything until you get the answer you want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jacquel25102704 #MitchMcConnell not doing anything because he doesn't see any indication #Trump might fire #RobertMueller is like a man not buying a fire extinguisher because he doesn't see any smoke yet. Prepare you #dumbass!  Of course #MitchMcConnell is not dumb, he's just got an agenda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wonkette @EvanHurst #MitchMcConell  and the #Swamp are choosing sides and we will now find out who will sell out and who will protect the American way.  Will a true leader stand up to serve the law without having #Trump and #FoxNews tear them down to suit their agenda?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fabio_vanorio Without even reading it I bet the percentage of unfavorable views for #RobertMueller closely matches the percentage of people who watch #FoxNews. When I quit watching #FoxNews channel I started living a happier life.  No joke!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alanwerickson @seanhannity @mueller @FBI The words from either a paranoid man or someone looking for attention/audience.  Us republicans were once the ones with morals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PoliticallyRYT @POTUS Republicans (myself included) once led the moral parade but now we are suckers and blind sheep following a crooked man but too many of us only find a way to see a conspiracy.  This isn't which side is right (Republicans or dems) because we don't have to choose either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FiveRights @mrod21mvp So I guess you have prepared your mind that maybe he is guilty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KAndersonMinn @seanhannity My guess is if Hannity is lying then he is hiding something so big that it can cost him his career. He's going all in. Also if he didn't pay Cohen then there isn't any attorney client privilege and whatever they have on him can be used.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity If Hannity never gave him any money then there is NO ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE!  Any favors he did for #seanhannity are not protected and can be discussed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JacobAWohl @seanhannity Lol! some people need to take off their rose-colored glasses.  Their brain is now creating fake news just to keep their Trump dream alive. Sad stuff man. I don't care what party they are in as long as they are a good and honest person! So sad that has become my dream.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OmflT When did they ever have to tag him??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 I use to see republicans as morally superior to democrats but they have (with few exceptions) sold out their moral convictions in the name of power. They are now no better than democrats.  Sad. #Ineedanewpoliticalparty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bmicheal1981 @RapSheet Sports fans lose all reasoning; the other team is "always guilty!" "Our guy was framed!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump President Trump is now writing our future school history books (and making a chapter in psychology books) so what will be learned? My assumption is he will be viewed as a prima donna and that alone will overshadow most accomplishments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkDice @realDonaldTrump As the President will be viewed in history books as a prima donna guys like this who put their thoughts out there will at times also be noticed and discussed. IMO they will be branded as what was wrong with the USA at this time. Just a racist looking for a laugh. Another ego guy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrwalsh__ I'm not even a Democrat and I'll go at this. Otto was released because NK wanted him to die here, not there. Ur stroking the prez a bit much here.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AEARepChrista @JoelCSandel This attitude makes the world a better place. Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BHam1720 It would help but don't think we wouldn't be super stressed up just 8 points.  25-0 in the 9th would be better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stump4TrumpPAC @POTUS Regardless of political party not one of us knows for sure which party is telling the truth when they speak. It's all just wishful thinking.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Doodisgirl You need to stop watching Fox news. I did and it helped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IMPERIALARMY77 @boone_sg @mitchellvii If he can't handle everything he shouldn't be president.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boone_sg @mitchellvii He's a prima donna so the answer is 'as soon as there is enough attention he will insert himself.'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BryanTNR I wonder if he too broke the league conduct policy.  He is puting the NFL in a bad light. Treat him like the players and suspend him if so.<|endoftext|>
