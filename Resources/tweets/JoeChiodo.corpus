<|startoftext|>People aren't thrilled to line up and get this vaccine. 30-40% say they don't want the first round. But we need as many people as possible to get it to have an impact on community spread. What do you say to someone who doesn't want it? @KCTV5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moderna uses standard freezer temp for vaccines we already are used to. More opportunity than Pfizer.  Pfizer: ULTRA cold freezer (that's a challenge).

<|startoftext|>Update on #Pennsylvania this AM as this race continues to be too close to call.   Pres. Trump is ahead of Biden in PA by 18,229 votes.

<|startoftext|>Also, Obese Turtle has several Twitter accounts now in case you were wondering.  https://t.co/1PixHZD3Ly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this is worth resurrecting as well following the claims that ballots are “miraculously appearing.” There is no miracle. Ballots are appearing because they can arrive on Election Day and even AFTER Election Day in some states (KS for example.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This same logic applies to the President’s statement tonight. You cannot WIN a state when votes are still being counted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“It is very disappointing. Shocking at times to hear the President say the things he did...I don’t want him to draw these conclusions when he doesn’t have the evidence to back it up.” - Rick Santorum @KCTV5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“No republican elected official will stand behind that statement...much of that statement was not factual...it was at times incendiary....and not something the President of the United States should say” - Rick Santorum (yep) on the President’s speech @KCTV5 #Elections2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WATCH:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>UPDATE from Georgia:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👇🏽👇🏽👇🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kudos to @CBSNews for cutting away to fact check the president. The amount of misinformation in just the first two minutes of that press conference is beyond dangerous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The President is about to speak on @KCTV5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From Georgia Election officials addressing voter fraud:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"magical sacks of ballots"  https://t.co/DTaplDYpQr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, this:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1. That's not how this works. 2. If the count did stop, the President would currently lose.   Pres. Trump's wish to stop counting ballots is (likely) in reference to GA and PA where his lead is narrowing.   In Arizona, on the other hand, the President is gaining ground on Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just in:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unlike Georgia, Pres. Trump is gaining ground in Arizona this AM. Currently, Biden leads by about 68,000. It continues to narrow.   AZ still has 400,000 votes to count today.  We have a live report from AZ at 7 am on KSMO and 9 am on @KCTV5   #ElectionResults2020 #ELECTION2020  https://t.co/B3xcwUJs1c<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Breaking Trump Campaign seeking recount in Wisconsin @KCTV5  https://t.co/kBRsv5KCzl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These ballots are not “new” or a “surprise” or “out of nowhere.” We knew mail in ballots would be mostly democratic. The president discouraged his base from voting by mail. Instead urging in-person voting, which is why these late votes shift toward Biden @KCTV5 #Elections2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“There is absolutely no legitimacy to the President’s tweets. He was leading before all the votes were counted. Well the 49ers were leading the Super Bowl after 3 quarters.

<|startoftext|>Check this thread of tweets from two weeks ago. This was America this weekend. And we know what comes next.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#BREAKING: The CDC now recommending no gatherings larger than 50 people for 8 weeks. That’s May 10th. @KCTV5 #coronavirus #COVID19 #CoronavirusPandemic  https://t.co/Lj6v1F4Kpx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A good reminder:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UH60Hawk Exactly. Definitely a struggle to figure out how to best warn and protect. Now wondering if saying older people are most at risk created too false of a narrative. While they may be most at risk they aren’t the only ones at risk. And that may be what most assume.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should be noted that we don’t know what pre-exciting conditions those younger people had. But nonetheless it shows there is still a lot to learn as doctors try to simultaneously treat. It also shows the importance of slowing down the spread.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Super interesting. Nice work by the Washington post. These maps show why social distancing is so important. Check it out:  https://t.co/CMpAaevjb0<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>To those who are healthy &amp; think it’s all hype: Understand you are a part of it. Whether you get sick or not. Whether you want to acknowledge it or not. Think of others before you blame the news or get upset when a game is canceled. 20-29 year olds could be the biggest spreaders.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>More from Mayor: “The City is not closing schools. We’re in communication with school districts. For now, schools &amp; districts will make separate decisions on whether to remain open or closed. The order affects only large events — which includes school events. Not schools.” @KCTV5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GramAndDun Heads up -- it's cancelled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BREAKING: 3 MORE CASES of #CORONAVIRUS in Johnson County. KDHE confirms @KCTV5 #KC #KCMO #KS #Kansas #CoronavirusPandemic #CoronaVirusUpdate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For now Mayor @QuintonLucasKC's office says schools DO NOT apply to KC's state of emergency. This means events with more than 1,000 people are cancelled, but schools are with 1000+ remain in session.  We'll ask why at his press conference shortly. This could always change. @KCTV5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>KC under state of emergency -- no events greater than 1,000 people for 21 days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not only does the 1,000 person limit apply to individual venues, but also venues that add up to 1,000. For example: Power and Light cannot exceed the number @KCTV5<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is not normal: “The White House ordered federal health officials to treat top-level coronavirus meetings as classified, an unusual step that’s restricted information &amp; hampered the U.S. government’s response to the contagion”  https://t.co/azFzSi3L6w<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Great summary of #coronavirus. Give it a read. No, you shouldn’t panic. But unlike the flu, even if you don’t get sick...it WILL likely still impact you. Travel, school, work, etc. Booking travel in the near future? Make sure it’s refundable.  https://t.co/bggAOKumgc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A company says it can bring KC’s homicide rate down by 30%. Planes would capture our every move. Similar to Google Earth..but images taken every second.

<|startoftext|>@DavidWPXI haha I'll give you that, the football season was ours. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little nervous for tonight.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DanOKennedy so awesome. Reminds me of when I had to ditch my car at that bank on grindstone for days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanOKennedy seems like the Chattanooga snowpocalypse is a bit different than the Columbia version.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AustinRatzki That's like putting chipotle in front of you as you run. It will make you run faster than you ever have. So..Good idea.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jenleereeves I was wondering how many people this was going to happen to on my feed.  Definitely felt weird typing Columbia Mall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“@HCPDNews: One subject dead is suspected shooter. No information about other victims yet.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3 dead in Columbia Mall shooting in Baltimore, MD. Horrible news. Way too many shootings in one week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samjones03 scariest place on earth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatieStukeyWOWT I agree. And we're only 25 days in! But it'd be lying to say I don't turn it up every once in a while when it comes on...<|endoftext|>
