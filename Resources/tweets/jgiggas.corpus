<|startoftext|>Should those 3 officers being charged be the end of these protests? No, actual hard laws passed by #Congress is the goal or at the local level in your town. @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @senatemajldr #protests2020 #GeorgeFloyd @CityofFresno @ABC30<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Phil_Lewis_ Can we actually show up organized, lined up, in all black and marching to one beat tomorrow? Like on some militia shit. Really scare these motherfuckers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FACTS!!! THINGS ARE CRAZY BECAUSE THEY ARE LOSING POWER. Trump is outrageous and off the cuff and radical in his own ways but I don't believe he is in the same corner as these DC career politicians. That's why he is there to disrupt the status quo. Returning to normal is ludacris<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@scottsantens @JoeBiden Neither @JoeBiden  or @realDonaldTrump  have expressed real solutions. I've been think about this pain and passion and how it will die down eventually. What comes next? Goals? Policy? Agenda? Community leaders step up @AndrewYang #YangGang #protests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FINALLEVEL #EconomicProtest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's our money they grow from. I definitely support an economic protest some time in June around the teenth. Yeah we are suffering from Covid economy. Oh well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Walkwithus #BLM #protests #dontstop #ChangeIsNeeded #GeorgeFloyd #Millennialmovement<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not sure if they are the same thing love and hate, but I know they come from passion and involve action. #love #hate #passion #police #protests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hate is a strong passion. Hate of loss, hate of separation, hating the thought of living without. Hate motivates violent action. Hate makes you stand for something. #love #hate #passion #police #protests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn't love a product of passion. When you love something you will stand for it. You are passionate about it. Through good or bad times. Love is a strong feeling, emotion, and ACTION. If you love something you act because of it everyday. #love #hate #passion #police #protests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think passion is a strong emotion. If you are passionate about something you will probably stand for it proudly and loudly #love #hate #passion #police #protests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If your local public officials don't believe in walking with protesters or speaking in front of them. VOTE THEM OUT. They are probably part of the problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump did not start anything. These issues were already here. Those in power "career politicians" already knew these things were serious issues. They had the power to address/change/stop and failed to use it. PERIOD. Vote them in. Vote them out. #protests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think what @realDonaldTrump  says is sometimes controversial, and inflammatory. He does bring out emotion in people whether you are for or against him. He has made quiet conversation front and center. These crazy times are not solely his fault but they are under his influence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think @realDonaldTrump got elected because he was not a typical politician, he may be erratic, he may very well be racist, he may be corrupt himself. But I think he scares the shit out of people in power that have had no challenge to the status quo until his presidency.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Looting is not protesting. This is tragic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UR_Ninja<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In my opinion it's a waste of time to act without a plan. Analyze, organize, mobilize. Stand for something. Walk with a purpose. If you choose to act. Don't run blindly into the night. Stay safe. #Vote. Get involved in your local politics. Actively listen. #YangGang #protests  https://t.co/Hxkyixwal5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...Don't lose site of the issue. This is across the country. #DerekChauvin was not alone in his actions, he was not alone on his patrol, he was not a alone in training, he was not alone at dinner. There are people telling him "it's ok" "you'll get through this" "we support you"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not enough to fire them, it's not enough to arrest them, is not enough to charge them, it's not enough. They have a track record of excessive force and discrimination. Purge them from your ranks. Then we can discuss a way forward #GeorgeFloyd #AhmaudAubrey #BreonnaTaylor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it's inspiring how organised they are to fight for rights we take for granted. #HongKong is modled after Western politics. We can learn from each other. We are on the same side. #humanrights #GeorgeFloyd #YangGang  https://t.co/XBntixgmVH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To sum it up...The situation will repeat itself until the fundamentals are corrected. The environment you live in effects your psyche, how you view the world and yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lol social media is dope. This is @realDonaldTrump tweet is ironic. On another note true lasting change comes from within.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please note there is a difference between an organized #protests and looting/riot don't let media numb you... also the #BostonTeaParty is a protests in history books #USA #GeorgeFloydprotest #ThisIsAmerica #community #UBI #Minneapolisprotests #AhmaudArbery #BreonnaTaylor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Government can help with funding but some times when you are low an  unknown face is hard open up to. Everything/one seems like they are against you. That's why it's important to build better communities and physical neighbors. So people do not feel excluded. Acknowledge another<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Then should be your State stepping in. The last thing on that list should be the federal government giving direct aid. You can have UBI and EBT and Health services on a local level without big government. I do not think government aid can be as personal as local support<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Then the greater community, local organizations. Organizations formed by people (activists) in your community for people in your community. To help reach people that don't have those first levels of support.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The next level should be your broader family, extended family, friends, mentors, public servants (teachers, councilor, coaches, etc) or local community.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your first level of support should be your immediate family your spouse or significant other, siblings, parents<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What I was thinking...The government (federal) should be the last thing to step in to support you when you fall.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's like I would rather have someone come to the same point without my help. Walking a completely different path. Gaining a different perspective on a topic.

<|startoftext|>On voting. There should be a way to confirm if you voted during election cycles. Besides the little "I voted stickers".

<|startoftext|>Like really think about the growth and popularity of the automobile in the USA. The influence that had on unclaimed land in the states. Before highways were built.

<|startoftext|>The division between older voters and younger voters in some cultures it's a line of respect in American culture it's a line of decent...

<|startoftext|>Silver lining...more people understand that we are connected on this planet...what happens somewhere else has an effect on you. Whether it's always this obvious or not.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>... if you aren't spending this time at home improving your condition. Then what are you doing? The same things that got you here? If you're  pretty comfortable right now then you've probably gone through this process or someone close to you has and you're benefiting from it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...you live in a community, now you may see there are lots of people out there. Some in a similar position as you. Reach out. Use this to educate get yourself into a position of control so you have time to float if the unexpected happens...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>... Needs vs wants. It's that basic is self discipline. It's making a choice everyday to improve your situation for tomorrow. I get it some times it seems impossible other factors can affect that, low paying job, kids, injury, health issues. Understand your unique condition...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>... If you find yourself in a position that your finances are being pressed right now. Take the time to get a book, go on YouTube, talk to someone that can educate you. 3 months savings for rent is the minimum you should have before buying anything you want...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...the outside should have no effect on your personal goals or how you manage your day to day self care. Waking up motivated should come from within, yeah the first week is difficult but it should be looked at as a opportunity to find new ways to be productive ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And its like at the end of this if you had to drastically change your habits or just felt really uncomfortable being at home, maybe you couldn't figure out a way to practice self care or you had trouble staying focused and productive...then you should learn a lesson from this...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't get mad when you get asked tuff questions. That's what's supposed to happen that's how you grow.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I see it as a billion dollar business getting picked up vs a sub million dollar business getting picked up. That billion dollar company going forward should have a plan for rainy days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now you do have the right to manage your business however you see fit. Bit it's unrealistic to have a billion dollar business run with the mindset of a mom and pop shop. Not saying the mom and pop should be left out to dry either. Responsible management is what I'm advocating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree with the arguments against bailing them out. When they spent excess profit selfishly without the consumer or employee in mind. These selfish/greedy business habits are a relic and need to be frowned upon in my opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There should be a task force in each of these companies to that addresses the issues and creates a plan unique to that company. Given differenent market failure scenarios on the demand and supply side both at home and abroad. My opinion on some of these airlines... Let em burn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Their contingency cannot and should not be "I hope we get bailed out" that mentality is selfish and a National Security threat. They employ hundreds of thousands of people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once businesses reach to big to fail level they should be forced to practice good business management techniques. For unforseen world events. Big government cannot and should not step in every time. These companies should be able to manage and pay their own employees<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Find them. There is opportunity to double your investment. @HiltonHotels @Twitter @BankofAmerica  As of now you can get into all three for $100. Obviously this is just the beginning, that position will get better before it gets worse speaking economically<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not because they have no money, not because they do not trust the suppliers, not because any single business is failing due too poor decision making. Understand some businesses will go under. We have learned certain business are too big to fail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Take this government direct deposit and put a piece ($100-$200) of it in your savings or invest it. Most socks are down by half at this time. This is a health emergency not a financial one. People are not in stores moving money because of government recommendations.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>To my knowledge there is no system in place to hold these app developers accountable to providing pure transparent content. Which is what social media should be. If they only want certain content visible on their app. Please let me know ahead of time. . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ex:( I just learned Chinese owned #TikTok has a censor on the search engine that prevents riots in China from appearing on the app) this app has over 500mil users. Users that won't see the unrest in this country. Users that might be able to influence the situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Social media has an influence on millions in the youngest generations as a source of news and information. The curators of this information have political and social clout.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Censorship on social media platforms positive and negative. Needs more attention. Platforms that do this secretively should be held accountable. The ability to trend and reach millions of individuals in a single day gives these platforms influence. . . and power<|endoftext|>
