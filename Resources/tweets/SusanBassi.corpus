<|startoftext|>IMO: women are the  worst when it comes to victim shaming &amp; protecting corruption.   @InteroRE agent  Pam Rodger's response when confronted with information that indicates  Patty Filice operated in @SCCgov without a broker's  license for 26 years. Pam is also under investigation.  https://t.co/rREu8NlDqM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And when the victims have money to hire pricy lawyers to advocate for them! Socioeconomically disadvantaged victims, get walked over by lawyers, judges and cops !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And as a society we need to make sure that history is not buried, but studied so we learn from it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is true, and it is the prosecutors, lawyers , cops and members of society who engage in victims shaming and blaming that allows for continued re- victimization.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very sad for the natives! This is apart of our history and is woven into the fabric of our SF memories!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This so shocked us, sadly it appears as if we have become numb to issues that harm children.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good- hope for our future since we all blew it so badly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guess the question is , if you were a new mom or dad, would you give it to your kid knowing it had been rushed by Trump orders? I would have gotten fired!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yea when we do that while investigating really bad public officials, it doesn't go well. That is what social media is for. Sometimes more rewarding !<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Didn't need much time- thank you for this post! What data did you find it from ?  I had heard at @Walmart  it is diapers! Much of this is internally reported so hard to know how bad it may be .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SantaClaraDA has been prosecuting me for 3 years for violating a local rule and recording police in a courthouse. (Same cops who broke my hand) @Jeff_Rosen  hasn't prosecuted @SCSCourt  clerk not doing the job taxpayers paid $1 million in the same time period. #RebeccaFleming  https://t.co/gblas7kY6B<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No reporter is watching America's family courts where parents have to endure the same legal proceedings as if they were @Apple @Facebook  or @Google.

<|startoftext|>According to Transparent CA , @SCSCourt CEO Rebecca Fleming  made $1.2 million  in the four years she has been top clerk of the court.

<|startoftext|>@SCCgov   DA, @Jeff_Rosen , just uses his power and influence to get it on his political enemies. This is an old  trick and until and unless groups such as @EFF @FACoalition  hold the line for transparency and accountability, it will only get worse and be too late to do anything!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree! Have been fighting those raids for years and it is standing back and laughing that makes it so much easier to endure. When the law fails to function- knowing you got the last laugh helps. Right now you are lightspeed ahead in that department- stay strong!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course they did and of course he did. Thank you for holding the line- the retaliation is now out in open. Nowhere to run and no where to hide.  You even got Desantis supporters on your side !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are several- none very good for #PattyFilice or @InteroRE  and @BHHSRealEstate  - Most brokers I have heard from are mad they did the classes, got the license and she cheated and @InteroRE knew and did nothing!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Teaching cops, lawyers &amp; reporters how to read divorce files. Don't forget what court files reveal!

<|startoftext|>There are apps that will help track where the shots are coming from. Police can use it too, but many agencies elect not to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SantaCruzDA @SantaCruzSO1 who has jurisdiction - this is outrageous!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Judges overseeing divorce cases are appointing lawyers to act for children. Minor's counsel. I have read thousands of complaints to @StateBarCA.  Unethical  lawyers ignore child abuse to collect fees. Bar did nothing to protect these children, or discipline the lawyers. Shameful  https://t.co/KYNnIU7C1G<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sliccardo on housing - HA!  When you give it all away to @Google  who then let's workers work from home, you made the bed. It is the small landlords and families who own homes you should have been worrying about. And unlicensed @InteroRE #PattyFilice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not everyone arrested and prosecuted is innocent!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, much better to accept it and be grateful. My dad died at 41, Hanging on his wall a frame of this :  Never deny growing old, it is a privilege denied to many.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOL , wonder if your willingness to say that changed in June 2020?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ethical lawyers outraged over this letter. For 30 years, controversial divorce attorneys wrote the reports of court appointed experts that favored certain  clients. Covered their tracks by cutting off the fax numbers that would reveal the scheme. @Jeff_Rosen @SantaClaraDA knew!  https://t.co/gzp0JMNVVQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And as any good reporter would ask- what is the meaning of "woof" in an audio tweet to your GF anyway! That probably deserves answering more than sending it to your supervisor where you can argue mistake - #Eratta<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhh, especially if there are weight, sight and insecurity issues in play. If not , they should laugh. No laughter, you are better off working somewhere else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeahGillisLaw- ringing the bell -  @SCCgov Guantanamo jail  sits in the middle of Silicon Valley- nobody listening. Impacts  lawyers , cops ,  food service workers and the clergy going in and out of those jails. Where is our humanity folks?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Note, the mere act of  protesting , like being a cop or a journalist, does not give blanket immunity. But arrests to chill speech is a problem. Good job @GeorgeGascon , other than those pesky SF issues with @Google , this is how a modern DA should be conducting business!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DepressionNoted That is really out of my reach ! Sadly, the injustice is rampant based on corruption in nearly every corner of local government. Find others- pay attention to local elections- use public comments and find a lawyer that believes you have a valid claim, otherwise it is a gripe!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That lawyer, Braf Baugh, took children from their mother, a Chinese immigrant. Got her sanctioned over $100,000 and took the home her father gave her. Got an order for her to not speak to her kids in Chinese.  She once said: Mothers are treated better  in China than in @SCSCourt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New politician test. So how do you feel about one of @SCCgov most controversial divorce lawyers lying about serving in Vietnam to earn more in fees out of judges who felt empathetic?  https://t.co/LcsR30VjOY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OttoLee_ Really hope you are listening- you were elected to represent the folks in Santa Clara County - you will find the stories are far different that you have seen on the news, heard from court rulings or been told by corrupt @SantaClaraDA @Jeff_Rosen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really do not know why folks are not using this time to hammer elected officials in public comment more !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what a troll looks like. Usually dirt bag lawyers or troll cops getting caught because of our investigations. I don't print anything I can't back up - Free Speech "Gloria"- going  to call out @SCCgov  corruption- taxpayer waste and human trafficking cover ups all day!  https://t.co/5dxxcG0MgT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's  in a public file, not redacted! When lawyers are dirty they leave a super dirty trail  #JasonPintar,  lawyer and LDS church member involved in 3 cases related to sexual violence and human trafficking - He was paid to harm his own clients ! I am not redacting any of that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like we got ourselves a new member in the court reform movement - and coverage! Very smart noticing that - few folks even know to check.  Outrageous ! Hope you have good criminal defense lawyers objecting to the search. Follow @FACoalition  work for reporter #BryanCarmody<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right - NO EXCUSE - anyone else would be, or should be arrested !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Transparency impacts both sides- we owe it to those accused and those who are victims. Otherwise we never find the truth and that serves nobody !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OttoLee_  DO  your job,  or join the dark corruption.   On your plate - @SCSCourt corruption - voter fraud 2018 (@mldauber @JeffRosen &amp; Cindy Hendrickson) - real estate fraud - unlicensed agent #PattyFilice @InteroRE  and human trafficking of Filipino mom #Lugaresi @LGMSPolice  https://t.co/opauWHTgYx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In 2017,  a court order issued by Judge Towery  gaged a young woman from exposing child abuse in the Los Gatos @boyscouts troop, I reached out to @SCCgov  and the local troop "owner"- nobody had a comment and nobody wanted to investigate. @SupCindyChavez gave them awards!  https://t.co/yPXLA9xKHt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chesaboudin - since I am the "1", want to  see @GeorgeGascon and  match or up the ante?   @Jeff_Rosen flatlined and folded. Too busy bunkering in place writing his whistleblower complaints and figuring out new overtime schemes  for his loyal political supporters. @thesajidakhan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When "disappointment " is the word choice, the culture is not changing at the top!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great ! BUT- still watching  SF  on  @Google funded cases. No wonder @Jeff_Rosen  didn't want to endorse you- @SantaClaraDA  arc isn't bending,  it is flatlined.    @LeahGillisLaw don't count those enhancements out in my case just yet- all rats panic when they are about to drown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Divorce attorney Sharon Roper drafted an Artificial Insemination agreement that was ultimately forged and used in a divorce case.. Now Roper is a court employee doing private judging with McManis Faulkner clients that are not being disclosed to the public!  https://t.co/C2JI65O6c1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What public corruption looks like when @SCCgov  @SantaClaraDA  play risk manager - In the great journalist Recording-the-Police in a court file room and local rule violation case,  have had 49 hearings, 6 judges and no lawful discovery! Public funds at work folks!  https://t.co/q6kzbd3eBL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks familiar !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unfreakin believable! What is it going to take to get to the tipping point!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My public defender in: Recording- the- Police case,   is a young mom. Every time she goes to the  jail to meet an indigent client, she puts herself, her children, her husband &amp; her mom at risk.  As @SantaClaraDA bunkers on Zoom.  Know her face (red) ! @LeahGillisLaw  https://t.co/XLpVERk8Xi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guess what - going to make them talk- been recording interviews for months. Until and unless the greater public sees how we have created a system to dispose of human beings long past the time they pay for a crime, we change nothing! Nobody is served by injustice or corruption.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As part of our public corruption investigation we are looking for any @SCCgov  litigant involved in a divorce or custody case and was   pressured  by their attorney to use a private judge - Especially want to hear from anyone who was told to use @SCSCourt employee Sharon Roper.  https://t.co/u9TEfO6zKk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welcome to the Retaliation Club. Should see what happened to two brothers who complained, got help from @ACLU_SoCal  and then this with @MorganHillPD  https://t.co/sZFbAmTfYl  - We have friends there with cameras - will hook him up !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You are my freakin hero ! Always record the police! People need to be very worried when the government works this hard to chill speech. Keep flying we need more canaries. We got lots of coal mines these days. Note: your children will probably grow up not trusting the police!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SupCindyChavez not that you follow your own board policies , or the law- but how is it that @Jeff_Rosen didn't face indictment for his custom and practice and bullshit whistleblower complaint against @thesajidakhan ? This is corruption in our courts and local government folks!  https://t.co/vWwNLUXVu1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Atlasa_Re Nice to see you got your license - we just exposed #Pattyfilice who has sold real estate for 26 years in CA as an @InteroRE  broker associate when she has not had a broker's license since 1994. This angers folks who did it the right way!  https://t.co/ESuBURUrAF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone paying attention ? We are in the cycle of fear- the narrative will be if reform is wanted, it will be quashed with fear!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And in family court where it is death by papercuts from the divorce lawyers. Where mothers and fathers have to become family law attorneys, criminals defense attorneys and litigators while opposing lawyers go to lunch with the judge ! Call if out  -put a name on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Starts in juvy court - persists through family court - becomes hopeless in criminal court and isn't even over in probate court. Look at the culture over the past 20 years that favored prisons over education. Not  much changing in 2020.  Until more folks listen, it won't change!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most evil and vile judge in America- nicknamed the toad, this judge separated more families, converted more property to divorce  lawyers and harmed more crime victims than any other judge = #JamesTowery. Going to keep reporting til he is indicted for rigging divorces.  https://t.co/bfMfgdhrUB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"people didn't want to get involved or make enemies". That hasn't changed much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope, you can't fix stupid , but can't get rid of vanilla, especially when we have to make Christmas cookies!  It will take education , protection of the family unit, getting rid of incompetent , complicit and corrupt public officials.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, the should as should doctors, lawyers, judges and public figures. Add nurses and teachers too. And I will kick in for reporters and publishers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That would mean- no more prescriptions, no alcohol , too. We will never get rid of it. Kids drink cold medicine and spray whip cream containers in their noses to get high!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SantaClaraDA sent @LGMSPolice @SantaClaraDA @MorganHillPD @GilroyPD to enforce mask orders in select businesses while killing rape, human trafficking and real estate fraud investigations- restaurants closed but old #PattyFilice @InteroRE still selling property w/o a license.  https://t.co/nPH29nYqYp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely drugs are a symptom of the worst crimes! But I would be asking:  Why are we not looking at the culture of cops involved in drug trafficking for the pattern to shut it down!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I started, now I dare you.  If @joebidenupdates @SenKamalaHarris are just going for a cabinet with folks of color, my kids' pediatrician is Hispanic and he would be a better choice for #HHS- for Pete Sake #HHS #FFS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I grew up in Berkeley- weed everywhere- never smoked. IMO-. Crack, Heroin and prescription drugs result in more crime. @LGMSPolice:  2019,  woman killed a 66 -year-old man hanging Christmas lights while driving on prescription meds &amp; texting - always mindful to not oversimplify.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has ignored human trafficking, public corruption in @SCCgov around the @SantaClaraDA- he did file antirust on a #VMC acquisition, but lost badly and then there is the threats on reporters who got the police records that was more than shameful - @UCBerkeley<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep and now the feds are talking legalization of weed. Oh the folks arrested and ruined on that way to that social change!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes DDA told me they were adding one DV victim &amp; one rape victim so they could have a better shot at convicting former @NBCS49ers  Ray McDonald. Guess that is kind of like a 2fer - beat one &amp; rape one then get out of jail for  free! #BlackFriday Rape Settlement Discount<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Better be paying attention folks- the voices being silenced from gender and race to ethics we will be wearing for generations!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the pattern is similar for women's issues. Was born in the 60's in SF- watched the 70s as a teen in Berkeley - moved to Silicon Valley suburbs in the 80s and now recording the police and protests!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CREWcrew  this group links documents! Backs up reporting and writes a  mean Amicus. When you are done with Trump reporting, we have some corrupt @SantaClaraDA #JeffRosen could use some help on!  @SenKamalaHarris let Rosen go after he was found to be stealing public funds!  https://t.co/RrIC29vxIo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are a million Michael Cohens in our family courts. Matched only by the DAs and Judges whose political campaigns they support. #ThatisWhy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>" I am going to be so broke I can't pay" pattern .  Silicon Valley tech executives, Hollywood celebrities and filthy lawyers become impoverished when it is time to pay child support . If they paid their kids more than their lawyers , there would be no more divorce lawyers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Until and unless this is talked about everywhere, it persists in every court in every county. The culture of our police did not happen organically, it is deeply rooted in prejudice and misguided ignorance. It persists when those harmed are silenced, and isolated. So keep talking!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How does that work when it comes to open containers and DUI cases? Public records show @SantaClaraDA currently referring law enforcement to businesses violating  COVID rules - what is this ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe a second home there too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeGascon  not just cops-  gotta look at dirty lawyers. You prosecuted  this  SF case that clearly fits patterns of human trafficking with an appearance you did it as a favor for highly paid @Google executive and his wife who wanted to be grandparents without a mom involved!  https://t.co/n3TmIDflhs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chesaboudin Looks like another  human trafficking case tied to family court- When the son of @Google executive can pay 4 lawyers , and the " abuser" is on food stamps,  time for a look at  motive,  money ,  lawyers and "victims" . Don't pull a @Jeff_Rosen  #EllenaBerg @pulcrano  https://t.co/PX1kh6bj3z<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe  lawmakers should have thought of that before they worked so hard to get  @49ers here to sit in box seats, bribe judges &amp; rig our courts ! @SCCgov @SCSCourt - @Jeff_Rosen #LarryStone more worried about seats to games than following the law! @DaveCortese @SupCindyChavez too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't we find any good old lawyers at that useless @StateBarCA  willing to do pro bono work for injunctive relief so the @49ers can't use " San Francisco" in any marketing? They corrupted @SantaClaraPD and @SCCgov - it is offensive they want their cake too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just like that family courthouse,  moved into a property they couldn't afford ! Whined about  taxes and @SCCgov gave more favors,  while the players were raping and beating women and getting away with it for greasing @Jeff_Rosen and Sinunu Towery's palms! @49ersCommunity @49ers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chesaboudin . Police NOT recognizing connection to False DV claims and divorce cases = motive for most powerful abusers to go after victims Pay - For- Prosecution.

<|startoftext|>Bloggers and citizen reporters are often not taken seriously by police or public officials. @Stogner first to report on this @sanmateoco @SMCSheriff might be paying more attention to those reporters these days!  https://t.co/75bKC6gkr8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blue Law- In CA children born to married v.  unmarried parents = treated differently in court. Kids from unwed parents have secret files,  meaning  can't view the file. Investigating if   @Google @Stanford Grandpa paid lawyers to steal a grandkid from indigent  mom? @chesaboudin  https://t.co/Z6btDhJbc3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will make you one better. It is a kids rights movie! It shows the importance of both parents and how a step parent can make things even worse.   No child should have their parental relationships obstructed by another parent , step parent, a judge or a president!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't think it is going to be solved by a new president either. Worse is lack of local reporting allows history to be revised and public corruption to run rampant because there is nothing to curate!  It isn't just Huston that has a problem these days!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't know about anyone else, but the few times have been to the store or to file documents at  court, it looks like everyone just out doing holiday shopping as usual.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@notguiltyCHI look Santa came early - CA biggest scumbag lawyer connected to #JimTowery brings unethical lawyering, divorces and stealing from women and orphans to your town!  Look at the " Accounting " cause of action!  https://t.co/U9ectTUKWi  https://t.co/eTCUJ8kQGR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And Seth would want you doing just that! You can even cry at work- let people see it so they understand - Maybe putting on a happy face isn't always what we should be showing our kids. They need to know what sorrow looks like too. Good days and bad, hope more good soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good for  @latimes reporting on this Thomas Girardi , Erika Jayne.  Jim Towery -  been racketeering client funds for decades - wrote the  book - @StateBarCA = free pass.   @GavinNewsom picked the crook to vet judges as soon as he became Gov. Shameful!  https://t.co/IvAQeEUiWV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When lawyers steal - they don't get  criminally charged! IMO- Tom Girardi  is one of the most crooked lawyers in CA! His wife,  Ericka Jayne= a real feather. Criminality goes back 20 years, as does free pass  @StateBarCA #JimTowery - crooked bastards!  https://t.co/IgdSGw3RYC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, I would read that as the opposite. Pro Choice usually means anti- death penalty for the true Berkeley rooted folks.  But that is me - and there is always the implied and inferred problem on social media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you for sharing all these stories. We love hearing you tell Seth's story and marvel at your strength to keep telling it. We will help you make sure he is not forgotten. Did you guys ever watch Patch? One of my favorites - and one of my good cop sources favorites too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Investigating fraudulent deeds filed by Monterey attorney Greg Chilton who appears to have used his bar card, and  Palma High School connections over the past 10 years to launder properties in trusts connected to Salinas Valley's farming community. @StateBarCA @SCCgov  https://t.co/1EQvzQ8Wj8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stogner  see video  on the editing of body cams. Found  auditor's report  in a backdoor. Also @EFF  and public records source  subpoenas for criminal defense lawyers shows how they bury, hide or destroy body cams. Then @SantaClaraDA  covers it up.  https://t.co/aOhutgpxeR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SCCoSheriff  assigned to the courthouse said to my demand to record him( because I don't trust cops not to tamper with  body cams )- " I don't know where you get this" Actually , from subpoenas that show  edits and deletions by key strokes! That's where.   https://t.co/kMG3DvghZf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Conducting interviews with 400 plus families  who purchased,  or sold, real estate through  an unlicensed broker who was too busy to get her license. For 26 years ! #PattyFilice @InteroRE @CA_DRE @MorganHillPD @LGMSPolice @GilroyPOA @SantaClaraDA  https://t.co/MHLa6v4NA5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SantaClaraDA  has been giving abusers on this campus a free pass for 20 years.  Former prosecutor Sinunu Towery works on  campus  and is married to a family court judge who teaches "ethics" on this campus.  #humantrafficking #realestatefraud #childabuse #SexualViolence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Granted media request in Monterey - Divorce lawyer married her client's ex, then filed DVRO against her- #DebraCrawford Mommy Dearest from Hell- swear you can't make this up. @MontereyHerald  and other local papers not making these requests and need to !  https://t.co/5sNwKiiH5J<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reform is reshuffling- Going for tear down remodel  Every police report, pleading and bad ruling that cheats the law, cheats public trust. This Mommy Don't Play that! Just promise you won't associate in when I get @Jeff_Rosen and #JudgeTowery indicted!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sliccardo  been moving to the front of the line for so long he has no idea what it means to wait in line, to follow the rules,  or to follow the law. @SantaClaraDA @BellarmineBells @SantaClaraUniv  Dr. Charles Binkley favors to cover his ass? Shameful!  @GavinNewsom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I file media requests all the time. Less than 10% granted. That should worry everyone!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always ahead of the curve from police to the issues to what we will face in the months to come. Thank you for your work on police records ( SB1421) - will look forward to reporting on the next phase of your work!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heard my first Christmas music in the grocery store last night. Probably controversial to call it Christmas music, but  won't change calling it that,  even under political pressure.

<|startoftext|>@Popehat For those who gratuitously toss First Amendment Issues around, this is one of the best blog posts I have ever seen on the topic - Love when lawyers love the First Amendment as much as journalists do! @LeahGillisLaw @josephtullylaw to name a few!  https://t.co/uBjJdIMv4P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rhetorical Questions- it is what we do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hasn't it worsened in the past 20 years? So many retired police officers reach out to me and are outraged at what they see. Are we ignorant and it was always like this?  Police reports are key to a prosecution. Cops willing to lie in them is a pattern that should be addressed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is how @SCCgov chills speech. When they don't like it, elected officials file restraining orders. Many journalists understand this, but elected officials have more police protection. This is what corruption looks like . @DaveCortese @SupCindyChavez @SantaClaraDA @Jeff_Rosen  https://t.co/ecJDpZTMWX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you think this only happens in Chicago ? Time for journalists, activists , lawyers and judges to define the culture and bust it up !  @notguiltyCHI  thoughts on your town? @SanJosePD  equally problematic with Silicon Valley money infused!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My hand , when @SCCoSheriff Deputy Gomez seized my phone, then searched it without a warrant. @SantaClaraDA has been prosecuting me for 3 years, not the cop- violation of local rule claims no recording cops breaking hands in courthouses. I was investigating corrupt @Jeff_Rosen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Contrary to opinion, judges have open divorces unless you have corrupt and complicit courts- Judge Grilli terrorized divorcing couples for years- her own divorce secreted in private judging in more ways than you can imagine- here is the docket for citizen journalists out there.  https://t.co/uOxAk1O8Lb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I didn't post them just watching the reporter get them- glad you read them though! I have some @mldauber  you could read if you want to see how a @StanfordLaw prof and @SantaClaraDA misused public funds, went on a crime spree and rigged a local election!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnDavisJDLLM We look through lots of meaningless records. As my accounting professor taught, if you are out of balance by .01 cents , you still have to balance- because you could be off not .01 but by 999,999,999.01<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All under wraps til they spring a leak- guess that makes us the leak detectors!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It should not take this long to get public records! Thank you @JasonLeopold  for the work you always do that benefits all of us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavisVanguard one of California's best publishers. He has an army of interns - assures balanced reporting and does not sell t- shirts and coffee mugs  as his business plan to fund  local reporting!  These young folks are the future of journalism @pulcrano !  https://t.co/AAadlgVUvW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good luck with that! Illegal to destroy or back date court documents too- Spoliation- how would we prove the records were destroyed!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mrodesmi Satire  is an art- I monitor how it is being done and how effective it is  - thought this one would cheer you up. Had I done it, backdrop would have been the buyout of #fourseasonslandscaping  https://t.co/6PwPSnzeu0<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Oprah as I young mom I recall hearing Oprah show us how child predators, abusers and other criminals used grooming patterns to prey on victims. We try to show the patterns  police use to inflict harm in connection to our courts. Always record the police!  https://t.co/PuT2cNlL39<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love this tweet-<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaSupremeCourt Chief Justice Tani Cantil Sakauye  got in @UCDavisLaw after watching  her mother act in pro se and lose the family home. She failed more victims of DV - saw more family homes taken &amp; human trafficking ignored in @SCSCourt than anyone!    https://t.co/tMpMca5vpj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone serious about reform needs to consider publishers such as @DavisVanguard  play a very important role in this process. As local news had dried up or been bought up by VC groups, this work is not being done. Please invest in journalism making a difference !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just think about this one case and the purpose of our legal system vs. the reality . We cover both sides and the courts, the cops and the judges are failing victims as much as they are failing to assure due process for defendants:  https://t.co/tMpMca5vpj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Judges, private lawyers &amp; cops creating a mental health/ public safety  nightmare far more dangerous than COVID - r complaints  ignored, video being destroyed, victims  threatened - Families being separated by corrupt , complicit and incompetent  judges:  https://t.co/tMpMca5vpj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someday history will refer to this as our Holocaust.  Continues because over zealous prosecutors seek to win over police unions to stay in office and  convince voters it is a matter of public safety to keep the jails full, only not with the real criminals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One public trust is lost you don't get it back, even by committee- start reporting what is really happening here, not what those in power tell you to report:  https://t.co/tMpMca5vpj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Establishing a committee does nothing to promote social justice and reforms when the @SCCoSheriff  was engaging in this conduct on Thanksgiving Eve:  https://t.co/tMpMca5vpj   Victims report Judge Ryan has been a failure and imposed irreparable  harm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Victims of domestic violence  being directed to @SCCgov  @SCSCourt   report local lawyers &amp; judges  using these cases to increase personal profits. @SCCoSheriff  not properly trained. Many officers have personal history of abuse:  https://t.co/tMpMca5vpj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SCSCourt the court publishes information directing victims of domestic violence to the courts and @SCCoSheriff  to report- this is why NO victims trust the police. Sgt. Rey should not be anywhere near a victim trying to report DV!  https://t.co/tMpMca5vpj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Public records show  @SantaClaraDA spends $5,000 to produce YouTube videos for community outreach. @Jeff_Rosen  not only wastes public funds &amp; resource's, no victims trust him or @SCCoSheriff  working in the courts to report these issues:   https://t.co/tMpMca5vpj  https://t.co/0XL2dfPVdI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SupCindyChavez said she was working on human trafficking and DV issues. She said she supported this new courthouse that cost $283 million to build. Wait til you see what that legacy really means!  https://t.co/y8OzGAvdtj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjpdchief  can't fake outrage over shooting at #Grace when there is a   pattern of only making sure @SJPD do their jobs in cases with media attention.  Remember Bambi Larson? Had a different tune about @ICE then !  https://t.co/PuT2cNlL39<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SCCoSheriff Remove Sgt. Rey from the family courthouse.  He lies in police reports , violates civil rights, follows unlawful orders and abuses victims for the benefit of highly paid lawyers.  This is NOT how to get DV victims to come forward!  https://t.co/PuT2cNlL39<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad it got better- each day you get through but especially the holidays , is a heroic moment. Want me to tell you the Thanksgiving roll story?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That drives me crazy ! So much to do, only dream of sleep- how did you do today? Imagine it was not easy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Showing what it really looks like to try to report a crime such as domestic violence or real estate fraud these days. Bad police reports and prosecutors are the greatest threat to public safety.  https://t.co/oGv0h4DfcO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thankful for the team teaching us the importance of police reports in our criminal courts.  Here is one in my great photo prosecution. What do you see? @SantaClaraDA @Jeff_Rosen  missed that report in his discovery! @LeahGillisLaw @notguiltyCHI @SCCoSheriff  https://t.co/uIHTmDgxe1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SCCoSheriff Sgt Rey in recording standoff today. This police officer writes bad  reports, protects dodgy judges and fails crime victims. He also doesn't know the law yet manages and supervises all the bailiffs assigned in the family court- he is about to get a few lessons.  https://t.co/EAr3mPNYUc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is very real- we have lost two generations to the individuals in our courts willing to harm children for their personal profit and career advancement. Gonna keep reporting on it til others do as well!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SantaClaraDA @Jeff_Rosen only sees criminals when they threaten his political office.  Millions in resources, rigging the election, free speech violations @MLDauber unleashed as she projected vitriol from her own life issues is beyond outrageous government conduct.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Do it right in front of you- leave you on  temporary restraining orders- collude at local judge and lawyer meeting- kick back appointments to those willing to call one parent crazy , abusive or unfit. It is a dance they rehearse everyday where you children pay the price to watch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks, been watching this multiple times a day in every local courthouse we have covered for 5 years. MSM &amp; local publishers  @pulcrano report what the judges and @SantaClaraDA  tell them, not what is really going on. We call that stenographic journalism- I don't do that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can't say that enough and if you are with your kids you can't understand the heartache and pain the moms who aren't are feeling right now. Today- on Thanksgiving and everyday thereafter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pulcrano @jennwadsworth  You should read my email and open up this full @LinkedIn post because Clyde and I have a bet as to why you emailed him Jenn's article published after @Jeff_Rosen held a press conference in the bogus #CCW case. @SCCoSheriff  https://t.co/PZp2o7l0JS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ALL reporters should be requesting records related to criminal prosecutions over masks and COVID orders. Emails show neighbors snitching on neighbors and competitors snitching on competitors. @GavinNewsom  in quarantine cause he didn't follow his own orders!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>..... have been amazed at the public recourses being used as prosecutors in CA are using top level staff to enforce these orders- @Apple store in @TownLG  allowed to open long before mom and pop shops based on culture created by @SantaClaraDA -so now we have work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good reporters are trained to listen to the law.  COVID has created the great mask debate, and other civil rights issues pitted against federal rights issues.

<|startoftext|>You mean responsible policing? @SCCgov  has spent 5 months allowing @SantaClaraDA  to send hundreds of police officers out on these calls, while letting serious and violent crimes persist with impunity! @LGMSPolice @SanJosePD @SCCoSheriff @SantaClaraPD  https://t.co/inPxI9BLsK<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Absolutely yes! Documentary evidence supported: Federal grant misuse - election rigging - waste of public resources- fraud on the court- collusion- corruption - Title IX fraud- Abuse of Process-  too many to name in a Tweet- with impunity provided by @pulcrano @mercnews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amoung other hypocrisies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aside from anything to do with Trump, how about all the issues ignored in Silicon Valley that include human trafficking, police misconduct, court corruption and rampant white collar crimes @JeffRosen and @SantaClaraDA  allow to be ongoing with impunity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, have had little time in 2020 to watch anything on tv, but @HandmaidsOnHulu #QueensGambit on @netflix and last drop of #TheCrown  worth the sleep loss to binge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yea well I married a farmer and if you are protecting them like you protected @Jeff_Rosen - people won’t be trusting farmers or our food supply for long. Ask @taproduce re: #StevenBassi not eating their own bagged salad products sold in @WholeFoods @costcocanada @TraderJoesList<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Better to eat double stuff alone than regular with a dud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hence the “esq” in your profile<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More dangerous than COVID or who will be the next President !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GackleReport  @mrodesmi found this video of @SantaClaraDA  talking about trying to figure out what to do if someone is stabbed. Posted on LinkedIn. Given all the money  they are paid and time they have had since @Jeff_Rosen was elected , shouldn’t they have figured that out?  https://t.co/nlFaFbDlpc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>....... a question NO reporter ever asks:  How do they get along with their wife, mother, sisters, sons and daughters? I read divorce files. Bad cops have a long history of abusive relationships. No HR or screening ever evaluates these issues but they impact cop culture most.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My questions would be: 1. History of transparency (public records performance)? 2. What is the culture they came from? 3.  What culture would they create? 4. What is their record on disciplining bad cops? 5. What would they do for ongoing mental health evaluations? And......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't eat bagged salad from @taproduce  could be more deadly than COVID experts in the Salinas Valley say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is not the numbers- it is the training, management and prosecution. @SantaClaraDA sits in the most important economy in the world and the only crimes the duly elected @Jeff_Rosen  prosecutes are petty crimes as the real criminals operate with impunity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Them too huh? @GackleReport<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope, the next big idea won't come from Silicon Valley, but the next big story will - #TooBig not to investigate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One Thanksgiving my brother-in-law who ran all of @taproduce farming operations- said  he wouldn't eat  T&amp;A bagged salad based on the company's protocols and  risk bagged salad posed to sicken millions #Ecoli - ponder that before you reach for the bag this year.  https://t.co/aRxgAeQkcn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnfseery happy to find you- Old Irish investigative reporter here about to break a story on an organic seed counterfeiting ring @taproduce benefited from to increase profits on organic and bagged salad products- might be up your alley.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CCOForganic Still certifying #MissionRanches or @taproduce?   We can help with that. There are some things a federal lawsuit alleges that organic consumers are going to want to talk about!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guess ag lawyers double as marketing agents too- let's see the spin he can do on the new federal lawsuit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait til you read the new federal lawsuit about what he was doing before he died, might make you not so sad!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Federal lawsuit- not the pretty picture @taproduce  would want it to be for the next photo op !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Federal lawsuit says that public position on sustainability and organic- not so much as Duttle would have the media think!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait for it- about to me more than voluntary!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not the only problem @taproduce has. #SteveBassi ,  head of @TAProduce farming operation,  told me one Thanksgiving he would never eat T &amp;A bagged salad because the company protocols put more people at risk from getting sick, or killed.  #EColi #Salmonella #Listeria #CarmenPonce<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You are going to want to see what is getting filed in federal court soon- then yes, I will have comment and more evidence than you could ever stand to read!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like @propublica  is going to need information from investigative reporters who actually know something about #SalinasValley #Yuma @ACLUaz @taproduce @DoleSunshine @earthboundfarm and what labor contractors do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't be distracted by @pulcrano being @Jeff_Rosen  puppet on the CCW case involving the @SCCoSheriff . #JeffRosen #JohnChase don't know how to prosecute public corruption when it hits them in the face- so they go to #Towery and #EricGeffon to fake their way to the next election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And you may be interested in  #SalinasValley  human trafficking through labor contractors concealed by @taproduce that #JudgeTowery also buried during the same time that @Jeff_Rosen  covered  up for his political  donors. #HogeFenton #FentonKeller #ChiltonHouse #PattyFilice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Want my list ? Judge Towery in active human trafficking's case  @Jeff_Rosen  looked away on and @LGMSPolice  ignored so the feds have stepped in. Hundreds, if not thousands of children in our family courts that are secreted by judges as @pulcrano belongs to their social clubs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice move on the copyright catch. @JohnGrisham should make an intro interesting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NO public official should have " friends in the media" . In a #FreePress it is not our job to be friends with folks we are to investigate and hold accountable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, this is the day we found out top performer #PattyFilice from the @InteroRE office in @MorganHillPD  hasn't had a valid broker's license for 26 years at Intero pimped her out as a top commission and sales person in @SCCgov  https://t.co/s5rHsiZksu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More than that !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your son's murder was never about race- it is about mental health,  gun violence and maybe hate. In 2020 those issues are brewing in a manner we better start paying attention to- very dangerous for all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FredJoh57935135 Not letting me reshare, of course the top real estate owners in Silicon Valley are now the tech companies that weren't even hear 30 years ago- just about as long as #PattyFilice hasn't had her license but selling for @InteroRE  as if she did!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FredJoh57935135 Thanks for the find Fred! Maybe that is why unlicensed @InteroRE  agent #PattyFilice tried to Facetime me at 5:34am on Friday ! Think she needed help with her YouTube videos? Or maybe she wanted to be a source to expose that private judge scam!  https://t.co/zNPKjb3VoH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StateBarCA records show lawyers steal millions from clients and others, yet NO lawyers prosecuted for that crime.  @GilroyCali #PattyFilice stole millions in real estate as unlicensed broker for @Intero and @Jeff_Rosen gave her a free pass @sanjoserotary  connection &amp;  #Towery<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why the public distrusts prosecutors &amp; publishers.  COVID, mental health issues, untested SART kits, rampant public corruption, protests &amp; police misconduct  on our streets- @SantaClaraDA @Jeff_Rosen  presses political prosecutions  @pulcrano @nbcbayarea think folks care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Collaborative Media Project On a DUI case- including @ACDefenders @cocodefender Victim Advocates @berkeleypolice  @MADDOnline @UCBerkeley students on this one. Thank you @ContraCostaDA and @OfficerByron  for the records! @WorkMumOnTheRun @mrodesmi @GackleReport almost ready!  https://t.co/eAfYOAVkLD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarwinBondGraha every reporter should have Gov. Code 6253 ( a) tattooed on their forehead. Most important fight we have. Thought you might like to the fight in @SCCgov @SantaClaraDA - and what it takes to investigate a DA protecting bad cops.   https://t.co/x3lBTKcpQ1  https://t.co/JVu2BwyrHb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I LOVE THIS MAN!  Secondary employment records and they really don't want us to have them - @SJPD @SantaClaraPD @LGMSPolice and @SCCoSheriff - Want to do a combo demand for access to inspect ? The law does not permit them to charge for access to inspect records, only copies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hear it every day- not just CPS- judges are knowingly violating the law to benefit  "visitation centers ", custody evaluators, drug testing, and lawyers.  I know the names of the kids: Nick, Tanya, Sara, Alexandra, Tommy, Emilee, Chris, Jenny , Ian, Joey , Sydney, Natasha..++++++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happens in family court every day - in every community - and folks have no idea it is going on just down the street and far more than $8 million in public funds! " Cost of Deliberate Cruelty" that is harbored in the minds and souls of children subjected to it over a divorce.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Public records:  @Jeff_Rosen spent 2020 calling on Silicon Valley law enforcement to go after businesses not enforcing mask orders- So far counted over 300 referrals done by top prosecutors making $350K plus a year.  Social media shaming more effective than DAs &amp; cops these days.  https://t.co/YBw9yiTcZ7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@radleybalko JBF at the #FourSeasons ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our legal system reality. Thank you @radleybalko for keeping up the discussion. Name the judges- it is my mission to inspire every reporter to name the judge- put each and every judge name on the story- and the death.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When family court stories slip into the conscience of the press- I sleep better. Have seen parents pay millions for drug testing, supervised visitation, and other BS charges. Family court: where lawyers incite conflict - judges ignore the law and humanity goes to die.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brilliant Wordsmithing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe a wife motivated order- keeping him at home for the night so no repeats. #RubyRippeyGibney #AlexTourke  https://t.co/Boe7WLgos5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reporting on police means getting the contracts for cops assigned to the courts. GET the RECORDS! In @SCCgov the @SCCoSheriff can remove a bailiff assigned to a courtroom, but they have to notify the judge- how do you think that is going?  https://t.co/I6S2Ck6FEh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My first editor taught me that magazine layout needed to be done to allow reader's eyes to rest.  So to give your eyes a rest from COVID, elections and whatever, meet my favorite map post in 2020 !  https://t.co/ke5LqWvRA8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Retaliation:  Cops , lawyers and judges- they all the masters. @CaSupremeCourt  has issued new direction for investigating judge complaints. If the presiding judge has friendships that prevent fair investigations and provide for retaliation- oh wait.   https://t.co/vXxKXHtoms<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't pin any of my reporting on a political position , I don't have one like other publishers and reporters do. Also consider the trickledown of the orders- @Jeff_Rosen  using to selectively enforce at a local level. Got more records!  https://t.co/fFxUurWPDr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does he plan to follow it  -or will he keep heading out to party with lobbyists?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Public records show @SantaClaraDA #SeanWebby #DDAKInerci @Jeff_Rosen just writing the movie- sharing press releases and editing victim statements for desired  legal &amp; political outcomes. @mercnews reporter sent @mldauber press release- Not legal or journalism ethics folks!  https://t.co/laPbpAg5kL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FredJoh57935135 @CatsCommentary  yes, this is one of the greatest police coverups and @SantaClaraDA  Victim Services violated all laws and procedures to move the victim to FL so she could not testify against them. #KaseyHalcon #SaherStephan #NidaRehman did it.  https://t.co/sALzYT6rR4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First time  @GavinNewsom  ran-  he cheated on his wife with campaign manager's wife. Then did private judging and concealed the divorce which was not publicly posted in SF as CRC 2.834 requires. Of course he doesn't follow his own COVID orders! What were you expecting?  https://t.co/RfrWUuBgUz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom yes, you lost your moral authority- not for a parent or loved one in a small group but for a lobbyist. Are you kidding? It is not a mistake. And it is not the first time.  https://t.co/8RoL56NC13<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeahGillisLaw you rocked it ! Thank you @PublicDefenders are Superheroes for journalists and publishers investigating prosecutors. Do you think @Jeff_Rosen knows the party is over and he isn't invited to the next one?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One year ago this month I sat with the @berkeleyside  team at the @spj_tweets awards in San Francisco. These folks show why local reporting matters.  Thanks for all you do - it matters. @mrodesmi @GackleReport @OfficerByron @berkeleyside  https://t.co/8r3y5NrbHw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now for the other side. We will order the file , review the police reports and look at the pretrial and motions inlimine - #SethSmiths mother deserves to know the truth about what happened to her son. No matter where the truth lies! @mrodesmi @berkeleyside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>" A reporter was in the courtroom" - for the mother of this young @UCBerkeley student that matters !!!! Great job @berkeleyside @berkeleypolice @OfficerByron  @GackleReport  this is how it is supposed to work!  #ReportLocal #sethsmith<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Press passes are not required to record in public  or to provide information to the public - which is the job of a free press. If you do it. You are it!  https://t.co/J90TofeHXz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good for you - transparency- information  and accountability!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WorkMumOnTheRun- meet @mrodesmi  @GackleReport -  would like to work with you on a project related to the article that popped up today- Email:  GilroyBassi@Gmail.com . Will introduce you to Autumn Steele's mom and the police video she had to see.  https://t.co/ktuHgDfmd7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good, we are watching and disappointed is was dropped in March 2020 with little comment. Prosecutors are ground zero for police misconduct issues- look at the culture and it may open old cases in @AlamedaCounty  as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Investigating  his divorce &amp; private judge - not disclosed. One hat as a journalist, another as a mom. He has a hard hump to get over after cheating on his wife with his campaign manager's wife. Sometimes an apology doesn't address a pattern that keeps repeating. @GavinNewsom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With pictures if it helps !  https://t.co/laZ87gL9D3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Before you sip your @Starbucks,  check your @Twitter feed, call an @Uber, post on @LinkedIn @Facebook @Instagram, read the @PostOpinions  and @NYTimesAtWar on your @Apple iPhone -  read this five times and just ponder for a moment what this means.    https://t.co/D8hg45mGN3  https://t.co/y1Mbe5KUDp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny you two liked  at the same time, I actually thought about both of you when I wrote it. Adding: @GavinNewsom will also never know what it is like to have a 25 year old woman stab his son 25 times only to see  @Jeff_Rosen let her go. #SydneyWhalen #KaseyHalcon @SantaClaraDA  https://t.co/z1R7A0TOKZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>COVID emails are the new public records treasures= Everyone had to use email and had no idea what was going on. These are gold- thank you for your work and to @BuzzFeed for keeping you doing it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every complicit prosecutor, and every sloppy criminal defense lawyer should think about this. As far as @GavinNewsom  goes- he slipped through the net and into money and power that will mean he will never have to answer that question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EstherWojcicki  time to harness the teacher and the journalist in you - this is just another story buried in the social media noise. Time to start unburying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOW- Know the #Arpaio retaliation lawsuit well. No change here. Think she knows what a Pitchess Motion is? #GypsyCop brought me here- Hummmmm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And educate - educate - educate - and then cut the DA's budget and Kasey Halcon who harms more victims than she protects. Fairness means for defendants and victims. Under @Jeff_Rosen management they are often one in the same!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Adore the @DefendCSRA who are activists too- and not just the jails - the prosecutors who play dirty to put people there- that is what has to change first -repurpose for white collar crime - it does more public harm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeGascon- don't slip up . Progressive means  DAs willing to repurpose resources to go after white collar crimes that do more public harm.  @Jeff_Rosen  supported Lacey.  Spent 10 years worrying about getting elected more than public protection and fairness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Case in point #BrockTurner and the recall of Judge Persky- aside from the rigging @Jeff_Rosen and @mldauber , Hendrickson landed wrongly on the bench - if she does in criminal court what she does in DV court- will be case study of why prosecutors should not be judges!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, it is a mandate- repurpose resources to get the real criminals- #whitecollar crime- won't find lots of folks of color in that lot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mldauber did you call in today to hear them talk about your criminality and protecting @Jeff_Rosen  to rig the 2018 recall?  You haven't said sorry yet- we are waiting - you sure sucked down public resources from your private university. @StanfordLaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The incredible career of DDA Hernandez of @SantaClaraDA could not figure out Kathey Fyke's private judge order was VOID - now she is on the Nazi  Mask force @Jeff_Rosen  is using public funds to enforce during COVID as the real criminals run free !  https://t.co/Q4sr1cRzxb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My God this is the most accurate statement on @Twitter!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeahGillisLaw (red) - professional - passionate - calls out prosecutorial misconduct - Quote from today's hearing re: @Jeff_Rosen and @SantaClaraDA "Ms. Bassi was, is and always will be a pain in their side" . Go back to WI  #jeff.  We were here first! @thesajidakhan  https://t.co/zv7rh0pgsR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First County Counsel to deflect lawsuits- #Finkelstein and police misconduct. Then when Whistleblower lawsuit progressed she went to the DOJ and buried it. She has been supporting the @Jeff_Rosen regime on the climb to higher office.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also @SCCgov has over $2 billion invested in @Walmart and offshore accounts - as @AnnMRavel deflects with "DARK MONEY " claims in other areas. They let Walmart open in COVID, but not mom and pop businesses. Those @Jeff_Rosen wanted to prosecute!  https://t.co/MGbY5dsU3A<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How about a whistleblower lawsuit where @SCCgov and @AnnRavel overbilled for ghost children in foster care. Ravel went to DOJ and buried the lawsuit- we have the records. Meaning billing for kids who don't exist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOL  - would miss your humor if you went to bed early. Speaking of sociopaths-  got more public records today from @LGMSPolice . @pulcrano  didn't want to mention- seems @Jeff_Rosen so busy with @Mldauber he missed a real human trafficking case  in @TownLG - now feds are asking  https://t.co/P5ESPpBu02<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Back to local reporting: Corrupt divorce lawyers #NicoleFord and government lawyers - #SinunuTowery  so much public money- so little results- so much money for Ford and others like her who did little to protect. Ruined lives, protected NOBODY - made lots of money! @SantaClaraDA  https://t.co/sN9iNgc6gq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is right - by the letter of the law- we watch to see if that law is followed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Summer 2020: Murder,  human trafficking, child abuse, real estate fraud &amp; public corruption cases brought to the attention of @LGMSPolice -  investigated COVID snitch referrals from @SantaClaraDA instead! Really need to think how police  and DA resources are being used - @TownLG  https://t.co/7Gh6PqXDXt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If they held back discovery in any criminal case as they have done here- @SCCgov should be cutting the DA's budget in half. firing most of @Jeff_Rosen government lawyers who are on the take and not following the law to protect a corrupt boss running out of political runway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I probably have- #KeithDolnick #JudgeMoss #DavidWeinberg #SheliaSonenshine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOL - so the corrupt court clerk in @SCCgov  running @SCSCourt  could be held in contempt for not doing her job when it comes to appeals-  evil step sister of @OCSuperiorCourt where #Yamasaki took the corruption train in 2017 - Jail couldn't happen to a better couple.  https://t.co/MEL44BuZ5F<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually only my public defender badass @LeahGillisLaw  admitting- @SantaClaraDA having a tough time choking that down! @Jeff_Rosen has less than a month to admit he never prosecuted a local rule violation- because Rosen can't make up the law and enforce it too- can't fix stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>" SHALL" v.  " MAY" - Thanks to the lawyers making the law more fun and easy for the general public to follow and understand. Today @Popehat pointed out lawyers are the gatekeepers of civility - even when opposing Giuliani or Jones Day!  Canon 3D2 folks! @ScottHech @notguiltyCHI  https://t.co/s2eyjtAydE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeff_Rosen - your box on political prosecutions is getting smaller-  hope you can come up with ONE time when you filed a charge to prosecute  someone for violating a local RULE- YOU ARE F'ed cause we know you DON'T HAVE IT! HA love spanking a dirty DA ! @LeahGillisLaw rocks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OOOO DA in @SantaClaraDA does not have the tech ability to determine the distinguish between violating a local rule and a local order- THAT IS BECAUSE THEY NEVER CHARGED A VIOLATION OF A LOCAL RULE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Partially granted the Murgia motion- DA prosecutions for violating a local rule- deny request for communications with @SCCoSheriff - protecting that blue line- Geffon not watching the news or listening to the streets in #BlacklivesMatters era<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Geffon now noting @SantaClaraDA allowed Dauber to commit crimes with impunity so appears leaning in favor of the motion- but back to drinking the Kool-aid on the DA's pleading.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now Geffon on protection mode- bowing down to @JeffRosen discretion ( which is crap and corrupt ) .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now @LeahGillisLaw argued Dauber the criminal - and @Jeff_Rosen  protecting Rosen for political purposes. " Ms. Bassi has been, is and will always be a pain in their side"  Yep @Jeff_Rosen  you can bank on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SantaClaraDA  can't seem to recall the recording- now she is arguing @Mldauber not a criminal  even though she violated the same order 100 times more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now taking up the issue that a law enforcement officer was calling the DA to say " Ms. Bassi is here being Ms. Bassi" !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Little tap dancing on Geffon's part he does not want it in the record that I was investigating the DA for public corruption.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now taking up the issue of the @SantaClaraDA  lying in a supplemental reply- Leah Gillis is bringing it up - was Ms. Bassi known to the DA at the time of the charges.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Judge Geffon first taking up the issue of @Google  not properly complying with a subpoena.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going to live Tweet Judge Geffon's hearing in @SCCgov where the issue is prosecutorial misconduct on the part of @JeffRosen and the @SantaClara DA's office. Judge was late in calling the case - we are up first<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SCCBarAssn @VictimBar @OCBA_FL @maricopa_bar @Cal_DAA @SDCAnews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How @StateBarCA fails to protect the public: Attorneys are increasingly getting appointed to as judges- when they fail to follow the law and pervert the administration of justice, the Bar is giving confidential discipline and they go on and harm to the public is secreted.  https://t.co/rRkwqSIN81<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GackleReport @LeahGillisLaw @thesajidakhan @notguiltyCHI @TracieOlsonPD @DavisVanguard  Prosecutorial misconduct ( hiding evidence and lying to the court) is a big deal- if @Jeff_Rosen  will do it in a case with a journalist, he will do it to anyone.  https://t.co/rzaf0TjDZD<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thanks for looking out. This is very similar to how the @Jeff_Rosen @SantaClaraDA @SanJosePD @SCCgov gave the 49ers a free pass when they came to down- Mr. Rosen not fond of our investigation on that as it snaps up his buddies - #JimTowery #KarynSinunuTowery @sjpdchief @sliccardo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ALL INTERNS- REPORTERS - CITIZEN WATCHDOGS - Make #FOIA and public records requests to see what city and county agencies are spending public funds on to enforce during COVID- Murder?

<|startoftext|>How DAs create fake news &amp; stay in office. @Jeff_Rosen has allowed thousands of child abusers who  are white, wealthy or supporters of his campaign.

<|startoftext|>Maybe splain it to the kid- Rebel Republican injured by the cops while reporting on the 2020 protests! Never apologize for the fight Irish blood puts in ya!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>School districts are complicit, even corrupt when it comes to custody and restraining orders in family law cases. Teachers have no idea what children are facing when parents are involved in a divorce. There are lots of folks in @OCSuperiorCourt joining to reform family court.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The vexatious litigant statue is abused by many lawyers as a bad faith litigation tactic so often, it is like false DV claims - judges ultimately issue rulings for favored lawyers and the DA rarely enforces court orders in DV or family law cases.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Call me a romantic , still believe in marriage, and that folks have a right to do it or not when they have kids. Mostly believe the government has no right to treat married parents differently than unmarried, but that old blue law on CA books says otherwise.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Funny Dorsay thought @JeffRosen was an " honest " guy - sounds like real estate fraud and @InteroRE #PattyFilice betting Dorsay doesn't have a license either! #DrAnnis  https://t.co/RV6JhaP7oO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No it is unlicensed agents selling home off in divorce cases  while the local @SantaClaraDA looks away and is married to a family court judge. #JeffRosen  https://t.co/RV6JhaP7oO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh look @InteroRE  the public is entitled to licensed real estate agents , which #PattyFilice is not. Posted this video - found out people are interested in real estate fraud.  https://t.co/RV6JhaP7oO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can say that in 2020 @Jeff_Rosen @SantaClaraDA  dropped several white collar real estate investigations and prosecutions with an eye to protecting #JudgeTowery @sliccardo this is what corruption looks like!  https://t.co/gvA4v6sGB2 and Carasco is a crisis actor in this one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And then there are all the ones the @SantaClaraDA and @Jeff_Rosen let get away- #RayMcDonald- all because Sinunu Towery liked her 49er games!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In 2012 I knew one person who had been arrested, prosecuted and to jail.     In 2020 I record police, investigate the DA &amp;  judges who don’t follow the law- this thread explains why ..going to take a lot of days- hang with me to find the story that moves you to do something.  https://t.co/ER9nMNwk9l<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have seen it progress- and have interviewed the women who went to jail as their former husbands committed actual crimes- this is a culture created by police and corrupt DAs ( @JeffRosen)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the police, DA and judges won't believe them anyway- no matter how many folks protest with pink pussy hats on .  Three years after #Metoo and it is worse for every mom who contacts me EVERYDAY!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notguiltyCHI - Auditing my way to Chi town soon! IOWA waiting too - wait til you see what we are going to do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bad Apples need transparency and accountability. Thanks for the oversight !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reporters and activists can't be everywhere- so important for everyone to record the police- it matters! We are working on a project in Berkeley getting public records, video and following the stats and the culture. Community policing- police aides offer opportunity to educate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are watching and collaborative report- remember it is a culture and if ever it can be changed #Berkeley is the place to do it!  https://t.co/lwLVSNjQAv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Old print publisher for community magazine- saw people advertise to keep the information local. Bigger news @mercnews and @metronewspaper not doing the job that needs to be done- look for publishers with a different philosophy - then keep them in business.  It matters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really interested in your work on this- we are investigating it in Berkeley going to use a few case studies- looking at a murder- DUI - and others!  https://t.co/lwLVSNjQAv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And never dumb if you say you don't know and are open to the answer!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And think: Arnold Schwarzenegger- his divorce with @mariashriver fully open to the public- the child support issues with the maid- and paternity - all secret- old blue law- shames unmarried moms - unmarried dads with no money don't do well either- #MichaelLazarin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Am glad you asked- @pulcrano never married the mother of his children- his family court case is secreted - we don't even know what lawyer he hired or if he hid money for child support. Married couples- all open  files and proceedings. Old blue law - slut shames moms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great article and the legal pleading included for the legal fans out there- think about it as applied !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When COVID hit - my kids said I had been training for this all my life- former surgical trainer - my kids heard " wash your hands" a million times a day. Masks in surgery are there to protect everyone- Not that hard folks - just do it - maybe you won't get COVID, or a cold!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FACoalition @StephenJamesUS  @thomas_peele @NateGartrell @EFF @propublica @ACLU_NorCal @ACLU_SoCal   Federal - state and local courts - then access to video in every court - these are not areas where access should ever be blocked. #FreePress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a non-profit making a difference- give up your @Starbucks  one day a week- and put your money where it matters. Here - @EFF  @FACoalition<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have heard me say it- this happens because there is local reporting , first Amendment auditing on social media and national news focusing in and this is what a free press looks like to make the changes every community needs. #ReportLocal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BubbleSanJose In a divorce: No jury - biased judges- no oversight- no following the law - you lose your house - your kids and what used to take 1 year now takes 10- the judges allow it- corrupt DA's ( Rosen ) are married to those judges!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, that is perspective of most and completely false- since the valley exploded- men in powerful positions getting the advantage- mothers losing homes, custody of their kids and things you can not imagine. Of course no media reports on it .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You have NO Idea !   When I  started investigating family courts, $150K to get a divorce seemed shocking. This is taken from a 2013 pleading from an attorney working for McManis Faulkner. This was two years into a case- judges are letting this happen to children and families.  https://t.co/ZOJeuHpv5t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have said it before, for such a small Bay Area community how did it get this bad?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do often think of the women who remain silent and believe they are just as responsible. I also think of the women who try to speak up and have to say can't blame anyone too afraid or stupid to speak up. So far it hasn't been working out for those smart enough to call it out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too- you have Twitter- LinkedIn and so many others - FB IMO has jumped the shark and taken too much power and privacy from our lives!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or old men clinging to a world that passed them by decades ago, with a few women tossed in for arm candy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We want to know about your son- have been investigating CA criminal and family courts for five years- happy to take a look- it is a cruel system loaded with misconduct and the harm will last long after he is out ! We have a big group of moms to connect who may help too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They never consider the rehabilitation - or life after time served is up. Thank you for sharing !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very good point. Never even considered that. Maybe slip us the names of the professors and we will point it out. @StanfordLaw @BerkeleyLaw @HastingsLJ @HarvardLawProf @YPractitioners<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn't 40 enough you should be checking your husband's judgement in friend choice ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you for sharing- it is astounding we are thinking about the holidays as if nothing else matters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very sorry - we often forget how important pets are in our lives- especially during COVID lock- ins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are going to have to get done what we didn't for the last 30 years! Education - Transparency and Accountability and it must include police- DAs and judges!  https://t.co/X4T7TKj2Xk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When will your administration start focusing on family courts as much as masks? More families unlawfully separated in CA Family Courts than at the border!  #DomesticViolence #privatejudges #Judgecrime #excessivefees #PublicCorruption  #judgemisconduct #CPS #Custody<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For five years we have been following these cases in @SCCgov - less than 5%   have been prosecuted especially if they are related to family court cases where private lawyers are making lots of money to suppress the crime. Good job making this a priority!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>His greatest support came from his son who always remembered his father, If I recall, @chesaboudin was actually in NYC visiting his father when he learned he had been elected as San Francisco's District Attorney.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Krasner4DA @GeorgeGascon  won in LA but let us not revise history - he oversaw the police who broke down the door of a journalist and saw a culture that has not changed much for the past 20 years!  https://t.co/X4T7TKj2Xk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't forget - selective closures of some businesses while others and the courts are open matters more than who will be President next year.  Judges acting like this and calling 911 in the pandemic need to be removed.  https://t.co/X4T7TKj2Xk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Focus on reporting here! There is plenty of it  https://t.co/X4T7TKj2Xk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ThinBlueLIne between judges, prosecutors and police needs our attention the most!  https://t.co/2rqLERpZ74<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is creeping in everywhere- even on our security cameras- we all need to be mindful of that- and appreciative @EFF is looking ahead!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be fair in an assessment that connects to politics, remember this is a judge who was appointed by the very popular Governor Cuomo @ChrisCuomo @GovChristie.  Not political- it is about entitlement and abuse of power when dealing with police and judges.  https://t.co/2rqLERpZ74<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And you got home- it is privilege we don't even see - spousal, attorney, reporter, so many kinds unless you are poor and engage in a low - speed chase. Thank you for noticing !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now back to our regular reporting on the courts, the police and judges who get arrested, but not prosecuted.    https://t.co/ktwZexz309 we are investigating  the calls for defunding and those for improving education of law enforcement. @ucbsoj @berkeleypolice @BPDAlerts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very sorry, so often the stigma of suicide is unleashed on those who are harmed the most.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you are in a divorce, if you do not settle nicely and move on, you don't end up keeping any of it to yourself. You pay a lawyer to exploits it - and in this case- they are both doing that- for regular folks it is more one sided and follows the one with the money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dos por el tango y el divorcio es un proceso judicial equitativo. Es decir, dividir y seguir adelante. Los problemas actuales son sobre ambos y sobre su carácter. Elegir un juez privado para conceder a ambos su carácter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What was the law they were trying to pass? How can they force vaccinations when there isn't one?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>importante entender el pasado para no repetir la historia. Patrón y práctica como decimos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Private judging: Have been investigating for 5 years- it is the secret shifting of cases from public court to private lawyers - and retired judges who are paid big bucks and who bring all their bias to the table in their rulings, which benefit certain lawyers and their clients.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>71 percent is higher than most- the @BPDAlerts issue show how that really works when the DA and Judges are involved in calling the shots on police misconduct.  https://t.co/vswycoCOeC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you are a celebrity  and you are in a divorce - even if you use a highly paid private judge, you are like everyone else- there are no " closed doors" . California Rules of Court 2.834 - open proceedings- not gossip magazine stuff!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavisVanguard knocking it out of the park by having these young reporters report on court cases- what the reporter needs here:  1. Facts on pro pers winning in court  2. Why it matters that he waived a jury trial-   Ask anyone who had to represent themselves in family courts!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, women are their own worst enemy- we also are  led to form opinions by good marketing for material and superficial items- anyone unwilling to learn or listen, probably not worth the breath - man or woman- not a gender issue- and I don't engage with those who want it to be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Usually all are appointed first - then run unopposed so are elected- Towery- Grilli - McCracken- Scott- etc etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the ultimate form of engagement! Haven't see the show , but will now- thank you @therealKripke - loved your tweet and attentiveness to your brand!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Am I the only one struck by the fact that it doesn't come down to Biden or Trump, but Georgia ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every morning I wake up and hope local reporters, activists and human beings will be discussing something other than Trump and Biden. I am going back to sleep. Will hope again tomorrow- please remember there are things in your community that need more attention now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He is adorable - and stylish too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"women like you" that mere statement shows how outright ignorant you are - it is not a gender issue. People who make it one are called @mldauber  these are women who hate men for being men, even when they have sons. It is not a gender issue- it is a human being issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look - it was out there from the making of Mr. and Mrs. Smith- it speaks to her morality which is going to impact what she now does in a divorce, which she is grabbing media attention for now- so we are going to cover that- even if it hurts your feelings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ummmm- just now when you said it - LOL !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kellydudzikWGRZ Hope you are staying on this story  https://t.co/gRuw5v4OTl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is by far the best publisher in the country- he is training the next generation of lawyer and judges- he is training the army our Democracy needs to cover our courts in the months and years to come as reform and funding issues are addressed. @DavisVanguard @TracieOlsonPD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Music  - walk and change what you are doing- go for a drive- eat something you love and remember happy times- Sadness never goes away, but it does get more bearable so the happy times are easier to remember! Call the lady I suggested! You have purpose on this journey!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since @pulcrano was arrested  in 2010 he has given favorable reporting to @Jeff_Rosen - refuses  factual reporting when it comes to covering Rosen's office. He had the emails- did nothing, as with a human trafficking and real estate fraud case- protects Rosen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or-  Grandmas pick up a camera and record local politicians, judges &amp; DA's. You don't get the grandma vote @sliccardo just because you put a photo of a mask up and look the other way as you and your thugs are evicting grandmas from their houses. #PattyFilice @InteroRE  https://t.co/0vqccmqJSz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BubbleSanJose Or this one about our local courts and corrupt DA @Jeff_Rosen ?  https://t.co/x3lBTJUOrr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BubbleSanJose Have you seen this on the Dauber - Rosen - Hendrickson issue?  https://t.co/0VXHHcsfri<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine that everyday !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, Everyone has a job to do.  Justice only happens when victims and defendants are treated fairly- when prosecutors don't cheat and public defenders don't half step. The public and press have to have access, so  in denying the video to that courtroom, justice is being evaded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ending mass incarceration has to include addressing white collar crimes and criminals who have acted with impunity in this system for decades.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AnnMRavel husband - cousin  @AdamSchiff -prosecutor- impeachment hearings.  @AnnMRavel  works for @MapLight  @AnnRavel lawyer on team defending Judge Persky #2018 election.  Showed @AnnMRavel  evidence  @Jeff_Rosen @mldauber rigged recall. #Ravel took #Rosen endorsement #2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shouldn't @MapLight  investigate the 2018 election-CCW case-  re-election of @Jeff_Rosen and @mldauber having opponent's @Twitter  accounts taken out by #KenDauber who works for @Google? better than paying @AnnMRavel - she lost senate race- even with Rosen's endorsement!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MapLight if really wanted to track the influence of money in politics, would be helping us investigate @JeffRosen for what he did with @mldauber  to get a judge recalled in 2018. Not just pay @AnnMRavel  to get Rosen's endorsement and be just as dark with her funds!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AnnRavel was funded by Soros ( MAPLIGHT) , which I never saw do anything it claimed to do. Ravel, Like @JackieLaceyDA, was backed by crooked @Jeff_Rosen  who wants to be a @netflix star. He won't be. And won't keep his day job if I do mine!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks have plenty of local projects and other reporters cover those national issues. Right now we are on the 2018 election and not the CCW case @Jeff_Rosen wants people to focus on- we are on him and the 6000 emails with @mldauber  that stink of public corruption.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going to teach reporters how to cover  @SantaClaraDA  big public corruption case involving the @SCCoSheriff and the 2018 election. Taking you step by step- here is the pleading filed for @Jeff_Rosen  and #JohnChase - today a response is due.  https://t.co/ESSQE3IVa2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With this media attention and public outrage on this case- what do you think happens to victims who try to speak up when it isn't Jeffrey Epstein? Happening everywhere- No compliance with Marsy's Law- it is a culture - welcome to the investigation. They are not happy to have us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We recently found @SCSCourt is secreting the divorce cases of lawyers, judges and powerful Silicon Valley tech executives - @jkbjournalist welcome to our world- sealing, private judges and prosecutors who abuse their discretion initiate public trust in our legal system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Already did- 56 year old grandma recording the police, judges and lawyers to shine the light- anyone can do it. Everyone should until we know we have transparency and accountability that assures our courts are fair and the rule of law actually applies!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wonder that too Disclosure for possible bias is important - but far more interested to hear about his legal rulings and what those who appeared in his court have to say about him. Lawyers, defendants and crime victims- those are the voices that matter when we talk about judges.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ummmm even on that Supreme Court justice thing, don't count your chicks before they are hatched. So many tricks and barriers that keep most folks from getting their day in court or a fair hearing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like the pile divorce attorney Brad Baugh wheeled over to a private judge- maybe he was retweeting this so thought they didn't have to report it on their taxes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listen to the voices - it is what these folks say that matters more than what the judges and insiders say when they pass out appointments and awards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hugging little girls on a political campaign does little for girls or boys  living in abusive homes, or in poverty. @SenKamalaHarris did little for little girls who were not believed or protected by police, judges or a very broken court system. Not as DA or Senator. #Watching<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SCCgov @SCSCourt  prosecutors bunker from home,  public defenders  appear and victims are denied video  of proceedings- phone lines  don't work and judges are rude,  impatient and not ready for this technology. One prosecutor  dropped off line when a judge issued orders to him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DAs do not prosecute 90% of crimes related to family court. And family court judges are biased old prosecutors who will not believe you even with police reports and evidence. Going to take more than a few protests to change the culture.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrodesmi have some ice cream and go to bed. We won't let anyone forget- #SethSmith!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Calling you out on this one @chesaboudin - can't be tough on police misconduct if these cases are silently dropped without explaining - this case dropped three months before George Floyd died. No pass on the silence !  https://t.co/wH7JDAY5NG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be fair ,  going to fact check this hard. @GackleReport  we know how to check how victims are treated, if Marsy's law is being followed and  if @Cal_OES  funds are  being spent as intended. @Jeff_Rosen failed miserably  in this area- so we know how to assure all is in  order.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Best part of 2020- watching corrupt @SantaClaraDA  hang out in Zoom cages where only 72 folks are listening to their crap. This is #SinunuTowery trying to promote @Jeff_Rosen  two days before the @PostOpinions called him out because @pulcrano wouldn't. #reportlocal  https://t.co/kVEL4VvrCX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An important step - DAs all over the country better be paying attention- bye bye @Jeff_Rosen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe time @JeffRosen and #KaseyHalcon start thinking twice about playing games in cases involving journalists. Do you think they know how many people in their office leaking real documents that spoil their court corruption gig and Marsy's Law violations?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BubbleSanJose It didn't show up anywhere- that happens lots here!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BubbleSanJose Bribes and public corruption aren't easy to spot. For example, #WomenSV presents it is offering " support services" for affluent women in @LosAltosVillage when in reality acting as a referral network for divorce lawyers #JimHoover #NicoleFord #HectorMoreno et al.  https://t.co/khu6dHkOCh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anything is possible, including it went to secondary employment for all the cops willing to cover the player misconduct up !  This happened as they were trying to lower their tax bill. Maybe it was a down payment on that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well all those " embarrassing cases" here always disappear. @Jeff_Rosen had the Lugaresi case out of @LGMSPolice who botched it in 2012, 2017 and 2020 - that involved LDS , trafficking - pedophilia and sexual violence Rosen doesn't want us to worry our pretty little heads about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PattyFilice sole million in commissions as an unlicensed real estate broker for @InteroRE - claw back those ill begotten gains and you could buy houses for everyone!  26 years and 400 plus transactions!  https://t.co/GCASGseVYK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sliccardo and @Jeff_Rosen never concerned with stolen valor divorce lawyer who lied for 40 years about serving in Vietnam!  https://t.co/j0VSGRwYo1    Fact check and #reportlocal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, now we are concerned with veterans- nobody seemed to worry when this lawyer spent 40 years telling everyone in the county he severed in Vietnam, and never did.  https://t.co/j0VSGRwYo1  https://t.co/ykB9eimUFM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jed York - was when all the players were getting charged for rape or dv. The county told me they had no records. San Jose never responded to the request and that is about the time @Jeff_Rosen started prosecuting me for recording the cops who broke my hand and searched my phone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Karma is not wishing ill ! It is the justice that is hard to get in court  these days!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, there was an event - big announcement - claimed for poor areas of the city and " community outreach"- all the @SantaClaraDA  and @sjpdchief lapdogs begging for the funds- when I requested the records of how it was spent- crickets!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just know Dauber got 6000 emails worth of public resources to keep @Jeff_Rosen in office and to get Cindy Hendrickson on the bench where she is pouring the money to lawyers and @Google donors!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yea, remember when you partnered with the @49ers  and got $1 million for community outreach that never made it to the public records or city budget? Would pay for lots of garbage - speaking of @Jeff_Rosen @sliccardo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sliccardo and @Jeff_Rosen  waste more than that per day for their real estate kickbacks. Maybe if Rosen did his job and clawed back the millions  #PattyFilice @InteroRE  made as unlicensed brokers , there wouldn't be homeless who needed the $20 handouts daily. Give me a break!  https://t.co/M1KkoQ0WiC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and @Jeff_Rosen  uses Hitler's playbook to stay in office. They are quite the corruption team !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right!  @JeffRosen @SantaClaraDA  doing such an excellent job  of public protection,  ill concerned that a real estate agent #PattyFilice has been selling real estate for @InteroRE  for 26 years without a license ! You guys really stink when it comes to " educating " the public.  https://t.co/OnPq8zNSTE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CityofVallejo has been a media and social media focus for some time. From corrupt cops to elected officials WTF is going on in a city of that size?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks @NateGartrell  , this is now the law. You are the best at staying on top of the court and DA issues in @CCCounty - they are lucky to have you !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This would be $50 million in Silicon Valley - we have more sun and lots more corruption!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will pile on too!  This  is the " news" outlet that ran with the false narrative created by @StanfordLaw @Mldauber and @Jeff_Rosen  to rig the Brock Turner case and the 2018 election that recalled a judge and got Rosen re- elected! @CA_FPPC  another complicit watchdog?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is not a gender issue, but speaking on a personal level, I find it more outrageous when women do this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting: Unlicensed driver gets this-  as @InteroRE agent #PattyFilice sells  400 plus properties in the  state  without a license, for 26 years,  and no law enforcement agency is stopping her @SantaClaraDA  has jurisdiction! Maybe  donated to @Jeff_Rosen  w/  stolen profits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is the answer every agency gives it is a racket - @StateBarCA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope- @SenKamalaHarris  had @Jeff_Rosen  on public corruption and giving kickbacks to employees who supported his 2010 campaign, she let him off, he got worse. Happens everywhere. Need local reporters to be on it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice find. Relates to a timeline that was very significant in a number of ways. #reportlocal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meaning, no and will take it under submission and will issue a written ruling which is protected by " discretion" and which will take you 2 years and $75K to appeal. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You are entitled! It is a long road, with lots of bumps and bruises. We appreciate you brining us on the journey and hope we help make it a little more bearable. Next Tuesday try ice cream. Makes morning easier ! On time helps when you add the " u" to that time of day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is what divorce lawyers in Silicon Valley do every day. Welcome to my world! I am actually trying to listen to the boys, girls , moms and dads who have been sounding the alarm long before Alan Dershowitz had that kind of power!  https://t.co/kZa4tBHhzh<|endoftext|>

He spewed his toxic plan that was lapped up by other lawyers and absorbed into the subconscious of the judges who awarded these lawyers millions in fees without any regard for the families they stole from.  https://t.co/W2cp946lFa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apply it locally. Not just a Trump problem. Has crept into every community across the country, maybe the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It has been the lack of " newspaper " coverage that has allowed things to get to this point. Cities and counties across the state have quashed civil rights cases through bogus risk management programs that cover up everything from police misconduct to public corruption.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We need this branch of the @ACLU_SoCal @ACLU_NorCal to double down when it comes to rights for cops, victims,and journalists who record the police.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeGascon  how are you going to do your job? We are watching. @latimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Duh - can we pay for ink to cover real local news? Not stenographic journalism!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Military Service Deposition Testimony by Silicon Valley Divorce Lawyer B...  https://t.co/iq67G3N1Hd via @YouTube.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavisVanguard  beat you and he teaches law and journalism students about the court and how to report on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone of those stories is important. You make them not hidden and your storytelling tops the pros.Feels like being prison pen pals. It changes  how we think. Thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PattyFilice @InteroRE have even better terms in @SCCgov  family court private judge cases. Right? @coldwellbanker  @Compass @kwri @remax @nardotrealtor @CA_DRE #reportlocal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So amazing judges are denying video in CA - victims and defendants as well as court watchers have a right to see what is happening in those proceedings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did they give you a phone number and access number for remote access?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do not need to go to NY to find this- and it isn't always families rejecting them- @NateGartrell listen to the noise in @CCCounty and @SCCgov - family courts are separating families and media silence on this is simply unacceptable in 2020!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveCortese -  Patty Filice sold  over 400 homes, including transactions for veterans in @SCCgov . She has not had a license since 1994.  Patty was first brought to the @SantaClaraDA 's attention in 2015. @Jeff_Rosen  did nothing - this is on you as Supervisor as this unfolds.  https://t.co/niMe9rRGkZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What program in school - are they having kids fundraise?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@REAgentPostCard  We are investigating a real estate fraud case where it appears @InteroRE Patty Filice has not had a valid broker's license for 26 years. Impact on sellers, buyers, title, insurance, roofers, staging, landscapers, inspectors and now you remind me printers !  https://t.co/T9J0sPgik6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you have the court , department, time and call in number ? Would like to listen to make sure everyone is doing their job!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When it is your experience, it is 100%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1 of 2: Song lyrics that unleashed retaliation that you can't believe. These were the holiday song sung by family law judges and lawyers as they mocked divorcing couples revealed their greed " get me to the bank tonight" and schemes " I need the deed" at the @sanjoserotary  https://t.co/T6wMM7pl1X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks familiar- only applied locally to @StanfordLaw professor @mldauber  and her emails with @Jeff_Rosen that rigged the 2018 election and didn't seem to bother anyone at the @CA_FPPC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He was smart, and his mom did a good job unleashing him to keep learning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, wants to be AG - President.  More concerned w/ political strategy to stay in  office than  real crimes or protecting real crime victims. This is what happens when local governments don’t keep a leash on ambitious and corrupt DAs who are elected and county employees.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and not same rate as those who put them there @SantaClaraDA  appearing via Zoom in hearings and even dropping off calls. Defendants not getting heard and sent back to jail, public defenders showing up to court and risk getting sick every time.  Local governments have to balance!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right-we all have our own lens, but we move forward every time we look  together- like looking through a telescope at the stars or staring at the same moon.  We may all see something different, but we see best when we look together and have a full view.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And remember what this looks like in court! The culture is systemic it is not singularly race, or gender, it is entitlement. It is prosecutors who are paid 10 times more than PD and judges appointed 7:1 prosecutors v. Public Defenders.  Collective Voice - it impacts us all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good me too! Louder together!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavisVanguard spreading quickly- thier publications and @CourthouseNews  seem to be the only ones coming close to covering courts in California.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree on the net loss- worry about long term mental health issues that will spill over in ways we can not even imagine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am 56 and have experience in that are. Also have sons who do not behave badly and am proud of that. Be mindful  that when we attack in generalities we divide and prejudice. Better to go together and address the behavior.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amazes me that people might be upset about this on #VeteransDay.  How many holidays do you think those boys in I, II, Korea, and Vietnam missed? Such a First world problem when we complain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And nobody seems to notice and nobody seems to care especially the judges who put them there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrodesmi  what #sethsmith saw ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is your town @notguiltyCHI  , not NC- thoughts on what you see as we move into winter?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>See what is happening in #Berkeley it is Democracy in action when it comes to the defunding discussions. @MADDOnline  and community leaders and activists tackling police issues better than most communities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOW @GeorgeGascon  take note.  This will be your job, don’t let others do it. @SCCgov that means @SaraCody could be paying attention to police misconduct since @Jeff_Rosen  was too busy supporting @JackieLaceyDA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too cold and too stormy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have several moms this happened to - expungements promised that never come. Laws not followed on the other side. Watchdogs not functioning and all at a hefty tax bill we can no longer afford.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to retrain every person to not make this behavior gender based. For 8 years our team has investigated family courts. We have heard it and seen it all. Distraction by way of gender is what  those in every system count on.  Good point - focus on behavior, not gender.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Close down bars and indoor gathering places - young people think they are immune!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProjectLincoln  The Jones Day firm is not new to harassing litigation , it is what they do. Not to mention they are super bullies and whine when tables are turned. These are the problems we get when judges don't do their job and discipline lawyers- Canon 3d2!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you think anyone remembers how to do that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really? We have been following non- Trump cases involving Jones Day  and you have the audacity to whine about being harassed ! HA ! @StateBarCA will do nothing - but when Trumps money runs out you may have revenue issues !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOL - that is the best description I have heard when describing anything related to the courts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welcome to the world of the indigent dealing with the legal system. @DavisVanguard  reporters are doing an excellent job of covering the courts. Naming the judges, lawyers and the obvious struggles!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent - having been in farming for nearly 30 years, it is commonly known that we waste so much we could feed every hungry family with what we toss out! @ucdavis  is the place to do this work!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks promising - now we all need to do our job to make sure it is a reality!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really good article. @DavisVanguard is training journalists and future lawyers to understand the importance of a properly written police report. Delicate balance between victims and defendants- proceedings need to be fair for both ! @MADDOnline<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoogleNewsInit is dangerous but  laughable @pulcrano and  fake outrage- Dan is  king of predatory antirust activity. He used relationships at @sanjoserotary , and has legal, money and family issues as he preyed on smaller publications. Now he whines? LOL  https://t.co/AbibDJWGqj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pull quote of the day: @GeorgeGascon looks like they will make sure you do your job. Reporters will have to cover police and prosecutors differently from 2020 forward.  https://t.co/eyiUGXYYW9<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Interesting @Jeff_Rosen charged this case and tries to sound like a tough guy when in fact he had a human trafficking case dumped on his desk in 2012 out of @LGMSPolice  and dropped the charges- feds now investigating and this connected to Rosen's buddies!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And my 26 year old told me he was going out last weekend - it doesn't impact the young. How do we convince them??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABAesq  - When it comes to public trust @StateBarCA has failed miserably  - prosecutorial misconduct is rampant and divorce lawyers steal with impunity. Attorney trust accounts launder money and fraud on the court is a general business practice these days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ethics- I try to see what our kids see that means following complaints to the @StateBarCA the @CA_DRE and all public protection watchdogs. So far- they are not looking very productive - or effective when it comes to public protection.  https://t.co/hM4OjuhTiJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gonna make sure to cover both sides. That means best criminal defense and @MADDOnline - remember what I said about those jury questions!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is how we create fake news. We must disclose our bias, our conflicts and anything that can impact public trust in our reporting. @megynkelly - you have a doozy with #RuthPatrick 2019 interview !  https://t.co/Z4OPxY5GAh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For too long we have given celebrities and the most powerful these platforms. We also haven't investigated the women who knew and allowed this to go on. Always wanted to interview #JerrySandusky's wife!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As someone duped by  #RuthPatrick &amp; @WomenSV shortly before a stint on @megynkelly -can't understate  harm in in using your position in the media to give credibility.

<|startoftext|>@Dalrymple Investigating real estate broker associate #PattyFilice who appears to not have had a valid brokers  license since 1994. Rolling investigation of systemic failures that allowed it to happen from @CA_DRE  to @MLS and @InteroRE  https://t.co/Lj8CyAknEr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B0bHale Hope you don't support profitability at any cost! @InteroRE allowed #PattyFilice to sell real estate and be court appointed to sell real estate even though she didn't have a valid broker's license since 1994 !  https://t.co/C7z4nkgU1Z<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mlslistingsinc How many things had to fail for @InteroRE #PattyFilice to not have a valid broker's license since 1994 , yet be listed on MLS as an Intero Broker Associate for 400 transactions in @SCCgov - we are investigating  systemic failures.  https://t.co/C7z4nkgU1Z<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InmanNews @nardotrealtor  posted this video to show connection to  real estate and divorce cases in CA:  https://t.co/lQsmrWTHzS whistleblower pointed out @InteroRE agent #PattyFilice has not had a valid license for 26 years- 400 transactions. Investigating how this could happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you are interested, @SantaClaraDA @Jeff_Rosen worked on changing laws in such cases to ponderance of evidence after rigging the Brock Turner case and the 2018 election to recall Judge Persky. It was a popular #metoo push to get Rosen re- elected. Info from that may help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jury duty  in @SCCgov on a DUI case- jurors were questioned about  donations to @MADDOnline, an amazing screening question to determine potential bias - we need to be asking cops, lawyers and judges the same questions to assure fair hearings. @notguiltyCHI @josephtullylaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every government employee should make this donation because before they are government employees they are human beings!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you never thought of the importance of @EFF and the work they do now to address issues that will later impact our communities, our courts and our politics, better start!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Now that the election is over - hope every reporter will get back to local reporting. Our Democracy and our future depends on it.  Spent yesterday filming the damage from the California Wildfires and interviewing families who have the long road to recovery ahead.  Don’t forget!  https://t.co/TE8nt4Q52y<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeff_Rosen  This is 2020 - we are dealing with rampant  white collar crime, public corruption, police misconduct and COVID and @SCCgov most powerful public official still talking about 2018 prosecutions, his father's death and his re- election. My reporting mission- #Indictments  https://t.co/OmihV9RlkY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't break the public trust- pursue the white coats and white collar crimes with the same zeal you pursue murderer cases.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, it is a group effort- public resources, and moral compass need to focus on the larger issues, don't forget the pill farms and prescription mills. Doctors deserve to be prosecuted  if they break the law too - white coats and white collar can do as much, or more harm!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right - there is lots to do locally- too much media and public attention sucked out of our communities to watch national politics these past 4.5 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chesaboudin  to reform - you are going to have to start looking at family court and white collar crime. Imagine what a spouse divorcing a lawyer could do to deserve being sanctioned $1 million in a divorce case.   @LeahGillisLaw @notguiltyCHI @ScottHech @DavisVanguard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Falcone v. Fkye: Divorce case and  criminal case   by @SantaClaraDA.  @Jeff_Rosen  waited 3 years before reading the file. then dismissed, never investigating the private judge and  lawyer who got  $1 million in sanctions.  Still no answers on how this was justice in a divorce.  https://t.co/klmbtI1H3W<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone who suffers from a crime as you have understands that the process must be fair and transparent for everyone, or it will always feel unjust. Thank you for always showing us your grace and for taking us on your journey so we can learn!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IMO the moment a spouse tries to bring legitimate abuse, fraud or other claims that should be handled in civil court - the judges and the lawyers turn on the person making the claims, unless they are the ones with the money. Then their claims become the script for the case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Courts have turned to using domestic violence and civil harassment orders as the greatest fee generating opportunity for lawyers. Divorce lawyers are now making $50- 100,000 more in a case by adding in DV claims  that have criminal implications. Now migrating to civil cases too.  https://t.co/F8rob48E5X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Journalistic ethics require unbiased reporting.  In 2020 that has proven to be  impossible from COVID to elections.   What reporters tell their children matters. @DavisVanguard is a good man and suspect his daughter will say a good dad. Bonus is he is a publisher as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never forget how important this job is- do better than @SantaClaraDA @Jeff_Rosen who hired those @chesaboudin fired for prosecutorial misconduct. Local news needs to assure transparency of our DA offices.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most insidious practice in our legal  system  is the use of private judges. Litigants are confused as when being appointed they are called, referees, Special Masters, and temporary judges. There is nothing temporary,   or transparency,  about them!  https://t.co/HD6pEv5N5G<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this one is on that list too based on my research!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't take @SantaClaraDA word for it - read the emails! @Jeff_Rosen told a woman trying to report human trafficking if her advocate emailed his office again, they would seek a restraining order- now feds involved wondering about Rosen and Judge James Towery's role in that case!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good job on the looking. @NateGartrell always one of the best reporters covering the courts. Many reporters don't bother to look, and most don't know how!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WATCH THE JUDGE - it is part of reporting on the courts !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone ever wonder why we can commit people of murder without a body ( @Jeff_Rosen ) , but prosecutors can't seem to add it up on white collar crimes and public corruption . Hmmm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Family court cases never get the attention they deserve- domestic violence brushed off by prosecutors for folks to deal with themselves in family court. Murder - fraud and DV all the same, but prosecutors seem to think going after protestors is a better use of public funds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sliccardo Guess what city will be next!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Math! Add that one pulled from the vault of injustice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is up with Brentwood!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Betting you will get crickets on that question! But good question!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After 5 years @valeriehoughton &amp; real estate investor Terry Houghton had felony charges dropped by the @SantaClaraDA. She posted this Tweet,  despite the fact @SCCgov noted her hubby falsely obtained his public defender through fraud. MLK quote probably not appropriate!  https://t.co/FlgwHHzpid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should never be done by cops and DAs it is like letting your children decide who was right and who was wrong in a fight. The relationship between police and prosecutors has  to be the thing we really change in 2021.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been watching these protests since the 1970s in the East Bay. Now I watch  how police handle the mask issues. Arrests for First Amendment activity-  folks in paddy wagons and jails without masks seems to be cruel  and unusual punishment. Also seems to be a reporting opportunity!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Money is creating the culture. Now they can't stop- so we persist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No due process, and certainly no fairness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrodesmi when done with the private judge video, have some crooked real estate agents locked up and have some sleep- going to do a project on @UCBerkeley and @berkeleypolice  that I hope will help you get some sleep!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>" Broker associate" Patty Filice of @InteroRE hasn't had a valid broker's license since 1994. Meaning  when she filed her income and expense declaration,  in the court,  in her divorce, and those declarations as a court appointed real estate agent..... @SantaClaraDA do your job!  https://t.co/dgf26Xz6Wv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Working on my next videos about this. It is spreading everywhere!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onemomsbattle promoted your website, we have to tell it better so more understand,.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not just kids killed or who commit suicide  in connection with their parents divorce, it's about the ones who live through the lingering impact when courts allow these cases to drag on 5-10 years , essentially their entire childhood, all for money ! Not a month, it is decades.  https://t.co/SGaRuhQkrc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@legalella Who is doing the #FamilyCourtAwareness Month and how can I help? Have more stories than you can shake a stick at - Got video? Will turn it into something! This is what this reporting looks like:  https://t.co/x3lBTJUOrr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BTW- #UlfCarlson from the film, his lawyer was the wife of the nightstalker cop who killed and raped women in CA for 30 years and just got caught. His judge, committed structural error and killed Ulf's employment. Nobody cared. Ulf left the country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Already got it! In @SCCgov they are appointing attorneys as private judges so fast the judges can't keep up- these lawyers are charging upwards of $100K and dragging the cases our 5-10 years. @nytimes was to report on our research and findings- ask them where they are on that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If civil and criminal lawyers knew what family law attorneys were doing and how much they have been paid, there would be no more family law attorneys for @Jeff_Rosen to protect.  They are stealing homes, money in trust accounts and kids, and nobody seems to care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kathey Fyke:  sanctioned $1 million , criminally prosecuted because of a corrupt private judge's void orders and referral to the @SantaClaraDA.   Lost her house and son. @SCCgov Lawyers laughed and went out to lunch with the judges. Kathey never awarded fees- declared vexatious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOW more math!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please give up your @Starbucks for a month and donate to @EFF may be one of the most important non profits in our Democracy. It needs to be funded so they can keep up this important work!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@josephtullylaw guess it is okay to pick #Spiderman over #Superman if Spiderman is really a Grandma with super powers! Just remember it is the Grandmas that give you your superpowers, even in a courtroom! - Took this while on a photography teaching assignment and thought of you.  https://t.co/0BKl0oA0z2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a former producer, do wonder what is going to happen to all these events beyond 2021. @MoLapalooza @GilroyGarlicFes @snowglobe from food festivals to concerts- it is lots of money - lifestyles and cop overtime pay that just goes away!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once told a rich guy I had to speak to his wife related to a private judge case I was investigating. He flipped. Politics these days feels the same. Never ceases to amaze how many people flip if I follow or comment on  political adversaries. My job is to cover BOTH sides!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Selective Enforcement- Selective Prosecution - having your cake and eating it too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right so we keep screaming until someone hears!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe @SusanEllenberg @joesimitian @DaveCortese @SupCindyChavez could stop giving @Jeff_Rosen raises and the @SantaClaraDA all the crime victim money and we wouldn't have to fundraise for the harm @Jeff_Rosen did for 10 years in @SCCgov<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notguiltyCHI  family  vs. criminal courts more similar than most  realize :  Level Legal Playing Field ( not PD to prosecutor - not pro se to represented )  Fairness- meaning a judge:  1. Discloses conflicts   2. Has meaningful oversight  3. Assures transparency<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You are right - for the best lawyers I know, it is not about the money, but the law. Same applies for journalists. We just lose some along the way!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These past few years would have to say too many journalists focused on the Trump presidency have been more concerned  about opinions and personal bias than facts. Disagree courts have more integrity based on what we have seen in family and criminal courts these past 10 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Three weeks since the @CA_DRE @SantaClaraDA  knew #PattyFilice has been selling real estate in @SCCgov without a brokers or agent's license. She is still selling. @InteroRE cashing in on fraud and nobody seems to be doing their job in the area of public protection. @AAABoRtweets  https://t.co/cJZkGmvYIU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Long overdue -needed for all the folks @Jeff_Rosen locked up over his career as he let  white collar criminals run around with impunity. Enough to make anyone insane! #PattyFilice - @InteroRE fraud for 26 years- stealing homes from families.  @DaveCortese you paying attention?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrodesmi I always listen to see what #SethSmith was seeing too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wasn't @JoeBiden VP when she was convicted?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is math. Pretty simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yea we see that when you are conducting public meetings and can't seem to add up all the money the local DA @Jeff_Rosen is stealing in state and federal grant money earmarked for crime victims.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juliaioffe how reporters were given access to the @SantaClaraDA  and @mldauber  is a big part of how the public was duped in the 2019 election. When public trust in the media and our local governments is lost, it is our job to investigate why- Got more public records today!  https://t.co/GzYP2rvpx3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Instead of quoting civil rights activists from 50 years ago- we need to look to how we silence truth today. Here and Now! This is the truth no reporter reported on in 2012. Imagine the distrust these children have, even in love!  https://t.co/KjFSDwrSUG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure there are any reporters, editors, producers or publishers listening, but gonna keep talking !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It does happen everyday- and with all the journalist locked down in 2020, would think we could start reporting on what is happening in America as we thought it only happened somewhere else. It won't matter who is president in 2021 if this is still going on and not being reported.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you for sharing - we have to keep saying it until we do more than just feel devastated!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happens everyday from traffic to family court - the judges and lawyers who know it is being done, then go out for drinks, golf and lunch !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You do realize they all know right ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe this will be the E- Ticket to get folks to start paying attention to courts- lawyers and judges appointed in federal, state and family courts!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Always amazes me that we focus abroad before we peek in our own backyard. #ReportLocal guys, it matters!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember we have local politicians doing the same. We need to focus on local elections - they matter far more where we work, live and raise our families. We have simply neglected these local elections as voters, reporters and citizens and it shows!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should have been done years ago ! Can't wait to have folks denied due process and fair hearings voting for our next duly elected DAs. That is how it should be - hope they exercise those rights!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How many reporters working on public corruption silently curse the targets of their reporting projects?  Have to keep catching myself. Last thought I had on @JeffRosen started with a "C" and ended with an " R". Flashback to Sound of Music- "Forgive me  reverend mother for I..."  https://t.co/obaPsg5uvE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad that we have to pick a DA, the most powerful political position in a community,  based on the lesser of two evils. I have yet to find any prosecutor that should be elected these days, even @KamalaHarris has some baggage in that area from her days in SF. @sfchronicle @latimes  https://t.co/lYtMd70kT5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZivaBranstetter  my hoodie today!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@latimes- If you  haven't been reading my feed- THE DA &amp; SHERIFF votes you cast in your community today will be more important than the vote you cast for President. Don't ask a judge, ask a criminal defense lawyer or a journalist prosecuted for 3 years for recording the police.  https://t.co/vtjCYMhofq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You guys rock ! Wear those shirts everyday - not just on election day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fixfamilycourts This is the case law that says judges can't hide their own divorce cases- didn't say judges follow the law.  https://t.co/ewV5UvmyRm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pbsteachers really time to start teaching teachers about what their students face when parents are in a divorce or custody battle than can rage on for 10 years- the kids know. FYI- this is not your parents' 1970 divorce case!  https://t.co/BsjofS2GIO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You beat me by one boy- but know I work as if I have 100!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The law says judges can't hide their divorce cases. I didn't say judges, or court staff,  were actually following the law. We saved Judge Grilli's divorce files - now the court is hiding them in  a database! @FACoalition @DavisVanguard @notguiltyCHI @LeahGillisLaw @ScottHech  https://t.co/Txixyma4Hs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SCSCourt  gave themselves an award for their ' data system" - last year we saved the divorce files from controversial family court Judge Mary Ann Grilli ( yes, her hubby was actually named Guido ).  Today noticed the court has hidden this case in that award winning database!  https://t.co/L19pUJIme7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some of my favorites from the emails that didn't bother @CA_FPPC  https://t.co/8bX0tsiyXe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hendrickson  accessed the criminal database to help @mldauber- from her government email sent Dauber her CV and got support for her campaign. They schemed with PAC money from out of state to recall Persky -  Dauber subpoenaed; @Jeff_Rosen is selective prosecution champ !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CCW case  they tried to recuse Rosen for conflicts. Judge Geffon denied - Court of Appeal ruled @Jeff_Rosen has a tad of a problem!  https://t.co/dr8wYTPrKB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, and neither @Jeff_Rosen  or @mldauber  disclosed the " in kind " of the event at @SantaClaraUniv  with @sharonstone on their 460 forms- @CA_FPPC  not bothered - local publishers @pulcrano and @mercnews - not bothered either!  https://t.co/oPfesAzS7i<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has anyone seen the rule of law in 2020?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Publicly claimed to oppose the recall- public records show he and his top DAs gave @mldauber  3 years of resources and information to succeed in the recall- Cindy Hendrickson led the charge then took Persky's job-  https://t.co/RNDoBWymUn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a big deal- Judge Eric Geffon, a former criminal defense attorney has sold out to support a corrupt @SantaClaraDA - Sixth District about to get real with @Jeff_Rosen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So to be balanced- why not interested in @Jeff_Rosen misusing his government email accounts to support the #reacallPersky campaign?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are we   asking courts and cops to do too much these days? In the hearings I have remotely watched these past few months, nothing appears to resemble due process. So much confusion, no support for defendants and victims, nobody watching. Means no checks and balances.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gradually, the reality of police officers inflating reports and testimony is being addressed in our criminal courts. Thank you @DavisVanguard  for covering these stories- so important !<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kwri -  Patty Filice acted in 400 real estate  transactions claiming as a  " broker associate " of @InteroRE , turns out she had a corporate license,  no broker license. Many wondering how @CA_DRE missed that for 26 years.  https://t.co/gv0E2szbae<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnHartRE ...Thoughts on how it could be that one person could spend 26 years selling real estate, 400 transactions, without an agent or broker's license while representing they were a " broker associate " of @InteroRE   https://t.co/gv0E2szbae<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For those of you who can vote, remember who you elect for DA or Sheriff will impact your life and community more than who becomes President for the next 4 years. If I do my job, @Jeff_Rosen will be indicted!  https://t.co/dHc40KwuFK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miracle the 6th District Court of Appeal issued this order, it remains baffling why the courts around her always appear to be asking " pretty please " @JeffRosen should absolutely be called in to be questioned by the Justices.

<|startoftext|>@InteroRE  appears to have had an unlicensed real estate broker working for them. For 26 years! Let's see what @CA_DRE will do ... https://t.co/pDdiOZzEam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have those policies and procedures. Any bets on @Jeff_Rosen needing a new career in 2021? Eric Geffon? He is presiding judge in criminal court.

<|startoftext|>After 5 years, @SantaClaraDA @Jeff_Rosen dropped criminal charges on @valeriehoughton - had she been poor,  or of color, she would have been in jail, not in family  court getting appointed to represent kids. @notguiltyCHI @josephtullylaw @radleybalko @GavinNewsom @DavisVanguard  https://t.co/jjynXxxRrn<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Charges: Violating a local rule CRC 10.613 ( made up by local lawyers and judges) - Violating a standing order when I filmed the police , and resisting arrest for doing it. AFTER they broke my hand! It is common for DAs to charge to cover up for crooked and untrained @SCCoSheriff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Journalist  prosecuted for recording cops:  When represented by a public defender,  just seems a matter of public interest to share the badass work of @LeahGillisLaw defending our rights when it comes to police and prosecutor misconduct! @thesajidakhan @notguiltyCHI @radleybalko  https://t.co/hkAqpiXYcs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It goes on and on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ImmJusticeNOW  @Mldauber - literally rigged an election and stole resources as an immigrant was raped in her Los Gatos garage and ignored in a divorce case before James Towery. She is NO friend of actual rape and human trafficking victims!  https://t.co/RqIJLba6nX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mldauber protects racist abusers steal children from their mothers - rigged the 2018 election- wants  kids to follow her like a 2nd coming of Jim Jones. We have the emails and the 460 Forms. This woman has no business being an "educator" . Shameful - go take care of your son!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She should know , she did in in 2018. at tax payer expense as real rape victims went to her for help and were ignore. Projecting! I can't wait to do this woman's deposition. She is a liar!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Liar ! Shameful -Don't forget that subpoena is live   and you are going to be in court talking about how you and @JeffRosen rigged the election and packed the court with your PAC money from out of state.  Cindy Hendrickson is more harmful to women than Persky ever was!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mldauber should know, got Cindy Hendrickson on the bench &amp;  Persky recalled with lots of out of state money. While ignoring judges like James Towery,  who actually set midnight hearings, ignored women raped in human trafficking cases and more! #MIcheleDauber is a dangerous liar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Public Record Joke : This is @Jeff_Rosen big budget proposal ? WTF a third grader in Gilroy could do better. How about investigating #PattyFilice and @InteroRE  for selling family homes in Gilroy without a license?  https://t.co/xNTXtSoToe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pulcrano  remember when @SantaClaraDA PIO Sean Webby was copsplaining why @Jeff_Rosen  let the rapist go in the San Martin Rape case?

<|startoftext|>Field Trip to Alabama: @SantaClaraDA x 19- breakfast, lunch , dinner, flight, hotel &amp; entrance to museums paid for by @SCCgov taxpayers. @LeahGillisLaw gets $175 for a half day motion, lunch not included! @notguiltyCHI @radleybalko @latimes @sfexaminer @svdebug @NAACP  https://t.co/G6wkDTJtKG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yea, think we stole your playbook , added some tech and......Stacy Capps's expense report. How many teachers. nurses. students or kids ever get a trip like this? They learned nothing.

<|startoftext|>I want every PUBLIC DEFENDER who has to go into the jail during COVID  to see what the @SantaClaraDA  was doing with public funds one year ago !!! This is what corruption looks like and we pay for it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How many kids could have benefited from this trip! Happened as DA claimed he didn't have the resources to prosecute a rape case with a positive ID and SART kits- but he had enough money for this and a host of petty crime prosecutions.  Corruption =@Jeff_Rosen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1964: Freedom Riders took a bus.    2019 @Jeff_Rosen  to 19 top DA staffers: Hey let's fly to Alabama on a drinking trip disguised as a "racism education course" .

<|startoftext|>Endorsements matter- Note to self : @Jeff_Rosen funding and supporting #JackieLacey- that should drive every LA voter to vote for @GeorgeGascon - These DA elections matter most folks - be an educated voter - know why ! @chesaboudin @SajidMusicKhan @LeahGillisLaw @latimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>8 years and hundreds of stories, each more heart wrenching then the last. So many years and so many families and children harmed. This was a protest at 2015 Super bowl .

<|startoftext|>It feels that way - but this is worse ! Secret - hidden- like being in a rape tent. It is all part of a scheme that a small group of lawyers use and few can or will fight. It is outright corruption in our courts, with no transparency.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just walked my dog - can tell you in @TownLG and all over @SCCgov few people showed signs of " fear and anxiety" - we need leadership locally too !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could we maybe report on what police officers are doing locally? There is plenty to report on here instead of going to NYPD to get a story. Yes, they all knew about YouTube long before MSM figured that out after George Floyd and Karen in Central Park.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I counted 45 women actually raped and beaten who went to @mldauber  for help- let's just say they didn't get the book deal and media attention Dauber and @Jeff_Rosen assured ONE victim as others suffered and were ignored. It is shameful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PAC funding came from out of state. Her own house rotting at the foundation. She will move on to @LosGatosHigh  and @joesimitian next- IMO she is dangerous and has done nothing for anyone but herself. ( @DaveCortese  has bought her protection for 2020 ) just watch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mldauber created a media blitz - an experiment in public corruption. Reporters too busy to fact check her - she used public resources, aligned with the public corruption machine and right @SantaClaraDA #JeffRosen gave her the keys and immunity for his re- election free pass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Criminal defense lawyers have a special place in my heart. Every vexatious litigant publisher -needs one. @josephtullylaw  if you would just cave on the Superman argument - you would be perfect. You are perfectly media ready and my favorite ! Don't tell @LeahGillisLaw !<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This week we bite the bullet and begin to explain the use of private judges in divorce cases. Meaning a lawyer acting as a "judge" for private pay.

<|startoftext|>@radleybalko saw debate in your hood tonight. Since BOTH @RealTrump and @JoeBiden  brought up #KidsinCages  - Once election is over,  maybe we can start focusing on who is putting kids in #InvisableCages  https://t.co/NRq4D4yRuY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tonight's debate focused on 500 kids separated from their parents at the border. FACT I know that times 1000 from @SCCgov @OCSuperiorCourt @SCCgov @CCCounty alone! BY NAME and DIVORCE CASE! This was @TownLG today where you can't see the #Invisablecages  https://t.co/PyfqIZVGiE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Learned #PageWelton passed away in 2018- was one of my favorite realtors. If I find out she lost business to Patty Filice while Patty didn't even have a broker's license ..  https://t.co/C7z4nkgU1Z  https://t.co/YV3njzBJ9W<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WikiRealtyPro Did  #PattyFilice have a broker's license when she sold 400 homes  @SCCgov as a " Broker Associate" for @InteroRE - not on the DRE website- no answer from thee Intero offices all week. @LosGatosLiving please call me back on that referral fee you paid her in 2010!  https://t.co/Iw9sDCzvA9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whistleblower: #PattyFilice appears to be acting as " Broker Associate" for @InteroRE without a broker's license. Silence all week- If I am wrong, will admit, if not, WTF! @SCCgov who is protecting the family home? @TownLG  https://t.co/H4fDCIhz4k  https://t.co/8IkEeOk2xt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OfficerByron gonna need some more records- Shot apps , etc. @mrodesmi fight is hard enough!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today I broke up a " dispute" between a Dem lawyer, and Rep client over the election. Reminded them whoever wins will not impact them where it matters most. Vote with your local community in mind. The rest is just like sucking air though a mask.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does @NBCNews stand up for all journalists , or just their own? Position on journalists acting improperly on Zoom calls? We are not perfect. We should be tolerant of constructive criticism, and that is how we stand together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love this publisher!! Thank you @DavisVanguard ! Every reporter, editor and publisher MUST start paying attention to crimes committed by cops as they testified as to criminal charges brought against others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This should be a tattoo required for any post judgement related to Silicon Valley and its money!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Drove by Dwight again tonight - realized days are getting shorter and thought of the things you are missing with your son. Campus has opened for students. Will make sure he is not forgotten. @UCBerkeley @ucbyanggang<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When our local governments allow this to become ubiquitous in our communities, you get indifference when it is raised on a national level. How come this year's election feels more like family court than like an exercise in democracy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's do a list. Let's start with everyone lying in a local community and follow it up to a national level. Scratch that, let's make a list of who is NOT lying, there will be enough internet space for that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@berkeleyside @robertsalonga @jennwadsworth @grace_hase @CalMatters @DavisVanguard   @SJSpotlight @SJSU @UCBerkeley   pass it on....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SCCgov has $2 billion in cash reserves- @Walmart  #Germanbanks and investments and other off shore- let's worry about what happens locally before it grows up nationally<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know it is a problem, but I judge people for the divorce lawyer they are willing to hire and what they are willing to pay that lawyer to do to a former spouse. #BradBaugh #PattyFilice @pulcrano @robertsalonga  https://t.co/bZuDRBVfyk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pulcrano Do publishers have vicarious liablity  if they publish,  or allow to be published,  that a person is a licensed real estate agent, when they know they're not? @jennwadsworth #PattyFilice = no license to be @InteroRE agent.   @CA_DRE   https://t.co/4Rw3ZaiB4I<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks guys keep sharing  they see it. @SantaClaraDA  knows it , but would rather use the criminal courts to for weed and photo cases!  https://t.co/cguQ69FnrZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am bad at math too, So I posted this video. Then someone told me #PattyFilice didn't have a license to sell real estate for 10 years - but did it anyway. Somehow adding up those numbers is easier and who cares about followers- just keep doing the math.  https://t.co/cguQ69FnrZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember donating proceeds from one of my #HomeandGarden Shows to the #GilroyAssistanceLeague where Patty Filice was a member . Just didn't know she was unlicensed to sell real estate for @Intero when she was pimping those donations.  https://t.co/0ouVCwbIg0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katfilice and let's face it, #PattyFilice  was always more worried about how things looked than how they really were. But she did have a nice website and expensive purse when she showed up for those #GilroyFoundation and @Rotary events and @PinnacleBank board meetings.  https://t.co/dBt6MGiyCz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katfilice did you design #PattyFilce website? It is really nice, problem is that as she was selling off all those properties, putting that she was an associate broker for @InteroRE , she didn't have a license to say that!  https://t.co/Cu8c1wLIwN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CA_DRE so what happens to an agent who sells real estate for 10 years without the required @InteroRE associate broker license? #PattyFilice not there - confirmed by #DRE  https://t.co/NyUBJ2IEzG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Manager of @oldrepublicpro  in Gilroy told me yesterday that they do lots of business with #PattyFilice of @InteroRE  and he never thought to check if she had the associate broker license she claimed to have- she doesn't ! @CA_DRE  https://t.co/6VbWgpOymB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Counting up #PattyFilice Victims from her @InteroRE fraud that spanned 20 years - add in @coldwellbanker  @GilroyGarlicFes @PinnacleBank customers @GilroyCali @LosGatosRotary @sanjoserotary  https://t.co/6VbWgpOymB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just learned Page Welton passed in 2018. @coldwellbanker  with more integrity than most people I ever met. She too was a victim of @InteroRE #PattyFilice who stole Page's deals and never even had a license to sell property for the 10 years she did it .  https://t.co/6VbWgpOymB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrWarrenBuffet  would  improve the ROI for investors to settle and support local news. #PattyFilice had no associate broker license with @InteroRE - @SantaClaraDA  #JohnChase and @Jeff_Rosen knew.  https://t.co/6VbWgpOymB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I had one question I could ask @WarrenbuffettDT  it would be- Would you be willing to settle some of the @InteroRE #PattyFilice vicarious liability claims and support local news so NO agent could ever sell  a family homes without a license again?   https://t.co/6VbWgpOymB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this is #PattyFilce in the act:  https://t.co/6VbWgpOymB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Visions of Vicarious Liabilities dance in my head...@InteroRE @PinnacleBank @q_berkshirehath  Hint : @CA_DRE  Patty Filice had no license as an Intero Real Estate Agent when she sold that first home back in 2002. Her committing  more fraud:  https://t.co/lUKKddnjko<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After the election I hope every reporter and citizen will take this and apply it- what are the non- profits doing down the block from where you live. What is happening to the money you donate- Think Locally !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love this man- #LOCALELECTIONS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>EDUCATE YOURSELF ON LOCAL ELECTIONS !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People pay attention to your local government! MSM has spent 4 years  obsessed w/ Trump- that has created lots of darkness in communities where information matters far more. Educate yourself on LOCAL ELECTIONS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SCCgov should be embarrassed that in a county of over 2 million they can't get more than 200 people to watch any of this - talk about loss of public trust.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey how about those ignored Public Records @SCCgov  Rosen's calendars overdue- Henrickson's election records still secreted - any reporters doing their job here or just running PR for the in crowd ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Opportunity for more public corruption. Shameful @SupCindyChavez  - #separationofpowers does not mean you sucking up to local judges every chance you get. Voting to award from within is meaningless- let the court users vote ! Until Molly O Neal stands up to Rosen, she is useless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SupCindyChavez and @Jeff_Rosen made big appearance in Rosen's new  "documentary" . Really should stick to their day jobs ! Wait ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOW - two weeks before an election- COVID - homelessness and closed courts and Supervisor @SusanEllenberg takes her privilege  to talk about missing her tea from @peetscoffee - #OUTOFTOUCH! Shameful !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really try to do that - and agree !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look into joining #IRE - get the training. Practice from your community - start your platform !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are you just beginning? Raised three boys and will write a whitepaper to support that theory.   BTW #DarwinAwards 99 percent guys!   Would ask- why couldn't this wait- is this what " working from home" means to men these days? Gross!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YES , YES and YES- it matters more than national elections and coverage! Save the @Starbucks until you subscribe to 2 local papers near you !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If just ONE reporter watched for Brown Act Violations - can you imagine what that would do to our Democracy???<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It was always about the real estate ! Silicon Valley agent #PattyFilice appears to have acted as an @InteroRE associate for 10 or more years without the license the law required. Adding up what that means is mind-bending!   https://t.co/GndxJfRX7e  https://t.co/4KeBSMKVND<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey - think of all you did for Seth. You loved it I am sure- but look how he thrived - there are millions of children that could use a little of your magic and sure Seth would not mind the share!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When schools shut I was amazed how overwhelmed working parents were. I worked and raised my sons, but made sure I was there everyday afterschool and on breaks- would not have wanted anyone else to have that time! Don't do it for the parents! Those kids need you most!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Need more of those judges!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So seems real estate in @TownLG  and @DowntownGilroy  is a little more important than @InteroRE  would want it to be  https://t.co/FBzsWt09zD  https://t.co/3jhfWfOKD3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As an old print publisher in Silicon Valley , have to ask : Really this surprises you ? It is not a political issue, it is an opportunity issue. When we leave these gaps, those motivated by greed and profits run the free press. Oh wait..... https://t.co/8X04AJ91gP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>" As applied " we have found similar violations in @SCCgov - at the end of the day, no agency is going to do anything about it. Outrage will fade and a new issue  will follow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOW! you need a new doctor !!! Try a midwife at home?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@InteroRE  #PattyFilice and her court appointments may be a very bad way to drum up business.  https://t.co/C7z4nkyuTx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Decided it was time. Too much of this happens in court files. Mainstream media refuses to cover these issues and when the courts and the police collide in a family law case, it has the potential to do too much harm.  https://t.co/C7z4nkyuTx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least Charles Koch gave more to @Stanford  than #SantaClaraUniversity- wonder if he knows that $26K to SCU went to get @Jeff_Rosen re-elected so he could rig the local elections for @mldauber<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe send him a shirt ?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>WOW- #VicariousLiability isn't a thing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And a @Netflix movie about a topic no other DA has been willing to tackle. @Jeffrosen must be VERY afraid of @GeorgeGascon taking @AGBecerra job, he is backing Lacey hard, right alongside of those police associations.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Or in the case of really corrupt governments, they use whistleblowers to look for leaks and protect the fraud.

<|startoftext|>One of my first videos about this case.  https://t.co/3xjVTTnuMl  A little rough, but enough to give divorce attorney Debra Crawford a little pretrial publicity.

<|startoftext|>This is  case  will  teach reporters how to report on family court.  Divorce lawyer Debra Crawford married her  client's ex husband.

<|startoftext|>When we all look back - aren't we a little ashamed. Compare what white collar crimes took place during this same period, with impunity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And thank you for asking -<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why it is  important to cover family court issues!  Domestic Violence ( DV) is handled in family court. That means when corrupt or complicit DAs won't criminally prosecute a DV case, the wives have to do it.  Often w/o an attorney.  How do you think that is going?  @mldauber  https://t.co/5YY1llLqFG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Local reporting and engagement are more important than ever. Imagine what it would do for our communities if we put as much attention into them as we do presidential elections. IME, political parties matter far less at a local level where we care about similar issues.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>4 of 10 : Local news has  national news problems when it comes to public trust. Having local reporters  who are trusted is the most important asset of a publisher. Source management is the most important aspect of investigative reporting. You can't just hire that- gotta find it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3 of 10 : Loss of journalism programs and basic skills such as records requests have harmed local newsrooms most. Print publishers like me could not compete with @Facebook @Google and other social media that dazzled advertisers as early as 2010.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2 of 10 : Loss of local coverage when it comes to police, lawyers, and judges has created the situation speaking from the streets following the death of George Floyd.

You and @JosephTully top  the #2020 Holiday Book Gift Giving Guide - hope people will use these times to invest in journalism that makes a difference on the issues we ignored for so long! @GideonsArmy615<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Open Source Investigation into charity fraud: @SupCindyChavez @Jeff_Rosen @SantaClaraDA @SCCgov @latc @sanjoserotary @LosAltosChamber @LosAltosVillage @losaltoslibrary @LosAltosPD @TownofLAH @LAConqAthletics @AltosFire @SusanEllenberg @joesimitian  https://t.co/HUmyXIBBe2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@josephtullylaw - in your next edition: : I grew up in Martinez, and Spiderman WAS my favorite superhero, until.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OfficerByron @berkeleypolice - thank you and the city attorneys. Most professional CPRA response on police records to date. Now getting busy doing our job. Thanks for not making this adversarial or difficult. After @SCCgov , you rocked! @dailycal @UCBerkeley @berkeleyside  https://t.co/iyiG7iMmST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny, @AnnRavel on ethics after her corruption related to the 2018 @SCCgov election. She had the emails- she acted outraged over #darkmoney and she was the worst of all. When we keep electing this culture, we lose for four years or more. Ann: Glass houses and all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mldauber is the subject of a current @CA_FPPC  complaint for her conduct during the 2018 election to recall Judge Persky. She was fueled by out- of -state money and donations that never seemed to make it to her disclosures. Now here she goes again. #VoterBeware!  https://t.co/JZ0AtXlLD8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Women who have been raped, beaten and sexually assualted are finally starting to ask: What did @mldauber  do for me or those who would follow? Other than media she brought for #ChanelMiller and out of state #PAC money she brought to keep @SantaClaraDA @Jeff_Rosen in office.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everything is dumbed down- police reports to appeals. Sad. My mom would say it dates back to the elimination of Latin in high school!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God I wish I had video of that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Public comment should be loaded in every community right now- just no excuse for not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PredictivePolicing  and #PoliceSuveillance are part of a culture created and sustained by the elected DA and local politicians- focus there too!  https://t.co/q3vvCYpL4T<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VallejoPd have been on the radar of MSM and Social media for months, thanks for staying on them on this angle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#2020 Holiday Gift Giving Guide: Books that educate on issues related to  criminal courts, police, lawyers and judges. @JosephTully tops my list. @radleybalko @notguiltyCHI @ScottHech @TracieOlsonPD   @DavisVanguard @thesajidakhan @LeahGillisLaw   https://t.co/TVmZVMhmi0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grace_hase remember when you told me you knew @joesimitian well and I asked if that would prevent you from asking him tough and uncomfortable questions? Are you asking those?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And important to remember that not all moms have that history and those moms had no idea that was going on. Some of us do now. Thank you for speaking up about it. Until we explain what that looks like to children, we can't educate or report on any of it properly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every journalist, editor or publisher who understands this is a gem! We have to report on the judges in our modern courts!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffRosen lodged this " whistleblower" complaint against public defender @thesajidakhan. Then @radleybalko wrote about it.  I was struck by how poorly it was written by a DA with a @UCLA  and @UCBerkeley education. @notguiltyCHI  Here is the link:  https://t.co/GkEjhO1EZ5  https://t.co/NCoWbzjeLe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn't @Mldauber 's husband #KenDauber of Google a Board Member @PaloAltoUnified ? Gee Ken looks like your wife's big effort to recall Persky by rigging the election did nothing for the students in your district !  https://t.co/PFE84dQABM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good for these kids- brining the First Amendment  home!  Should be no bunkering in place to ignore these students. Already ignored thousands of other women and rigged the election to make the public  think Persky was the problem. @paloaltoweekly     https://t.co/PFE84dQABM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joesimitian -  running out of runway after ignoring sexual assault cases and the rigging of the 2018 election. Seems he was only concerned with ONE victim @Jeff_Rosen  used to get re- elected. Where was @mldauber? Oh yea, getting book deals for Emily Doe.  https://t.co/PFE84dQABM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People will complain. Media will distort. Politics will persist.....  It's Simple:  Wear a seat belt.  Wear a helmet.  Wear a mask.  Don't text while driving.  Don't Drink and Drive.  https://t.co/c4IcHKLvDa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was amazing to me that the local press here would not cover family courts. Then learned the local judges engaging in outright fraud were in @sanjoserotary  together and the @SantaClaraDA  was giving them all a free pass on DUIs !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really hope when the election is over..... @ProjectLincoln will focus on local elections where we deal with DAs, Sheriffs and Judges. It is not a political issue, it is human issue and a democracy issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have not researched the nominee- but without my strongest reading glasses I thought for a moment was looking at a scene from #handmaidstale - down to the dress color! Eerie, even when I got my glasses back!  https://t.co/AQ2k4IdG9l<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Smart publishing- photos are password protected . Keep in mind publishers must figure out how to keep in the business of providing information to the public. Even during a global pandemic and presidential election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think we are going to have to do more than pray. That hasn't been working out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pop up solutions without code enforcement or oversight = natural and probable consequences as families and businesses grapple with a lack of information, leadership and overall plan in COVID crisis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EFF  @FACoalition:  without a doubt two of the most important non-profits working for the public on First Amendment issues. From the #eff database- found our little @TownLG  was using this technology- Support these groups with your donations in #2020  https://t.co/iqeBOmpRBS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonLeopold  my public records treasure of the week- @LGMSPolice  did a rapid response on predictive policing records. Surprise was the town was also paying for it for @CampbellPolice -  got any on #Predpol in #FOIA?  https://t.co/iqeBOmpRBS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is interesting to me that outrage only occurs on this issue when it involves the President. We found @SantaClaraDA  @Jeff_Rosen and several judges, all Democrats, doing the same thing. @CA_FPPC  complaint pending- guess we will find out if it does violate the law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saying the names of judges when unfairness in the courts is important, but has to be said more clearly and in context: Who is the judge and why does it matter. Name the county and state if you can. That is how the noise gets louder about our courts and the folks working in them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why it is important to recognize the work of police officers and the dangers involved. They need protection when dealing with crimes- not protests!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In case a DA needs to be convinced of the harm a divorce lawyer imposes on a community, one need only look to @SCCBarAssn newsletters- the association endorsing @Jeff_Rosen for DA. @NancyOMalleyDA1 @chesaboudin @jeffreisig @sanmateoco  https://t.co/Ej6AQpsNxl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For 40 years.  attorney  Baugh told judges , lawyers &amp; clients he served in Vietnam.  Even lied about it in depositions.  Ms. Becton's office pointed out the jurisdiction. @Jeff_Rosen  and @NancyOMalleyDA1  did nothing. SOL for perjury still running.  @cocodefender  @chesaboudin  https://t.co/7gAlPFds1W<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notguiltyCHI - Topic of transcripts- Reporters have a  tough time getting these, much less understanding them. The IOWA judge and forging of orders in divorce cases was exposed by the judge's deposition. Brad Baugh was a divorce attorney. Stolen Valor exposed in his deposition.  https://t.co/hEqImd6yqj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No court reporters in most cases, unless paid with large sums of private money from families. No media reporters, their publishers are in clubs with the judges. Right @pulcrano ?  https://t.co/P8jonHxHxk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Already know @josephtullylaw  @LeahGillisLaw and @TracieOlsonPD @ScottHech paying attention- think of family court as criminal court with no right to a lawyer. @notguiltyCHI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had to do that when I went to Europe for a month out of college. Was a problem when I purchased some Italian sweaters!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To the lawyers, even if only @notguiltyCHI is paying attention:   Judges are supposed to discipline lawyers.   This includes divorce attorneys and prosecutors. Sadly over the past 10 years judges have worried more about being " friends" with the lawyers.  https://t.co/wZwuI3Zirs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The lawyers among us: Seems most of you have no idea what is going on in family court. Here is an IOWA case, this happens in family court thousands of times a day. Most insidious when one side has a lawyer and the other does not.  https://t.co/TbFv3xQCrY  https://t.co/I1J5aVEVkr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, it is amazing how little the public knows about this. Media silence protecting the crooked judges and lawyers. Lots of money!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mldauber  has been subpoenaed for this case. She refused to show and still has a body attachment. She could have done the right thing, instead hung out in Big Bear at her new digs complaining about the tourists and lying about how sick she was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYPD60Pct just want to add, that as this tweet was sent- #NYC announced there had been $250 million paid out in settlements for police misconduct and $900 million owed in deferred payments to teachers could not be made! This is what pisses off the public.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do wonder about all those police reports the prosecutors rely on !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will it be a faux pas  if I just keep re tweeting this?  It really does describe our modern family courts better than I have been able to these past 8 years! @sharonstone pull the support of @Jeff_Rosen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notguiltyCHI  there are lots of things that " should be" - and yes, it is a court of equity. How equitable do you think it is when one party can pay a lawyer $1 mil for a middle class divorce and the other is pro se? #FalconevFyke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavisVanguard  interesting to compare @Jeff_Rosen  and @jeffreisig  social media footprints with @chesaboudin. Then there is Rosen's new " documentary" . Here is what really happened in that election.  https://t.co/HWoCqcgfhn  https://t.co/iuSkm2zdhd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@svdebug wonder why you are not focusing more on the duly elected DA?  https://t.co/A6EsoOjbSh  https://t.co/B70N9gBfhp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LenoreAnderson Wonder if knowing about the emails between @mldauber and @Jeff_Rosen during the Brock Turner prosecution AND Judge Persky recall if you still stand by the decision to be in Rosen's new " documentary"?  https://t.co/A6EsoOjbSh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>" They seem like the nicest people".... really think this defines the insidious culture that has creeped into our courts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayrosen_nyu headlines from NY yesterday?  1. Cops make weed  bust ( looked like one CA weed shop actually)  2. NYC paid $250 million to settle police misconduct lawsuits ( that's all? )  3. NYC won't pay $900 million in deferred payments to teachers.   Really?   @mrodesmi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenKamalaHarris  what happens when you let the rich white guys go and they keep committing the crimes, including election fraud?  https://t.co/REbb5xn8SX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Evan_Low you proud of that documentary for @Jeff_Rosen  now?  https://t.co/0E53HJDQyw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And a river?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@60Minutes  these are the CA prosecutors you promoted with stenographic journalism. These are the emails that show what the @SantaClaraDA  really was doing during a Judge Recall #Persky.  https://t.co/RNDoBWymUn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These cops need a @Netflix and Chill night - argument could be had for defunding the police department of this one tweet alone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In @SCCgov  been doing this for years in family courts, no reporters!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Evan_Low just gotta ask... knowing this now are you proud of your role in @Jeff_Rosen documentary?    https://t.co/HWoCqcgfhn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeff_Rosen wants to be a @netflix  producer more than a prosecutor. He had @SinunuTowery playing herself. Casting call is @GlennCloseNews available for my version? @SantaClaraDA @pulcrano  https://t.co/wdecd2Y46V<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hard to imagine it would fit on one list. Maybe they should make a short list of which cops don't lie in court. One line ought to do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spj_tweets so I joined SPJ a few years back and realize I do not do traditional journalism. Gotta say, for every reporter who gave @mldauber  and @Jeff_Rosen this platform, what do you do now that you know?  https://t.co/kAlVj7aGPZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SCCoSheriff made 1 political donation ever to #lauriesmith, the only @SCCgov public official who called the San Martin Rape victims and who stood up to judges making false arrests of protestors! Would do it again, but would cross off Largent in the memo.  https://t.co/FEoRnP7uUm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SCCgov you want to " Fact Check " me on this one like you did on #TysonGreen?  https://t.co/FEoRnP7uUm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StanfordLaw doesn't this violate some kind of "Ethics" policy for professors? This is defiantly not speech! According to the emails, it appears Ms. Dauber was practicing law without a license!  https://t.co/HWoCqcgfhn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think I have had about enough of @mldauber  trying to " educate" students on anything!  https://t.co/HWoCqcgfhn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once you have the emails - do you see these Tweets differently ?  https://t.co/HWoCqcgfhn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jimbealljr  still support @mldauber  and @Jeff_Rosen  knowing this?  https://t.co/HWoCqcgfhn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today @LGMSPolice  got a little email - let's see if the feds will actually investigate what was going on in Los Gatos from 2012- 2017.  https://t.co/HWoCqcgfhn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FBI one of my commenters asked how much I had to keep doing til the FBI investigated @Jeff_Rosen  and the rigging of the 2018 election. Well?  https://t.co/HWoCqcgfhn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LynnOwe53622654 yes, oversight - thanks for the email  https://t.co/HWoCqcgfhn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gotta Ask: @sharonstone  if you knew this was going on , would you have done that 2016 event?  https://t.co/HWoCqcgfhn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tried my hand at explaining how a judge rigs her own election with a car wash analogy. How did I do? #CindyHenrickson #JeffRosen @SVWomen  https://t.co/FdwLYvwaK2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too! Have noticed hostility and distrust everywhere !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Know it or not we are all impacted by the criminal justice system and the criminal defense lawyers are our new Superheroes.  Shared role with survivor attorneys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Frightening how much you look like him. What a wonderful adopted father you had that supported that relationship! Speaks volumes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If @SFPD  doesn't see this pass, it won't pass in other places in the country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny you should post this now. Heading to SF  next week with some photojournalist to get a police  report and ask for help re:  attacks against some freelancers - thought as a OG for recording the police when you were a PD,  you would appreciate. Hope to finally meet you there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lawyer once told me that parents involved in corrupt family courts are like ants locating grains of sugar. Here's  are to the ants dealing with court appointed lawyers representing their children.  https://t.co/UhmkG4CcFx  https://t.co/5jTrFW2ZVG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I say criminal defense lawyers are the new superheroes, I mean lawyers like this . Close equivalent are the survivor attorneys fighting just as hard. I have a few on speed dial ! @LeahGillisLaw @josephtullylaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yea, heard that one today and wondered if everyone echoing it realized how incredibly stupid they sounded. Reality is it won't be the politicians who fix, or save , the day. The heroes are the business owners trying to stay afloat while everything burns all around them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes,  and real journalism means providing the transparency to assure due process as that is the only way to know it was fair for those charged and the victims. It is a cruel system  with dirty prosecutors, crooked cops and corrupt or complicit judges. A gauntlet that needs you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It probably isn't going to be good !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have busted prosecutors and cops using this app and they are the worst !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's get it read so we can move that around. @NancyOMalleyDA1 - shame on you - there was a tad of hope you would be willing to assure your office complied with @MarsysLawforAll better than @Jeff_Rosen - you killed that hope today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gotta love the criminal defense lawyers- the firefighters running into the courts when everyone else is trying to get out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Eliminating lawyers in family court could fund all that would be needed to fix almost overnight!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CarsonWhite - public defenders-  Superheroes needed to combat a corrupt  court culture.  Shame on @JudgePaulBernal - good job  @jennwadsworth  doing the work to cover the courts. @thesajidakhan @LeahGillisLaw @BrendonWoodsPD  @DavisVanguard @TracieOlsonPD  https://t.co/u5qvP6MRJd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Try to drive down Dwight  Way once a week to be mindful of @SethSmith and the journey you have ahead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sliccardo  been getting favors from @SantaClaraDA for decades - this is the culture @Jeff_Rosen  has created in @SantaClaraCounty. These corrupt @BellarminePrep boys have tainted our courts and local government by design.  https://t.co/u5qvP6MRJd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After seeing what they did to continue another victim statement in @AlamedaCounty , confirms my claim that we can not rely on courts to even function, much less assure justice. So we get it this way. We see you @SethSmith, and his mom @mrodesmi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Justice Delayed: Informed @NancyOMalleyDA1  @ACDefenders  are causing today's victims' statements to be once again delayed, so live stream may not work.  More info when we have it . Thank you to those who reached out to support the reporter waiting to read a victim statement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>not sure about the calling, sure about the landing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somehow this feels like a new low when the @nytimes  does a post that defiantly feels so social media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KillerMartinis  a fellow reporter who was stabbed 14 times will read a victim statement tomorrow - 1:30PM in Alameda County. Please join virtually to lent support! @NancyOMalleyDA1  https://t.co/PBKEZQURGM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1:30 Court Watch=- Thurs. 10/ 8 = Please tune in to  support  victims &amp; their families  who will give  statements in  Sydney Whalen case- who murdered, stabbed &amp; harmed so many. Please turn in to the live stream.  https://t.co/PBKEZQURGM @mrodesmi @NancyOMalleyDA1 @NancySkinnerCA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OfficerByron took a detour through #Berekley  noted the community police and police on bikes - it somehow felt familiar and refreshing! Didn't get my camera out in time. Very out of character!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Treasure from a public records request produced by the @LGMSPolice today. Time to get busy. This is how we report on the police! @UCBerkeley @UCDavisLaw @DavisVanguard  https://t.co/kIps8n1zzw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Judges protect cops in family court!  Most domestic violence cases involving cops are covered up . They are not criminally  prosecuted and their wives often fail in trying to get help in family court unless they have access to enough money to hire the " right " divorce lawyer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NOTE: They listed the initial media coverage. As an old print publisher am mindful this matters. Tell the news stations and newspapers in your community you want to see more information on the police.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And they even listed the media coverage on the initial arrest. Then sadly most drops off. Time to get busy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something we rarely see in #California<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GackleReport have had some reporters, lawyers and crime victims want to support you by calling in for the hearing- please give court phone number and access # , will post here and on my LinkedIn. @NancyOMalleyDA1 doing a better job than @Jeff_Rosen for  crime victims. #hope<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NateGartrell @thomas_peele  @juliasulek Time to be very proud on this one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@josephtullylaw @LeahGillisLaw @BrendonWoodsPD @TracieOlsonPD @radleybalko @ScottHech @greg_doucette - Huge start. Some missing cases.  @SantaClaraPD #TysonGreen for starters @FAC  https://t.co/fIcHcuqkzb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what journalism is all about! Collaborative project with @reveal  #CenterforInvestigativeReporting @UCBerkeley @mercnews - they started the important work on secret lists of police charged with crimes and not fired! @DavisVanguard  https://t.co/fIcHcuqkzb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wish I could bottle the outrage reporters, lawyers and others see in this and have it applied to what they are doing to take children from parents and family court in every community in America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The hearing should be on audio or zoom - can you provide the court call in and access #?  You are a hero and am so very proud of you. @mrodesmi  please listen and support, you all have more in common than you know. It won't undo the harm, but if done right it should feel just.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welcome Officer Justin Milroy, I will look forward to meeting you when Out and About !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Favorite public record find of the morning.  These are police records from  @VTStatePolice  #Bennington. Guess the moral here is car wash owners beware!  https://t.co/M9NDnEbXHP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Livid, we really need to use that word more. Everyone knows a mom who is livid is much more formidable than a mom who is merely outraged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Passed On.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are we getting numb when we should be outraged?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Race and Gender don't matter if the appointee continues in the same culture of reckless disregard of the law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SCCgov @SCSCourt  has a different view on public records, court records and court access. @FACoalition  @ACLU_NorCal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VallejoPd  has been a problem for too long. In need of lots of good journalists and public attention. No community this size should have police departments this problematic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeff_Rosen  this is what it looks like and when you subpoena Google accounts for a misdemeanor  photo case, you may find you bit off more than you can choke down!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NancyOMalleyDA1 - seems like the right thing to do.  We must be mindful of victim's families when these delays occur. 11 years folks, think of what you did for 11 years as they were fighting for this day. #MARSYSLAW  @thomas_peele  https://t.co/y26Jx4dBfT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahh, yes, the #MarkPeterson residue! I did compliment DA  Becton on her public records response today. They got me my records after an initial speed bump with #ScottAlonso<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOL , IMO it was a very bad Kincaid effort- funny you mentioned it. Guess a little humor muffles the outrage which is needed to keep one's sanity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First  records request to any DA office is to see all the records requests made to that office. @NateGartrell  is a badass reporter when it comes to covering the courts, cops and DA in @CCCounty - stay on that @KensingtonPD issue! @josephtullylaw - glad Nate is watching the DA!  https://t.co/upOFkYNqJ6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Favorite Tweet of the Day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Important to check conflicts  a judge may have in your family law case as judges rarely disclose  their social and personal relationships. In domestic violence cases what stock your judge owns matters. #Henrickson @netflix @Apple  https://t.co/mevUSfzerg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In our Quid Pro Quo lesson: Here is Judge Cindy Hendrickson's husband " Dave " donating a painting to WomenSV . Judge Hendrickson was appointed following the Persky recall and seems to have forgotten  a few things in her disclosures. @Jeff_Rosen  bid on the paintings - kick back?  https://t.co/tDvZ8va8QM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Until and unless we start focusing on the white collar crimes police engage in as a matter of routine we won't clean up the culture. Too entitled. Good to see it is working in Davis where there still is a free press !@jeffreisig  better clean up your act!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very excited to hear this. Seems  new kid on the block may change this culture faster than DAs who live in the past protected by the corruption that taints every case in and out of the criminal and family courts. Harms defendants and crime victims alike.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We started investigating the culture #MarkPeterson created in the @CCCounty DA's office 3 years ago. Apparently it is not getting better. People need to understand dirty prosecutor tricks and being lazy about finding the truth is the worst harm a DA can impose on a community!  https://t.co/SJF4XUR7SD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good job @josephtullylaw  this man had to deal with his wife's suicided then a dirty DA who wanted to pin it on him! Shameful.  Nod to @NateGartrell  for staying on the case and trying to inform the public about what our criminal courts have become! @cocodefender take note!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We spend our lives trusting the courts and believing the law.  In family court there is a different reality. Parents are losing their children merely because they are in a divorce. Meanwhile reporters are focusing on the borders, not the reality for families in our communities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllAboutHelp @JamesMclynas Keep speaking up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you for sharing her story and keeping her name in our thoughts! You and @mrodesmi  are the moms who drive my work everyday!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you - we need to get back to local reporting - too much time lost !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Noticed commercials running in support of Prop 25 have Brock Turner pinned as a rapist who could afford bail. This stems from false media reports &amp; @SantaClaraDA trying their cases in the media to incite public support. We all need to be more responsible in our jobs and activism.  https://t.co/HSiSz0QjwV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe he had a fever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just read RBG opinion  in the Shilling case again today. She was right on the law even when we hoped it would be something else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yea- where is the Kool-Aid!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cusco_the Want to join our stakeouts ? We offer plenty of naps and could use help herding folks in for interviews!  https://t.co/wiPMRymwIJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just clocked 400 lawyers interviewed/ investigated.....  Journalists interviewing lawyers is like a gunfight in the Wild West.  Admittedly I usually get my answers before they have time to find their holster! Grateful for my camera guys- they drive a mean get away wagon!  https://t.co/0TttU3zNJm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well the cooking looked good enough to make me feel guilty !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VirginiaScharff Wait you are hiding the bakery items - I see the receipt - show us the goods and don't pull out a baking dish and slap some flour on your face!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He said the magic words, the secret most lawyers don't know about ..... @bellingcat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What would you suggest as a solution for the police association - prosecutor problem?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice reporting guys - @radleybalko you forgot the secret service on your Friday list!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was a great watch. Remember folks to apply this in your community. It is not just an international problem and public corruption trickles down to journalists who try to report on it. Even in America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomFitton - if they could do it in the 2018 election to recall a judge, imagine what they will do because they were never held accountable. @CA_FPPC   has part- fraud and other claims under he jurisdiction of CA AG who has already given this DA a free pass when #Harris was in.  https://t.co/63VG70L6m9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Journalists often throw words around that we may not fully understand. This is a chapter in a Public Corruption book that explains Quid Pro Quo pretty well. Attributions Peter Henning and Lee Raden.  https://t.co/M9HZFZ0qte<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love that you understand  the value of this for defendants and crime victims!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pulcrano for your birthday weekend here is a little "journalism" gift to remind you how we investigate public officials. Namely elected DAs - Gee Dan, what do you think old @Jeff_Rosen calendars will show for 2018? Meaning just before his re- election and the Persky Recall.  https://t.co/iMXObHdNhX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe it is just me, but I don't think a male publisher has any business chiming in on on the struggles any mom or dad has with a teen.  In 10 years when your daughter is this old, let's see how you are doing. People who live in glass houses and all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone know about the kid and the test?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pulcrano when you claim to be a journalist, remember what it means to hold public officials accountable.  Know your form 700 from a 460. Give reporters the resources they need to do their job before you worry about paying dues for the @sanjoserotary to get "leaks".  @CA_FPPC  https://t.co/PLHA0glIba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unlike @StateBarCA and criminal complaints that are confidential, sworn complaints to the @CA_FPPC  are public records. Any reporter covering the #2020 elections needs to know how to investigate past elections. Right @mldauber and @Jeff_Rosen @pulcrano ?  https://t.co/1vmTjetdku<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#VicariousLiability<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are auditing the bar a new way this year- tracking the complaints as they are investigated. Attention on prosecutors who violate @CA_FPPC  rules and family law attorneys engaging in fraud with impunity from local DA's. It is a circle of corruption that needs transparency !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More important for police reform than folks know. Very important for reporters to get this info out to assure public participation!   @NateGartrell @thomas_peele @jennwadsworth @radleybalko @robertsalonga @josephtullylaw @FACoalition @ACLU_NorCal @ACLU_SoCal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you @chesaboudin - super important to get this out and you have to make it easy for folks to do! @svdebug  @LeahGillisLaw @DavisVanguard @JoaquinValley @BrendonWoodsPD @TracieOlsonPD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just WOW- I haven't been around my kids without a mask.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you for doing this job. Most of their stories end up on our editing floors but for those of us who hear them first hand, they are forever burned in our brains!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can only imagine the fraud we will find in 2020 alone. So much work so few public records!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Support work of journalists at home in his name too. These days covering America feels just as dangerous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you @bjwinnerdavis  nice to find you on Twitter- thank you for sharing the story of your daughter and the impact her prosecution has had on your family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SmallPox<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephenfhayes @EricSchultz Excellent point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These are the voices #BLM needs to hear. Protesting on the streets will be in vain if you don't use other First Amendment protections and see it through!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Need to explain it even more simply to folks who want to be proactive when it comes to reforms, but who don't know how.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrendonWoodsPD You are absolutely the man! 10,613 is an administrative process that requires input from a DA, PD, local bar and city attorney. Also must be circulated to publishers within 100 miles who ask. I am asking. @DavisVanguard  ask for oversight of @jeffreisig and local rules there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeahGillisLaw  this is what the law requires for adoption of a local rule. It does not go through the legislature , and is not part of the Penal Code. However, @SantaClaraDA  has weaponized this process to prosecute journalists investigating his office and political campaigns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You are a hero and always appreciate you taking us on your get-back- on - the- horse- journey. Pushing through these days is harder than most people know. Maybe the cat isn't evil, think of the cat as the  editor pushing you past writer's block!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@radleybalko So we need to report on them in our communities. Reverse Streisand effect!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very important to think about the collateral damage. Most of the folks forced to work and  exposed won't have health care, care for kids forced to do schooling from home, or food and rent if they can't work because they fall sick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pointing these facts out is important!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Godspeed to all dealing with COVID , no matter your side of the political aisle. Our children and our families all have the same worries and fears. Few of them will care what our politics were in the end. Hope your family is safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fact Check please - has he ever used "Love" in a tweet? @ChrisCuomo taught us what it is like to get, and live through the virus. Nights reportedly are the worse. Fever. Delusions. Etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So much of our free press resources  have been  focused on Trump these past 4 years that little has been left to cover local elections. Remember if voters elect cheaters on the Water Board, those cheaters may evolve to become President someday. @CA_FPPC  https://t.co/ullnLKg6fH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SantaClaraDA announced he starting to prosecute violent crimes. What was he prosecuting before? Also said 2/3 of the criminal courts are now open. What he didn't say is how many people falsely arrested are sitting in jail and will die before they get to court!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what humanity is supposed to look like, No cops, no fire, just all these people working together to do the right thing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottHech Read a long form article you aren't really interested in but have to read!  Or watch one of my videos !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pulcrano investigative reporting doesn't  mean waiting for the leak- or source you buy off at @sanjoserotary . Got @CA_FPPC  records back in 2018. Lookie there  on @Jeff_Rosen disclosures Mr. Scumb,  big conspiracy bribery case Rosen hopes will deflect what he did in 2018.  https://t.co/1SQBQ3qKOH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is why we get the police reports and investigate him on that end. It is the stuff we can't see that matters most.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Karma some are calling it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Divorce attorney to client:  You will  do less time in jail if you  killed your wife than if you go to family court to divorce her. Apparently a legal strategy that puts divorce lawyers out of business and criminal defense lawyers in short supply.  https://t.co/jw89qrfIck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let the imagining begin! This makes lots of work for reporters- so far haven't seen anyone on the #falsepostive narrative.  https://t.co/48eHYoH5qJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine there are going to be lots of folks in crisis in the months to come!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenJamesUS told ya<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Read #DarwinAwards to kids so they wouldn't die doing stupid sh*t . Now I read  police reports and public records so kids don't die from stupid cops. Think school newspapers are free press?  See exchange between @LGMSPolice and  @LosGatosHigh #KristyGratsy  https://t.co/hUXU4k9yRY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pulcrano  guess I was right- Silicon Valley is the swamp- the lawyers are the crocodiles but publishers like Dan Pulcrano give them the water to kill in. Dan got the Dauber emails:  https://t.co/ROYi8moDAo        Gave Dauber and @Jeff_Rosen  media immunity and free ink instead.  https://t.co/93WOU3n9XJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pulcrano  know about defamation laws? How about publishing,  as fact,  that someone is a rapist, when conviction was for sexual assault?  When  @SantaClaraDA   @Jeff_Rosen  create a false narrative ,  and publishers don't correct it = loss of public trust in journalism.  https://t.co/BPsldqijIz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@propublica @EFF @FACoalition @ACLU- when you only have $4 bucks left, each of these should get $1 ...because you are already screwed but without a free press you are f*cked.   @StephenJamesUS @thomas_peele @NateGartrell @josephtullylaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>EU  is always ahead of the game on these issues. This is Silicon Valley's worst nightmare.  Social media  platforms have become weaponized and their publishers the new titans  where speech issues are concerned. As always @Eff is ahead of the curve on this one. - Thank you !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really do not know why more reporters are not asking for and reading the emails! Why was Larry Pott name dropping @Jeff_Rosen - did he get something other victims don't from @SantaClaraDA ? @LeahGillisLaw  https://t.co/iTQy25DlER<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One Lie: Suicide of Audrie Pott was addressed by the police, prosecutors and schools. Focus was on 'cyberbullying" and millions of public funds were spent. The real issues, domestic violence and fraud in a divorce case, never mentioned.  https://t.co/gz9t18Jv0H<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A photo of @realDonaldTrump is a shameless grab at attention spillover from a national election. It isn't masks you need to be worried about , it is the culture in the @SanJosePD - Why is Jared Yuen still there? @sliccardo @Jeff_Rosen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beautiful part about investigating public corruption? These folks are not as bright as they pretend to be in their political campaigns. So when you look back their patterns make them easier to catch. This is why local journalism matters!  https://t.co/1ZeHk8um7F<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone ever wonder why more divorce lawyers aren't sued for malpractice? This is a case where the lawyer duped his client into private judging, Sh*t is about to get real. Will Mark Erickson spoil the private judge scam for everyone?  https://t.co/jLneuhCslf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey Sam how about stick to your problems here instead of jumping on national election stuff - don't you have enough cops shooting testicles off protestors to be worrying about ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait, you didn't fight the recall, you gave the recall public resources and hedged your bets with the lawyers and judges . Gonna start fact checking you @Jeff_Rosen - bigger job than fact checking @realDonaldTrump  or @SenKamalaHarris #DauberEmails<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sharonstone - know what it feels like when you investigate a corrupt DA who ignored rape victims then realize  he is more  idiot than scary? Seems @Jeffrosen  was in  a rush to get aligned with you, but forgot to clear the Latin template off his website ! You should do a DCA.  https://t.co/ge6OwV819i<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just what does it mean when the @SantaClaraDA  PIO gets a restraining order. My favorite is how they were scrambling after this indigent man opposing the recall was willing to take on @Jeff_Rosen  https://t.co/GBjUY4F2eO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Smart, but the entire thing was a disaster. An embarrassment for America. Gotta say we need a mom to moderate, that was a botch tonight! Anyone with experience with a toddler could have done better!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahhh the Media Policy - should be the first public record requested of any law enforcement agency , DA's office or local government. Very telling.  https://t.co/4AjiiXc6l0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Media resources need to be spent covering our local elections or fraud and patterns of public corruption will persist. Oh hey @Jeff_Rosen - forget something? Hint, it wasn't the @SCCoSheriff  office that was corrupting the 2018 elections!  https://t.co/zqoB71dIOC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can you imagine him responding to a DV or rape call, for several of my sources they don't have to imagine. He seems to be teamed up with #DDAMeeker in @SantaClaraDA . Study the prosecutors and how they protect these dirty cops. We need the good ones to speak up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, we know how to deal with bickering children. Sad this is a presidential debate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, the FAA community has seen serious retaliation from police and journalists who discredit their work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can never thank you all enough for the help you give us all at #IRE each year!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can @SantaClaraDA explain why #TerryHarman delivered records to @mldauber -PUBLIC RECORDS EXPRESS-  rest of us had to go through #DavidAngel? I'll take my answer online.  https://t.co/x3lBTJUOrr  @DavisVanguard @LeahGillisLaw @thesajidakhan @radleybalko @NateGartrell @thomas_peele  https://t.co/oizm8jF0yZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Election Fraud, gotta go back to 2018 - #DauberEmails with @Jeff_Rosen Just SHAMEFUL public corruption. Want to read the first section of the 6000?  https://t.co/ROYi8moDAo  This one from @mldauber  shows someone a little insecure and learning how to manipulate the media.  https://t.co/Q8q3v1jDGH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>" Dear Friends" Your DA is being investigated for public corruption. He has informal policies to keep his political adversaries away , but then lines up with lawyers he is prosecuting .... NOT SO "SMART" @Jeff_Rosen @SantaClaraDA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amazing work @CNN  - now we have to ask, in addition to lying about Body Cams, why would cops doing a NO KNOCK WARRANT not have bodycams on????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They do it all the time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Important to see what the fires actually did- thanks for giving us eyes on @SCCoSheriff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey as much as I am calling out the bad cops in @SCCgov , I also will point to good cops who do work hard, are honest and put their lives on the line to keep us safe. Love when you guys give attributions for the assists too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is it government lawyers are always running to court , until they are the ones being called?  Then it is quash. quash. quash.  @LeahGillisLaw @BrendonWoodsPD @TracieOlsonPD @ScottHech @DavisVanguard  https://t.co/5Nzqujz9L1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Police and Government Lawyers- Have we reached a tipping point? Few people know that county and city employees get lawyers for work related and personal related incompetence that harms others. It is a risk management tool. Right @SCCgov @SantaClaraDA ?  https://t.co/JI8mefH82W<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOOK:  #views @JeffRosen is pulling on his  YouTube videos.  @SantaClaraDA and @SCCgov   allows Rosen to pay $5-10K on videos with #SeanWebby acting as producer. IMO very poor ROI! @jennwadsworth @thomas_peele @NateGartrell @StephenStockTV  @DavisVanguard @pulcrano  https://t.co/DiA6e047XM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be CLEAR: You do not want the district attorney involved in any " parent project" . They have a horrible track record when it comes to permanent harm to children. KEEP THEM AWAY FROM YOUR CHILDREN - #CARLOSVEGA #KASEYHALCON #TERRYHARMAN #JIMDEMERTZIS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Covering the elections this season?  Don't just look at the 460 financial disclosures.

<|startoftext|>Publishers must be willing to cover the courts. From police on the streets to prosecutors in court-  issues related to anger and mental health issues will only increase in our communities in the months to come. Using public resources in this manner is no longer responsible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unless @Jeff_Rosen pulls a code enforcement order like he did on businesses in @TownLG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who is connected to the local @SantaClaraDA ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's see if #ruthpatrick and #womenSV will help this domestic violence victim. @Jeff_Rosen @SantaClaraDA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gotta dig beyond the cops to the prosecutors, judges and lawyers protecting the cops and bad policing. #GloriaHejna - many linked to #RuthPatrick and #WomenSV, @LosAltosVillage helped fund. Be  open to investigating your friends and colleagues .   https://t.co/1egrueejAM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Judges are supposed to disclose their social, personal and financial relationships. Can safely say they NEVER do. So we dig. @sanjoserotary  really should watch the lawyers and publishers you let in to your club these days. @JeffRosen  @DanPulcrano  https://t.co/1egrueejAM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Important we realize " defunding" is being misused. If public funds went into training, educations , community policing and eliminating waste abusive cops bring - problems would be resolved quickly. Screening is also critical. We need to catch them before they are cops.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The silent crisis we have yet to imagine is lurking in our unaddressed mental health issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chesaboudin  are prosecutors supposed to drag criminal cases out 4 years and tell the victims they got " in bed " with co- conspirators?  https://t.co/9ZVJeleIrN @NateGartrell @thomas_peele<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @Jeff_Rosen  are your prosecutors #AdmirAlem supposed to call up victims and tell them you guys got in bed with some co- conspirators?  @cocodefender @robertsalonga  https://t.co/9ZVJeleIrN<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If a reporter does not know a deposition from an ex parte, a publisher hasn't done the training that needs to be done to cover our courts.  https://t.co/h2SI1u9iyR @BrendonWoodsPD @radleybalko<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pulcrano getting  @SantaClaraDA to  "leak "  a grand jury transcript is not journalism. Getting a recording of a prosecutor telling the DA's dirty little secrets is. @LeahGillisLaw @NateGartrell  @josephtullylaw   https://t.co/h2SI1u9iyR<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Jennifer Higgins Bradanini killed a 66-year-old man with her car while on medication and was reportedly texting. She is being criminally prosecuted by @SantaClaraDA .

<|startoftext|>@SVWomen:  non- profit in @LosAltosVillage  run by #RuthPatrick. She takes money from local government and private donations. Publishers give her traction.  Victims are finally speaking out but most local media helps protect the system @pulcrano @LosAltosChamber<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you saw it. Sadly this is done everyday by a person in control of family money or local connections. Am flooded with calls from ex spouses of cops. Many terrified to ask for help because they know this is what it will look like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reporters: To understand racism in the courts better learn how to do public records requests on the DA's office. This is @SCCgov - the heart of Silicon Valley where apparently white guys don't resist arrest so much. @BrendonWoodsPD @ScottHech @radleybalko @josephtullylaw  https://t.co/kHoCCXOXW9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fact Checking @SantaClaraDA who said he would drop stand alone resisting arrest charges, which are commonly charged to coverup police misconduct.

<|startoftext|>Thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SantaClaraDA  took Brock Turner directly to trial when he had a media mob to support a conviction. In cases they don't really want to own, they send those to the Grand Jury. There they direct what the grand jury sees.  #CCW case  #McDonald case.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pulcrano  no transcript is " leaked " unless a DA wants it leaked to try a case in the media. Listen to the words in the #BreonnaTaylor  case. Publishers who play the game with corrupt DAs are on the losing side of public trust !  https://t.co/JQ6HH8rwVD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got police reports in two botched rape and domestic violence cases from 2017. Guess who was the  @SanJosePD   in all of those cases?

<|startoftext|>Hmmm seems  @Jeff_Rosen is more weary from  bunking in place and protecting his political campaigns. Sounds like not busy worrying about helping any family other than the ones donating to his campaigns!  https://t.co/3PfR6JKIkt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny @SantaClaraDA  retweeted this. @Jeff_Rosen  no post about your " private " Zoom talk with Ruth Patrick? That's okay we got the recording and since taxpayers were paying you to make those comments we will get it out!  https://t.co/SluqU3CT7I<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That happened to me in CA too. Broke one camera and a mic. Frustrating. Be safe!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Smart<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If more people did this instead of donating to political campaigns, things might look brighter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you @NateGartrell  you always do a teriffic job watchdogging the courts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quite a trick- presentation at #IRE20 being pre- recorded makes us all believe you were traveling, prepping and getting camera ready when  you were playing at home! Thank you for your help today, As always very useful especially for those still fighting for local journalism !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amen. But as a publisher , it is also my duty to make sure journalists, photographers, editors and even ad sales folks are paid a fair wage so they will want to stay. Sadly this in in conflict with VC models that are running most newsrooms these days.<|endoftext|>

Reminded me:  All reporters are biased in some way going into a story. Good ones come out recognizing what those biases were.  https://t.co/VLQc0OrPRX<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Having worked in organic farming for 20 years I would say this. Focus in your own carbon footprint. Eat in season. Buy local. But only what you need. Pre- cycle:  don't buy products with excessive packaging- it is a mindset and a lifestyle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really important to keep events going in our local communities. This is creative- thank you for sharing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laurenepowell anyone who supported #WomenSV should be informed as to what what donors and victims are reporting about  @Jeff_Rosen  and his political campaigns. Please support local journalists bringing transparency and accountability to your community.  @MarsysLaw  https://t.co/mYTv15hx8a<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today @Jeff_Rosen gave a talk to rich women  battered, raped and abused. @SantaClaraDA   has had no time for poor women who are raped, battered and abused. Think about how socioeconomic and race issues impact the other side of the criminal courts! @LeahGillisLaw  @josephtullylaw  https://t.co/pVrkXMxNU0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonanFarrow  thank you for your local news rally call and for the shout out to @KillerMartinis  - we think of her in all we do. You can get released from jail, she is having to live without her eye. You both inspire us when lockdown doesn't look like a home and garden show!  https://t.co/ET9JM8t2yy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Good! But you should be at #IRE2020, not reading mail! We all need to kick ass in our reporting on elections, covid , and cops in the months to come!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnMRavel was paid by @Maplight and Now @Jeff_Rosen  is endorsing Ravel for State Senate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlamedaCounty  has non-profit #WomenSV on its vendor list.

<|startoftext|>@CityofLosAltos  donated $15,000 for victims of domestic violence @WomenSV.  Most victims never got services.  complaints allege Ruth Patrick of #WomenSV  used the non- profit largely to recruit business for board member Jim Hoover's law firm and divorce attorney Nicole Ford.  https://t.co/SOj6AKXglE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sliccardo  a few YouTube videos of @SJPD_PIO  cops ( and not the ones @Jeff_Rosen  paid $5 K in public funds to produce), would train them all cops better than your big $43 million training center. Frankly @sjpdchief sucked at training.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking for anyone who donated to or tried to get help from @LosAltosChamber based WomenSV.

<|startoftext|>@SantaClaraDA  @Jeff_Rosen  this is what journalism looks like! You should be very worried......@jeffreisig  you can watch, best to know what is coming your way! @DavisVanguard @TracieOlsonPD @LeahGillisLaw @thesajidakhan  https://t.co/CQicZJ5xdG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeff_Rosen   thinks he is in the clear- NOPE. A  leaked recording of Admir Alem tainting a case is being sent to Mr. Schumb's lawyers for comment. I am just staying ahead. #IRE was virtual this year, so have afternoon free . @pulcrano that is what journalism looks like!  https://t.co/jlxSHB6GCz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or about their spouses during a divorce !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gunita_singh : 10 am IRE virtual 2020  quote  - " The federal government did not modify FOIA during COVID" - reminding us to not stop because of obstacles public officials will try to throw in the way of our newsgathering activities. These same officials still getting paid.  https://t.co/BQZQZjC3ym<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And reporters - very helpful at IRE right now on DOD and #FOIA requests !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That may be one of the best photos I have ever seen- vanishing point - texture and interest.  Now will go read but had to pause on this photo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is how a DA tries his cases in the media for a political advantage and how the public loses trust in local government and local press.  Follows a pattern and the media is  complicit or assisting. #AudriePott #ChanelMiller Time for re- election-  here @Jeff_Rosen goes again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why public lost trust in a free press:  @SantaClaraDA  @Jeff_Rosen   ignored hundreds of crime victims and used his  office for pollical purposes. Start asking why they are more worried about CCWs than cops shooting protestors or public corruption in the courts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Setting up for #IRE and bought this $20 speaker to better hear this year's virtual conference. Look what was on the sticker! @IRE_NICAR  https://t.co/V4MCP4eWJr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They ask me to call them Jane or John Q. They are terrified but angry. These families were stuck in @SCCgov  family courts for 30 years where no reporter was listening. Lawyers and elected officials knew what was happening and to these families and yet did nothing. I'm listening.  https://t.co/VNRkkSGAFr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ACLU_VT We are getting lots of complaints about this FB page blocking users and now taking page down.  https://t.co/1GiLoG2otW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would should be asking this specifically to prosecutors and judges who knew, and did it anyway. Think they call it reckless disregard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ongoing Publisher War:  Our research team found out @pulcrano may have been a trucker before he became the largest newspaper and magazine publisher in the Bay Area and started not reporting on the local @SantaClaraDA  as he should!  https://t.co/Zpos7T80G0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does it seem odd that we are still more worried about being recorded in public than what the cops are doing these days?  @TownLG  @SantaClaraDA  @jayrosen_nyu @NYTimesAtWar @mercnews @JoaquinValley    https://t.co/VtmUgWkZem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SCCgov So maybe government employees shouldn't be fact checking journalists! Just saying seems #TysonGreen is running county code enforcement like he did a chop shop while he was @SantaClaraPD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now will do #CPRA for the call for service- apparently there are folks who do not get it and they are not all white !  https://t.co/pwjBsWhcv3  @LosGatosRotary @TownLG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>During an interview a man in his 70s asked me - how is it that lawyers and judges can just openly associate when  those lawyers have cases before the judges. Inns of Court is a problem. @SantaClaraDA #JayBoyarsky  wanted to be a judge but couldn't so fence hanging til he's in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since I began reporting on family court cases, I have established one rule:  Every time I hear ANYONE say " They can't do that!" . You owe me a Quarter.  #Inherentauthority of the court.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And apply it locally. Not just what Trump does to lie , but every duly elected official in every community. If they can't get SART testing correct- what makes you think they can do it better on COVID ?  https://t.co/Z92quOpxsY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still waiting for response on where that $600K went that was supposed to help rape victims.

<|startoftext|>All she wanted was her smile back.   @Jeff_Rosen couldn't even give her that.   He was too busy with  @Mldauber. @LeahGillisLaw  @GackleReport @Ash_Kalra  https://t.co/qYEI7KsuEI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Judge Geffon  doubling down. Knows of the conflicts and he is one of them.  Follow the history !! Geffon hired by @49ers  to silence rape &amp; DV victims- then  minors in the #AudriePott case. Anyone  think that is relevant? @LeahGillisLaw @radleybalko @DavisVanguard @pulcrano  https://t.co/zlrJVeaIE6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let the cronyism games begin. Rosen has spent 10 years building equity in that court. Glad our local media is finally watching him - hopefully you are not done pressing to get the other side of this decision! @DavisVanguard @StephenStockTV @pulcrano @mercnewsguild @mercnews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this is what it looks like when you earn one instead of buying one!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>They can support anything they want, they should be fixing the rigging that went on in 2018 first or it won't matter who gets to vote !  https://t.co/RNDoBWgM2P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually @SCCgov is also threatening homeowners with fines and property seizures #TysonGreen #WardPenfold too- while libraries are closed, schools are onlilne and Politicians sit in their comfy homes with gold plated health care and pensions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait ! You think you are an expert on a " pathway to success" ? What about that $600K you promised rape victims? The public can see when you are just making it up out of your a** while collecting  your paycheck, pension and gold plated health care!  https://t.co/xLnM7lVNEF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nearly bankrupted @SCCBarAssn used divorce lawyer Brad Baugh to draft their family law newsletters and endorse @Jeff_Rosen  for @SantaClaraDA - #WhoKnew? Every lawyer who was silent  https://t.co/3yWSZGF1ee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They do that in the UK- in @SCSCourt  it would never work because it is super rigged and corrupt. Most people have no idea how cronyism infects courts and taints trials.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pulcrano  want me to teach you how to do social media research on @Jeff_Rosen ? 1 read court files 2. See photos of  donor's families on political social media accounts 3. Read the 460 Forms 4.  Pull up your #IRE materials and remember what it means to be a reporter  https://t.co/k3A2Vyo9T9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeff_Rosen  misused government resources then  spent more time making sure he hit all the groups in his " donor" base  than he spent  protecting crime victims or following the law- @thesajidakhan  @LeahGillisLaw @BrendonWoodsPD @chesaboudin  https://t.co/S7cwxE8zAS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Open Source: Interns &amp; Citizen Journalists are filling in the gaps for independent publishers on the front lines of our free press. Thanks the folks  who rock my social media investigations that back up  #CPRAs @DavisVanguard coming for @jeffreisig when done with @Jeff_Rosen  https://t.co/VUkkMyLMkB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pulcrano  when a publisher brags about having a #PulitzerPrize because he bought out a failing paper that had earned one, it kind of feels like a college cheating scandal. IMO - better to earn one than to buy one.  https://t.co/MtyB4bwqdv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes - more than the ballot box- @NateGartrell  gotta dig deeper and look at the DA races - @JeffRosen rigged @SCCgov - @pulcrano  @robertsalonga - you got nothing on that ?  https://t.co/RNDoBWgM2P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>$1 million missing from @Jeff_Rosen 460 Forms - and @SupCindyChavez where is that $600K you promised rape victims two years ago- they are still waiting ! @SusanEllenberg @DaveCortese @Mike__Wasserman  @joesimitian  https://t.co/B57T1Juaf4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely !!! @josephtullylaw  @RobinYeamans @DeAnnSalcido and of course the master- @JohnGrisham - but some start out lawyers and become journalists to explain how broken our legal systems are !<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If Cops are Complicit - What are lawyers and judges who watch one of their own draft this evil and celebrate it  with an award? @pulcrano  who did you hire for your first custody case?

<|startoftext|>Guess what the cops wives are saying these days?  https://t.co/fMK88CDBV5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guess what the wives say about the cops in the divorce papers? The best sources on police misconduct and guess who has a monopoly ?  https://t.co/NeFZ7WEeE8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Knew I adored you ! Almost ready for a road trip- maybe we can do a tour!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope- this doesn't fix it, unless @SCCgov is giving out free phones and computers- #socioeconomic bias! By the way- this is the highest viewed Tweet- the county is definitely overpaying social media employees - bad ROI on that one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whoops - there goes the big endorsement @Jeff_Rosen - @SCCBarAssn going bankrupt - giving up lease.  Where will judges get their next free lunch ? @sanjoserotary @StateBarCA  https://t.co/GXFjlrtqQS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SCCgov @SantaClaraDA  Here is your Streisand Effect Lesson # 1  https://t.co/vYCDev6CyD.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it: Think like a Lawyer Act like a Journalist   OR  Think like a Journalist act like a Lawyer?    Just know I am a super bad lawyer - but know some good ones!  @josephtullylaw @LeahGillisLaw @TracieOlsonPD  @greg_doucette<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My hero publisher! There aren't many independent publishers left so when you find one, hug them - donate and support them. @DavisVanguard  started a new venture on my old stopping grounds at @ucdavis - where I started in farming and publishing. Hopefully not #Darwin project!  https://t.co/GATEsNJvhr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think: Kids in K - first year of college, all are harmed in #2020 - hopefully they will be resilient and be pros at improv for the rest of their lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chesaboudin - Tough on White Collar crime vs. petty prosecutions against the poor and socioeconomically disadvantaged has more merit for reform. Prosecutors have to be  willing to go after a @Google executive with more  than a kid stealing a book to read.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greg_doucette is absolutely my favorite on @Twitter !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just remember " news" is defined by the business of the free press- make sure you get balance there too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pass it on to every civil rights lawyer and elected official - then investigate the conflicts in your community. @CivRightsVoices<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Civil Rights lawyers looking at police: Remember the Government Code!!! Conflicts are the invisible threads of corruption. @SCCgov  #TysonGreen #WardPenfold  https://t.co/ge3RhhAsli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yea! An old Cal Aggie gal supports you all the way!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It amazes me how naïve most people are about Silicon Valley. Chang doesn't even come close- try covering what these folks are doing in their divorce cases!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Such a Bro comment!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you - I really hope people are sharing the work these citizen journalist as doing when it comes to covering the police and public officials.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have video of a Chaplin out there recording everything for the @SJPD- welcome @jennwadsworth  you are now experiencing the world of copsplaining - @sjpdchief  been doing it for years to  duck discipline and lawsuits. #TysonGreen @SantaClaraPD #Gomez #Winslow @SCCoSheriff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatieHill4CA  welcome to divorce  attorneys who do this all the time. When caught it is not their fault , it is a mistake, or fault belongs elsewhere. This is a culture. It is going on everywhere- we have been complicit - this is the wake up call. Not just @MichealCohen11<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BatBin now blocked - no room for that in #2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@latimes #2020 should be the year you report on prosecutor races differently. Look at the timing and @GeorgeGascon and @JackieLaceyDA too -what are their records on cops and who is donating to them and why? Think what would #DAKaren do- @Jeff_Rosen  https://t.co/kz0MDRzKlx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These folks on YouTube were discredited and ignored by mainstream media for years. Then the video of George Floyd woke some reporters up. @justinpulliam  one of my favorite public records and court reporters down in Texas. @TexasTribune @propublica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How about in @SCCgov  a cop got prosecuted for running a chop shop. And after conviction, while on felony probation, the county hired him to be a code enforcer where he is reportedly unlawfully helping the county seize property. #TysonGreen  https://t.co/QfOG2XE67S<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>" Nobody will believe you " the calling card of police, judges, lawyers and the most powerful !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You got three- can't fix stupid - you are either married to an abusive cop or are one yourself. It is a mindset that isn't likely to come up with good solutions .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Didn't  just the 4 who sat on Floyd's neck, the hundreds who knocked over and old man and stepped on him as he bled from his head and the 9 cops on the LA Journalist- clearly overpaid and lacking in de-escalation training. Aren't you lumping all protestors together?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am still working- not forgotten!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Easy for a prosecutor to check if someone has a history of being a journalist - but a cop on the street needs to treat press and  public the same, unless and except there is a federal order. Anyone who thinks one link is the answer, is an idiot.  https://t.co/eCs9yD7D9a<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When cops treat reporters like this , they are inciting a culture that is unacceptable. Reporters don't just cover press conferences and no reporter I know would withhold evidence of a crime. But I know a lotta prosecutors who won't listen to evidence reporters have on cops.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>2002: Divorce lawyers tell clients to use private judges claiming it will  be faster, cheaper,  less costly and more private  than  public court. They lied.

<|startoftext|>Yea if @JoeBiden said that he saw it the way @mldauber wrote it but he didn't see all the other rape and sexual assault victims @Jeff_Rosen  and the @SantaClaraDA  never bothered to help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is Audrie Pott, she died from suicide on 9/12/2012. Her real father was never interviewed by any reporter, @juliasulek , @SantaClaraDA  or @SCCoSheriff. Her mother and step father got $3 million from a civil settlement and $10 mil from a @netflix deal to make #AUDRIEANDDAISY  https://t.co/gZYng6UhOl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For 8 years we  listened to the @SantaClaraDA  @juliasulek  tell their version of how a little girl known as Audrie Pott came to commit suicide. Now it is my turn.

<|startoftext|>Well I grew up in Berkeley , went to @ucdavis  and married a farmer from the Salinas Valley. So how do you think that fits your theory?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Agree , but cameras are the black mirror to the conduct. Hard to change a culture that can't be seen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Public Record Outrage: @SantaClaraDA #KaseyHalcon and @Jeff_Rosen told a rape victim she could only get a $250 cash card  and a DV victim they had no money to help her in family court- turns out they had the money from taxpayers to make their own @sundancefest - @netflix trailer.  https://t.co/ssBGi5JLSX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So outraged going to keep pinning until more are outraged too    @Jeff_Rosen  paid $5000 per video he produced on the @SCCgov YouTube channel. His highest views were 1,200.

<|startoftext|>Really not sure America is much better, they just hide their stats and truth better!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SantaClaraDA @Jeff_Rosen  used his office as a marketing machine to stay  in office.

<|startoftext|>@SantaClaraDA  told a rape victim they could only give her a $250 cash card  as the DAO was paying $5k to produce this video on YouTube.  The video has only 1.2 K views.

<|startoftext|>Apparently @SantaClaraDA  @Jeff_Rosen  wanted to be a movie star, or a @netflix  star , more than he wanted to do his job as a prosecutor.

<|startoftext|>Clearly @SCCgov is overfunding the DAO and underfunding education. The district attorney and courts should not be anywhere near families navigating education, safety and mental health issues in a pandemic . This is outrageous overreaching  when our public libraries are closed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Welcome to the club!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SCCgov -  first tried to discredit my reporting on Tyson Green. Got past that. But how did he get past County Counsel and the HR manual?

<|startoftext|>An LA TV anchor got me an internship to cover the 1984 DNC- she was fired shortly thereafter for being too fat for tv. Not that long ago folks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never imagined 1 million people would want to know about the courts  and  public records from @SCCgov.

<|startoftext|>@CA_FPPC  remember the Alamo, or @ContraCostaDA  Mark Peterson anyway. Because @SantaClaraDA  is next up to bat.   @Jeff_Rosen  and his top prosecutors used government emails and public resources like their political piggy banks !      https://t.co/NFgQvacdrW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With calls to defund police and YouTube videos giving millions of reasons to believe there are only bad cops, it is important to remember why we need them. Now we have to ask why was this person out of jail!  https://t.co/fLd6XoEEae<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you for sharing that. Remember , Epstein had all the money in the world and never paid for one of those calls!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A teacher at @LosGatosHigh once said she thought there was more autism in #SiliconValley than anywhere else, assure you - teachers, cops, politicians, prosecutors, judges and even doctors have no idea how we deal with mental health issues. It is a simmering crisis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every teacher, parent, mother , lawyer and reporter better spend as much time learning about this as they do learning how to order a @Starbucks    https://t.co/aR6ltKcaZf<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What do you think when you see these signs on businesses? @TownLG  https://t.co/ynXwA34SB8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And if you don't make sure she does those assignments, and you live in @SCCgov  @SantaClaraDA  now has permission to prosecute you in the local family courts, that cost $283 million to build.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We need video of that- that is amazing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not about passing more laws. Time to address the education &amp; mental health issues we have ignored for  20 years as we treated corrupt prosecutors, judges and cops better than teachers, nurses, doctors, fire fighters, dads, moms and grandmothers. The children have been watching.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, it is the prosecutors- they have become complicit , incompetent and corrupt. And the DA's we elect have used their public offices as PR platforms rather than in any way that addresses public safety. Somehow they have forgotten the duty to pursue the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not even worth the comparison. We need to be looking at expenditures on education, vs. prisons. And when I say education, I mean those working in the system who have no idea how cruel it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you , together we will explain this better than has been being done!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TracieOlsonPD Not just talking about our criminal courts, it is how we report on it.  Behind every cruel or malicious prosecution is an elected DA willing to prosecute a grandma for recording police in a courthouse and a judge who took an oath who is willing to kill her.  https://t.co/LBexI3PYNp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like  you are acclimating. . Guess it is a toss up- wild fires or winter! Glad you got this moment!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any doctors out there offering medically educed comas til this is all over?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TownLG @LGMSPolice   cops have no idea how to address issues related to domestic violence, but  divorce lawyers know exactly how to rig a case to make $50,000 more off a divorce. Not about protecting families, about money for divorce lawyers and private judges. @LeahGillisLaw  https://t.co/Zv4969T1dj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time for lobbyist but not for  residents who are unemployed, facing eviction &amp; struggling with a pandemic and civil unrest related to  @SanJosePD violating civil rights. They are here for the real estate and @sliccardo  and @Jeff_Rosen  will help them get it!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What reporters don't know to report on. What police officers and  prosecutors ever reveal! Privacy- never know how important it is until it is lost.  @StephenJamesUS  @josephtullylaw @LeahGillisLaw @BrendonWoodsPD @radleybalko @NateGartrell @UCDavisLaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Next up: @AlamedaCounty  courts  -  and  not so sure.  #DA should have reached out through  their victim services pursuant to Marsy's law. @Cal_OES  funds services crime victims, but allows some counties to divert the funds to useless staff , @SCCgov , so I am watching!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, the criminal system is broken and sadly there never really is justice for victims of crimes. But there is a difference in how they are handled from city to city and county to county and IMO, the PD there will work better than in @SCCgov  and other counties I have reported on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I remember when my eldest son could vote, he was so proud, when my other sons could vote, they had begun to lose trust in the voting process. I do hope we can capture the spirit Seth Smith and his mom had on this day for all of our kids in our future elections.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrodesmi : Wanted to let you know- @berkeleypolice   complied with a records request yesterday. Their  response demonstrates that good folks are working to assure all the justice possible in your son's case. Remember local voting is the most important vote folks have  in #2020.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guardianship is one of the most insidious practices in our modern society. It is about power and money and usually the most vulnerable are rolled over in the process. Not a solely a rich person problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NateGartrell  undoubtedly-  best local journalist in CA covering the courts. From Mark Peterson to @DianeBecton these corrupt DAs have defined the culture in our criminal courts. Excellent reporting Nate! @robertsalonga  time to catch up in @SantaClaraDA  https://t.co/faLR95yHDf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When the last paper is shuttered and the newsrooms all closed, our democracy will die. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom defining his judicial  legacy with  @SantaClaraDA  who engaged in public corruption and election rigging to  2015-Ramos' corrupt acts saw the recall of a judge and the re-election of his boss.

<|startoftext|>" When can we have tea with the Asian guys? "   Email @SantaClaraDA  @Jeff_Rosen sent back in 2013.

<|startoftext|>Why is Walmart and the local barber open, but not public meetings?  @SantaClaraDA  @Jeff_Rosen , AKA #BunkerBoy is hiding behind Zoom hearings and public meetings while public defenders and IDO attorneys have to go into the jails and courts with indigent clients. #Shameful  https://t.co/J37rIX9MQM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't  define  culture of a DA's office w/o looking at the individuals inside that office. History is important. The relationship between @Jeff_Rosen @sliccardo  and the @SanJosePD  is more toxic than one might think when it comes to modern law enforcement and criminal courts.  https://t.co/IfcOQYEnVk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NateGartrell @thomas_peele  In explaining our modern criminal court system, a wise lawyer once said: " Remember they take an oath promising to kill another human being."     Most judges were first prosecutors. It is a mindset- you have to report from that view!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NateGartrell  @josephtullylaw  judges are where the buck stops. They need to do far more than " roast" a DA. Until there are consequences for prosecutorial misconduct, prosecutors will continue to act like spoiled rich teenagers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SantaClaraDA also hired two fires of @chesaboudin  and then the @SCCgov hired a cop running a chop shop to be a code enforcer #TysonGreen. It is more than gall, it is entitled corruption counties pay to perpetuate!  https://t.co/9VTuYWleE8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the Great Photo case- @Jeff_Rosen charging me for filming police in violation a local rule, I was offered a plea to stay away from the courthouses for 2 years- guess what I said?   Three years later, no trial set. Time estimate 3 weeks- murder trials are shorter!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gotta hit them with photos and data - Show it even more simply- make it stand out. We can't fix stupid by we do have to dumb down to communicate these days!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God love ya @BrendonWoodsPD  apparently we have to show it in pictures because words are not working!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StateBarCA shut down meeting-  Zoom hijackers.   @SCCgov  Public Safety &amp; Justice meetings:  no access for non- Zoom and smartphone users.   Even voting won't help - most of these people will still be in public office!  We have to get louder- journalists have to work harder.  https://t.co/WXd4TF91tM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the mirror of our collective society folks! How do you think it is looking!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really have to ask why in Silicon Valley court users, school children and poor families have no access to the internet as libraries are shutters. This makes the human gap wider!  https://t.co/IoqIV0QBIW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely! This is a socioeconomic issue. Pro pers in family and civil matters and indigent clients incarcerated or trying to assist a public defender with closed law libraries and limited clerk hours. @SantaClaraDA  only shows up for press conferences, with a body guard!  https://t.co/xTaDedZPjG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn't that true with all - maybe just not as overt !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After dealing with super nasty PIOs in @SCCgov  it was refreshing to work with every one in at the @berkeleypolice in getting my records- you all rock !

<|startoftext|>Family courts, court appointments and the insidious use of private judges only operate in darkness and somehow this has become acceptable in our modern society.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thomas_peele @NateGartrell  @FACoalition @radleybalko  @josephtullylaw @LeahGillisLaw  @thesajidakhan @BrendonWoodsPD - Think: If courts are operating in part - but indigent and  socioeconomically disadvantaged have no access to public libraries to research and defend cases...  https://t.co/vZLPQhUnah<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SCCgov was quick to " FACT CHECK " my reporting on TYSON GREEN- then apologized, exposing  the county to vicarious liability in a single tweet. Note: no comment on Halcon &amp; @Jeff_Rosen misusing state and federal grant funds or accounting records drafted by a 3 year old!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SLOCounty_DA  is now a contender for a #2020 Darwin Award ! Here is a little video of the cops likely scrambling to help this DA put their case together @JoaquinValley @DavisVanguard -   https://t.co/9ubX6tQTBe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chump change- @SCCgov  steals more than that in federal money in a week!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not time to Remember the Alamo, time to remember @DES!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn't it funny that cops can now find those videos and DAs can find the law? Think they took a crash course over the summer?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is it the State Bar never talks about the attorneys and corrupt @SantaClaraDA  conduct during COVID? Divorce lawyers are making record fee awards for DV cases that are bogus during this time while courts are essentially shuttered for all other court users and  the indigent.  https://t.co/ll50gG339n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent- one of my favorite publishers finding us these stories! Pull time and let a jury see a DA willing to risk the health of jurors to hear a case were cops are " still scrambling " to find any witness willing to support this BS. Prosecutors such as these have aged out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reminds me of when California got busted using traffic court to make the socioeconomically disadvantaged more disadvantaged by stripping driver's licenses from those who could not afford to pay their fines. Our legal system has become a system of cruelty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Commented, it is far more that that- Title IV ghost children. Domestic Violence - and my personal favorites - Tyson Green and Ward Penfold converting properties and Kasey Halcon stealing federal grant money from rape and DV victims. Wait for it # indictments coming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is because we have:  Election Fatigue Covid Fatigue Corruption Fatigue Bad Cop Fatigue  and I personally have @Jeff_Rosen  stupidity , abuse of power and racism fatigue.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IRStaxpros if @SCCgov employee Kasey Halcon is using public funds to pay private businesses to do repairs on county property,  shouldn't the support documents for a 1"scrach repair to a counter require a tad more in the way of support documentation? #AuditFail  https://t.co/U4C32Z1DLm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SCCgov Is this how all the money the county spends is supported? This was to fix a 1" scratch in the @SantaClaraDA victim services office. Any 3rd grade math skills required to work there?  Do you remodel your houses with bids like this?  @IRSnews  https://t.co/UrJ9ACrEzi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Public Record of the Week: @SantaClaraDA  Kasey Halcon offered  a rape victim a $250 cash card as only means of help.  12 months later - Halcon ordered a 1" scratch  in the counter of her  office fixed for $2,131. Wonder if Halcon's 3rd grader did the math on the invoice.  https://t.co/y5PMQ1T4al<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you are going to do the math, have to factor in all the money he got away with not paying because folks couldn't afford to pay a lawyer to file a suit!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Would argue Summer of 2020 = Summer of 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975 and probably  few in the 1920s and 1930s !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The privatization of our jails- every wonder why they aren't filled with middle class or rich folks? Someday we will be appalled we took so long to demand reform in our courts and law enforcement agencies!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In covering these protests on a hyper local level- have found  protests by BOTH sides equally problematic. There is always one or two in every crowd. One bad apple and all. Amazing at the vitriol in the election, the likes I've never seen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOW and the judge allowed that reason?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It seems it is working everywhere better than here. In Mexico I understood University was free for all who wanted to attend. Here is my current project on that :  https://t.co/WoXNADqCLx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SCCgov tweeted on Friday: Tyson Green,  the cop who ran a chop shop and was criminally prosecuted,  is NOT the same person the county hired as a CODE ENFORCER to work with #WardPenfold and levy fines on local property  and land owners- you decide:  https://t.co/jq7SHiccWz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why aren't you discussing the wealthy who cheated by paying as much as $500K to get their daughters into college. It is a culture, not a gender issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking at these images now- does anyone wonder if they thought they looked badass? It really wasn't the outfits , it is what they did in them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have  to educate our sons and  daughters and start  by setting better examples. @mldauber  incited hate and projected for her own personal reasons. Persky paid the price. So arguably did Turner. Dauber had an opportunity to educate. She elected to project instead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great image! Thank you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mostly it is just sad that regardless if someone supports @realDonaldTrump or #BLM that when we see someone  dead in the street after being shot by another human being- we still want to argue about who was right and who was wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First private judges. Now private cops!   Did #TysonGreen unleash the cockroaches while on a code enforcement call in Coyote Valley? @eBay @SantaClaraPD @LeahGillisLaw @josephtullylaw @BrendonWoodsPD @radleybalko @pulcrano  @thomas_peele  https://t.co/hMyn3K7dEy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And then he became a @SCCgov employee - with a pension and all- oh and the county tried to say it is a different person. So now we gotta pull the file- already did the records request! @SusanEllenberg @SupCindyChavez @Mike__Wasserman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ms. Bassi has #Gaslighting immunity. They tried it all, but there is about to be a new #Gaslighing game in town!  Our #freepress is a cornerstone of our democracy. Time to get it kicked back into shape.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds like some government  officials got caught with their hand in the cookie jar! @SCC_OES<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I take back my correction and apology- sounds like @SCCgov  continues to protect cops who were outright criminals - even running chop shops . Are you saying this is not the same person? Fact check this!  https://t.co/FHdFsELf2l<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is that because he got busted running a chop shop and @Jeff_Rosen gave another @SantaClaraPD  a sweetheart deal and he is now employed with the county as a code enforcement officer putting fines and fees on properties with corrupt government lawyer #WardPenfold?  https://t.co/lF0C5EfGDl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SCCgov - better not be trying to cover up public corruption involving cops by trying to discredit me. Are you claiming the @SantaClaraPD in this criminal complaint is NOT the same as the " code enforcer" working with #WardPenfold ? Be very careful how you  answer.  @mercnews  https://t.co/wreVVXUUyb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Didn't read yet, but hit the highlights- is Kurt going to shave cause that is really carrying COVID too far!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is not new - they just keep it secret and no reporters report on it as they report on kids at the border.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He did ! And was California's only elected PD! He would be super proud of you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not worth it for most in my generation- and the younger generations only used going to the movies to get out of the house on a legit excuse! Hint: Your teens weren't at the movies the way everyone over 50 was!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still waiting for public records &amp; @SCCgov  social media folks to fact check  outright corruption in the @SantaClaraDA - anyone able to show me this is a mistake or not true? @SupCindyChavez @SusanEllenberg @Mike__Wasserman @joesimitian @DaveCortese @LeahGillisLaw @thesajidakhan  https://t.co/8fTXKiGgJ9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for the FACT CHECK:  happy to correct. Appreciate @SCCgov quick to correct  on this,  but non-responsive on other county hires,   #SaherStephan #SeanWebby,  who are put in positions managing public money w/  bankruptcy, misconduct and outright crimes in their background.  https://t.co/WxjSaPlNkS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you:  appreciate you guys are keeping up on that information so no MISINFORMATION is disseminated. Would be great if you comply with lawful #CPRA requests to make sure reporters can do their jobs as quickly on these newsworthy issues #SB1421!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Darling photo every mom would love to share, then I read the article. Folks this is happening in our family courts times 1 million every day. Judges and lawyers have no idea how to act in the best interest of children. Only in their own interest and that of a broken system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Informants are crooks. The fact that police are trusting them over a grandma watching a grandchild is outrageous!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is a culture folks - just think what goes through a police officer's mind when this is being done to teachers in the name of training! @IRE_NICAR  this is in your backyard- get busy!  https://t.co/pi4CqxUwd8  https://t.co/aOOCgzFrPA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Freakin love librarians - hope there aren't any lurking in Karen Videos on YouTube. Gotta give me just one thing to still believe in!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting the political strategies now appear to be taken from parenting handbooks- IGNORING THE TANTRUM- that does usually have a pretty effective outcome., Speaking as a parent who dealt with lots of boys having tantrums!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going to discuss officer training in calls for domestic violence, human trafficking &amp; police reports?   Going  to  chat about that " predictive policing" software ? Or refusal to investigate sexual assault claims @LosGatosHigh  &amp; crimes related to family court cases? #Bradanini ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>" The media copies and pastes the lies without thinking critically about them" - and if we don't call that out on a local level, it becomes a national problem! @pulcrano put your big boy publisher pants back on, you have had them off for too long!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds like both sides care, just about different stuff!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ironic timing, when  a judge is actually set to  rule on prosecutorial misconduct related to @Jeff_Rosen -  Stay safe court users- staffers  @BrendonWoodsPD   @GackleReport<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just heard the number of police officer shootings are exactly the same this year as they were for the same time period last year. WTF?  https://t.co/eX49fKo2xv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOW - this is on all of us. Have to wonder how many more are simmering out there- this is 17 today. So much hate how do we reverse course?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh you mean like this guy who I saw leave the witness stand and meet McDonald in the bathroom - #WitnessTapering and now makes nearly $500K and is leader of the #SJPOA?  https://t.co/VtYiKil3e0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GackleReport Sadly this is how  @SantaClaraDA  has treated crime victims who could not get Jeff Rosen re-elected. Rosen rips pages from the  playbook of Hitler. He views nothing but his power as important and enjoys inciting hate from his @TownofLAH  bunker - #corrupt - Godspeed - we got you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenJamesUS  private judging trumps elected judges when it comes to corrupting our courts- pass it on- report it- name it and call it out !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You would have voted for him because he was a brilliant marketing guy, just like @realDonaldTrump  and @Jeff_Rosen - until people question what they read and see and until reporters are trained to question public officials and not just print their political statements as gospel..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is it going to take folks? We have cameras , and no change. We have media coverage, and no change. In fact our criminal courts and cops look the same, only worse because now they just do it on Zoom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One rape victim I interviewed told me she can't wear heels and now always wears jeans with a belt. There are always adjustments you will have to make to continue to survive. On the other side is makeup and brushed hair when you feel like it! Yes, it is normal. Godspeed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wonder what all these reporters are going to cover when Trump is out of office? Think they will remember the importance of local reporting?  More corruption is looming in local communities that publishers have abandoned these past four years to focus on outrage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love when local publishers whine about the business practices of their competitors. Kind of like the pot calling the kettle black. Publishing is a business. Journalists are vastly underpaid and most can't afford to live in Silicon Valley where journalism is needed more than ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is the world you get when local publishers don't hold public officials accountable and they invest in Walmart stock over their own Main Street businesses. In @SCCgov the Supervisors have $2 billion in off shore accounts and Walmart stock, but no money for local businesses!  https://t.co/THMaRLY8Dd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So corrupt - they all know it and they pretend we don't see it. DO NOT EVER AGREE TO USE A PRIVATE JUDGE IT IS THE MOST CORRUPT PRACTICE IN AMERICA'S COURTS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Smart mama, good school district, you did everything right!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It sure stood out- let's see what #EFF has on #LasVegasPD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It will never mend, we can only try to make it count. Am sorry, my hear aches with you on each photo- where did he go to high school?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you- I hope one day these will be easier to remember. He was everyone's son. Smart. Was he graduating a year early- trying to do the math!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is there a reason @Jeff_Rosen  didn't investigate or charge those involved in fraud connected to the #AudriePottFoundation? Oh yea, that is right- @Rosen used the Pott case to get re-elected in 2014. Any such prosecution would be like Trump ordering prosecution of Steve Bannon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also reading the @FPPC laws @Jeff_Rosen  violated during the 2016- 2018 campaign. This is what it looks like when a public official knows they are moments away from federal investigation and #Indictment Even the @mercnews  and @pulcrano can't protect him now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this is what that air looked like yesterday!  https://t.co/EMFyh6IBoE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First house I bought in Sacramento , California ( 1989) had CCRs that prohibited black homeowners completely. That was a tad shocking 3 years after graduating from @ucdavis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like divorce court in @SCSCourt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trauma fire reporting:  Oakland fires as new mom.  Santa Clara in 2020 Lessons:  Save your photos.  Keep yourself safe. Be good to your neighbors. Hug your loved ones.  Most people are good,  not is  on tv for the #2020 election. All the  rest is just stuff.  Thanks @sccfiredept  https://t.co/1Myb131suM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Private judging is so secret that when an out-of-area lawyer files a DQ and threatens to expose it, a battle ensues. The fight will be blamed on the parties, but is really about the corrupt trying to protect what is clearly criminal activity arising from our public courts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They sure don't want me reporting on what their office is doing. This we know #privatejudge - John Chase #electionrigging - @Jeff_Rosen  failing crime victims and stealing federal money - Kasey Halcon, Terry Harman, Nicole Ford.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They aren't done editing it yet ! @sliccardo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, some publishers do forget. How is public trust  measured? Awards from  the industry? Businesses willing to pay to  advertise? Engagement? Or remembering to hold public officials accountable, instead of worrying about what parties to go to with them? @SantaClaraDA @sliccardo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3 months since George Floyd. All the recordings and still this? Look at the faces of those children! When are we going to stop and think about what they are seeing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe she knows about the private judging scam @GavinNewsom  benefited from getting her in , and then not posting that case  in the courthouse as the law requires. CRC 2.834.  https://t.co/zr3twv7EOF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here goes @mldauber again on the projections. Hey Michele thought you were too sick to make it as a witness in my criminal case. Looks like you are better! We got some questions for you about those emails and photos!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pulcrano - sound familiar? Apply locally ! @Jeff_Rosen @SantaClaraDA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Godspeed and thanks for the photo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right - left it for you guys to say. And maybe not free- they might make $ 1 for the day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Freaking love this. In a world where kids are seeing what our modern police have become- it is so important fire not be lumped in. Fires kill people. Firefighters rescue people! @SJFD @sccfiredept @gilroyffs  @scottsvalleyFD @morganhillfire<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is related to the shortage of free prison labor. COVID, early releases or hunger strike - take your pick!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait didn't he say that for his own campaign and yet here we are. @GavinNewsom getting federal money when you know counties like @SCCgov misused the billons in state and federal money they already got and @Cal_OES  did nothing , is a tad shameful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These are why illegal recordings are valuable. Can't use them in court, but in the end the court of public opinion matters more!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have you ever noticed looking into a woman's financials is done like a pap smear- full stirrups , while men just have to cough and they are good to go?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have to say when it comes to legal pleadings and Amicus, @CREWcrew  is always a stand out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And hearing from the other side.....  https://t.co/0RCCtdLzRY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best Sign: How many weren't filmed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When we worry more about the volume of dishonestly rather than the dishonesty itself, aren't we really talking Hobson's Choice?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ucdavisvetmed  shaming the name. Gotta to wonder about the ethics being taught in our public universities. #TaniCantilSakuye comes to mind at the top of the list! Usually really proud of my school. Not so much lately. 2011 @UCDavisPolice maced the kids.  Now a vet professor?  https://t.co/GhoHwxpvMk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or used for education which is in a state of famine!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad that elections are no longer measured by hope and promise but by the lesser of misery!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOW, how much resources has that guy sucked out of CA these past 20 years?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yea, don't think it is effective to make that a race issue. Naming victims who die at the hands of a corrupt system or culture should not be a black or white issue. It is a human issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What update can he possibly give? That all he can do is standby and watch because when he could have acted, he didn't ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely - there is a direct correlation to increased court and police spending while decreased funding in education putting us where we are today. @berkeleyside  and countless others sounding this alarm for years. @berkeleypolice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone realize that everything journalists used to report as happening in foreign lands with corrupt governments has been actually happening right here at home?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just noticing this issue - @SantaClaraDA  @Jeff_Rosen  prosecuting two journalists critical of his office for mishandling federal grant money earmarked for crime victims! Meanwhile he dismissed arrests of reporters who report favorably on his office. Focus needs to be on the DA !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know local news is getting crushed and journalists are sloppy and untrained when it comes to reporting on criminal and family court issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually don't think anyone has a problem understanding the @StateBarCA does little to protect the public from dirty and corrupt lawyers. They do lots to protect lawyers who grow up to be judges. @SantaClaraDA  case in point. Corruption  back to #JimTowery employment in 2010.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Opps - record everything when dealing with the powerful and corrupt !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Journalist vs. Corrupt DA - Bet's ? This pleading was filed by @SantaClaraDA  in early 2020. This video was made six months later:  https://t.co/YKtWkvGBnV Since @Jeff_Rosen  is fond of trying his cases in the media, so  it's game on. Who do you think is hysterical? @DavisVanguard  https://t.co/theGKDwnFD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe instead of grieving @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris should be reflecting on what they have done for 20 years to contribute to this culture. THREE generations of kids impacted and we wonder why we have trust issues?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gotta fight harder, even cameras catching these images is not stopping the mindset and culture!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOW- @CAL_FIRE recently reported they are unprepared for fires because of their reliance on prisoners in the past which is now being depleted because of COVID ( and arguably public oversight of criminal justice reform!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Investigating the relationship between @Mldauber and @Jeff_Rosen  which is consistent with public corruption &amp; obstruction of justice. Not investigating the conduct of those underlying case. That is for others to debate.  @SantaClaraDA corruption is a matter of public interest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>wow! NEVER cease to be amazed at media coverage like that. Did that get that from the police or DA? Discrediting begins early and often.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These are the issues we need to report on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rich People are on Fire: This is the wealthiest area of Silicon Valley. Wonder if folks are regretting investing in @Facebook  @Google , etc instead of @sccfiredept  and resources we all need! @GavinNewsom:  better adjust your game plan - your children are watching.  https://t.co/BwDxj3dWUP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doing it because her kids are doing school from home. Regardless of your politics , this is every mom and dad's dilemma  in #2020.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most folks I know never even got the $1200 check!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TracieOlsonPD Share  details of the stories. Few people understand: Criminal justice reform does not mean just letting folks out of jail who pose a serious threat to society. Also, people don't understand the serious threat under prosecuted white collar crime poses for society.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOL- does feel like we were sitting at the bar at 2 am - just not sure who thought who was prettier- Rosen of Dauber or Dauber of Rosen- IMO there is not enough vodka or wee hours to unsee that !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When the 49ers came to town, they brought their culture with them. Secondary employment, bros bumping fists and the protection these guys had in every aspect of our criminal justice system was sickening. @Jeff_Rosen  recall won't be an option #Indictment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mental health issues in our  collective society  #2020.

<|startoftext|>By the end of the weekend- California Wild Fires Will have done more harm in 2 weeks than COVID has done in six months. Only thing we know for sure is CA has underfunded fire and overfunded police and still old @GavinNewsom  plays to his base- all of which is suffering!  https://t.co/cagtlfQVyF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow and my boys always tried to convince me video games weren't dangerous!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This doesn't come close to the sound and the heat you feel , but seeing it is better than having someone describe it in words. Please record in the horizontal position.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, I see your email and have a @mldauber email to top it!  https://t.co/i9e8gMOMvi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOW even in a Post George Floyd Era we have DAs not willing to address that resisting arrest charges are almost always used to cover up police misconduct and brutality. This is clogging our courts - start calling out all of it . Good for this woman not taking the plea!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shout out to one of California's best online news outlets willing to actually cover the courts and not just engaging in stenographic journalism.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Poor @thomas_peele : Wanted you to see what poor Tom actually looked like on our 2017 #IRE lunch date when I got to talk about public records and court transcripts! @JasonLeopold - probably same look!

<|startoftext|>1. Cops  2. Lawyers  3. Court Corruption<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Start with the family unit, it is the first lawyer of socioeconomic justice. Divorce kids are t10 times more likely  than kids with married parents to be abused by the courts, the schools and other " systems" in society . Mainstream media only talks about celebrity divorces.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN continues the cycle. Cop, divorce lawyer and they get away with this for 30 years? Time to focus on who was silent and how it happened, not just that it did. This is Sharon Huddle, the divorce attorney ruining the lives of innocent families while her husband raped and killed  https://t.co/YgvJoo8nPq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And few people know he was married to Sharon Huddle , a divorce attorney in Sacramento causing quite a bit of harm herself during this time. Of course MSM not covering divorce cases for the past 30 years missed the major story. Again.  https://t.co/vspG9AqcST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely ! 8 years in and I still feel ignorant!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most I have seen don't have insurance and taxpayers actual pay even when one side has more money than God.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not worth giving them the power if they abuse it. Time for some judicial education about the natural and probable outcome of not addressing court corruption.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. Each time they call me crazy for speaking up, I know I am right and just get louder. Then I started recording them so that others could decide who was actually crazy! Survey said- 15K on my side of crazy- 915 on theirs !  https://t.co/x3lBTKcpQ1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Need help with a visual victim impact statement for Seth. Anyone who has any photos or info from his time at @UCBerkeley , please PM or email me : GilroyBassi@Gmail.com<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know that one too. #DrRebeccaBailey upwards of $100K - apparently only rich kids with divorcing parents need to be reunited with the parents the courts rip away. It is the most corrupt thing we have ever seen, and no MSM media has paid for the ink!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My heart aches for you @mrodesmi - no mother should ever face this. @BerkeleyPD  made an arrest and sounds like good investigative  work - lets make sure the courts do not drop the ball again. #MarsysLaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When community policing alone won't cut it. We are going to have to make some wise decisions in the months to come!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For those of us old enough to remember the Oakland fire, this is triggering. Stay safe everyone- more wind and lightening coming this weekend! @thomas_peele  Godspeed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Supervised visitation is perhaps one of the most insidious secrets of the courts. Parents who squawk about paying a babysitter $20 / hr. have no idea courts are ordering parents to pay $250 . hr. to see their own children during divorce cases. Judges and lawyers own interests.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To investigate judges:  have to know their tricks, flaws and  weaknesses. In family court this is the first trick indicating public corruption. One parent hurls allegations. The other parent is placed on supervised visitation, often paying up to $250 an hour to see their kid.  https://t.co/v4v1f2NhT9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well , that is not a trait reserved for @realDonaldTrump  I can find you folks in local government, business and key leadership positions in Silicon Valley who didn't mature to middle school level! Some of the worst love when you tell them to stop tweeting, emailing and suing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always love how folks think $2 million is shocking for anyone near the White House. In Santa Clara County I can find you hundreds of corrupt public employees making far more- but nobody wants to report on that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Neighbors are helping neighbors on this one. DOn't fall for scams. Give money , food and donations directly to folks , not to some agency that can't handle it and will dilute it!. Look for churches, and community groups on @Facebook  and @Twitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I gotta wonder how many people who tell @realDonaldTrump  to stop tweeting were ever parents? Most parents know when you tell your kids to stop or to not do something, it makes them want to do it more! So you must not mean it, or you must not be a parent!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone think investigating Public Corruption means stumbling into it?  Think:  1. How many records requests were made?  2. How many corrupt folks retaliated?  3. How had an interest to make sure it was not reported?  4. Who was corrupt , complicit or incompetent   so it went on?  https://t.co/b5PuxVwP23<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Keep speaking up. Never know when folks will actually listen! Right @thesajidakhan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Overcompensation = Meaning the press is trying to move this to the front of the bus after leaving it at the back of the bus for 50 years. You will see this in every news organization. You will see cities declaring racism a public health crisis. That is whitesplaining.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now,  instead of making this one story on a national level, make it a local story - there are plenty more where Steve Bannon came from #AudriePottFoundation @Jeff_Rosen @SantaClaraDA @SupCindyChavez @DaveCortese @Mike__Wasserman @joesimitian<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @sliccardo maybe you should have been supporting @SJFD  instead of corrupt politicians, dirty cops and a crooked DA these past 10 years and we might be better prepared. @sliccardo - Not the guy you want helping in an emergency!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember as we evacuate our homes and lose our lifetime of belongings, it was @SupCindyChavez  @Mike__Wasserman @joesimitian @DaveCortese  and the supervisors who thought we needed more money for public officials, cops and a crooked DA than fire services in this county!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesajidakhan  You think retaliation against you for a blog post by @Jeff_Rosen  was bad, you  should see what he did to journalists asking for records related to #MarsysLaw @LeahGillisLaw @BrendonWoodsPD @GackleReport @NateGartrell @JennWadsworth @robertsalonga @StephenStockTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two years ago: Made a records request to @Cal_OES because of  money that appeared to be disappearing from @SantaClaraDA Victim Witness Services managed by corrupt Director Kasey Halcon. Now, @GavinNewsom says no money to fight the @CaliforniaFires? @GackleReport  https://t.co/twowGNeQzh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you- we all need to see these images.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad that this is considered remarkable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@akhan1437 Over 6000 connections on my LinkedIn. Most are journalists, criminal defense lawyers or civil rights attorneys. Some are  human beings. I posted your Tweet there. Hopefully some hear you- Some good ones already listening. #IRE @NateGartrell @thomas_peele @radleybalko  https://t.co/CgCFnqMVAO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely! It is not just bias, it is also complicit. When a reporter is so hung up on what an "academic"  or " lawyer" to justify their reporting, they just fail to do their job. It is lazy and the publishers need to step it up and demand more!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can you imagine what he did to his two wives in divorce court? Bet they never even saw the returns!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only working if you know how to apply what you learned by watching!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is state parks, county parks, national forests and down to the beach. And it is only August! @CAStateParks @GavinNewsom shift money from broken courts and cops to fire and environmental resources. And aid for those losing their homes in fires or the pandemic !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Becky, Karen and @PattyArquette  Police Reform will likely go the way of #ERA. Here is how:  1. Issue ignites public outrage ( George Floyd)  2. Small window to success ( protests  in America's streets)  3. Those in power who can make change, don't.   https://t.co/LWWClDf0jc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5 in #1million you see @Jimbealljr   I am betting there are a million Beckys out there willing to tell you a million times to put  cop reform issues back on the table.  And For the Record;  Us Beckys are getting sick and tired of what you guys are doing under the table.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@3 of #1millon and @Jimbealljr  had to know @SheliaPott was lying, but he went and put his name on a bill she used to get that @Netflix movie produced #AudrieandDaisy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2 of #1million - @Jimbealljr also knows that I have photos of him at the @NorCalInnocence meeting where he knew the cops lied and put that young innocent black man in jail and you promised you were going to help him get @Restiution, and I am willing to bet you never did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeckyHarmanEdwards You are absolutely my favorite Becky! Every person in this state needs to send a tweet to their  senator and  @Jimbealljr . Jim Beall is my senator and he knows that I know that he supported @Jeff_Rosen and the #AudriePottFoundation. 1 of #1million<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you to ALL Fire Fighters, Interns and even good neighbors working on all the fires in #BenLomond #ScottsValley #SanJose @SantaCurz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is nobody reporting that EDD is busted. Of the 15 people I know who filed since March, only one got the weekly $600. So where is that money? And numbers are only down because people gave up online and on those emergency phone lines. @GavinNewsom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOL , I was in a WeChat with a group of students from @UCBerkeley  wanting to know what was happening to a Chinese mom in a court case I covered. Man could they chat. I had to ask them to switch to English, and they did. But amazed at how they connected. Shameful blocking it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very sad. Used to write this up in @MyOutAbout - Godspeed to all there- looks like we will have to organize a socially distanced barn raising this fall! Let me know when you are ready!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And maybe if @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris  care about our Democracy that needs journalists more than ever, they will see @realDonaldTrump  ad and raise him a front page on @nytimes @sacbee_news @sfchronicle @latimes and @MyOutAbout<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PostOpinions  This is a business decision. 100 percent about journalism. This is not about politics, this is about keeping our journalists working. @radleybalko recently saved my life on a story. If @realDonaldTrump  helps pay for the ink on that story, I am grateful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I often wonder what the judges think. Do they know they are right behind the Thin Blue Line and we can see them? Until we name these judges and put words and images to what they have done, it will not change. Two generations impacted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Humbling photo. Thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NONPROFIT FRUAD , as applied to a local community. Thanks Steve Bannon for the Blueprint. Reporters..... Go do your job!  https://t.co/5vUH8aSMFc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who knew there were that many folks interested in getting GPS trackers off their cars! It drives the cops nuts that I could careless if they GPS me. What are they going to get my shopping list at Whole Foods or my Fed Ex receipt from the last bar complaint I shot off?  https://t.co/KH61ATQAk6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Freaking love it- What day is trash collected in the Rose Garden? James Towery and his wife  Karyn Sinunu did really bad Zoom meetings from there for the San Jose Rotary.  @pulcrano baby announcement only got 3 views - one was mine -  that messy little antitrust watching and all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And when it comes to holding local government accountable, it is all hands on deck and @jennwadsworth  does a great job, often beating the @mercnews  reporters to the punch. Someday @pulcrano  won't quash anything!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the emotion we feel when they are on fire! #benlomond #ScottsValley<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gotta love grandparents, we save that sh*t! It is what I grabbed in the #CaliforniFires this week!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gotta ask how you came across the price on that. Was it like on #PriceisRight reruns during the pandemic?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Steve Bannon applied locally. These stepparents trolled Silicon Valley collecting donations, "educating children" and making @Netflix deals for #AudrieandDaisy. Turns out they were doing exactly what Bannon did, only it was worse than promising a wall. Support local journalism!  https://t.co/7RnTLSPhVq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yea,  my mom is in that photo. They told us they got it done. They didn't. Burning bras and protesting- 1975. Not sure what it got us - feels worse now than it was then. At least then we could stay home with our kids and not have some judge frown and impute us for phantom income.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>was it is @SanMateoPD or @SanJosePD  cop's like last time ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And dirty corrupt divorce lawyers acting as private judges! Seems like there should be one free punch for those guys!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Make sure you pump up the ETHICS classes, old Tani Cantil Sakauye is NOT doing us proud! And teach the lawyers we are coming to dry up that corrupt private judge gig so they better know CCP 638, 639 and CRC 2.834 cause we are watching!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We needed to be budgeting far more for fire than police these past ten years! Be safe out there guys and thank you for what you do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom  #California killed a powerful police reform bill. Duly elected officials  do not appear to be interested in police reform issues in the post #GeorgeFloyd era, meaning the status quo will likely remain. @sliccardo remember this ? Three years later, where is it?  https://t.co/IwoxErYlyr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely ! Sitting in prison does nothing except make the innocent and the guilty more bitter. That is far more dangerous for society. So count me as one for your opinion not being " unpopular" but wise!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It should be a requirement for every judge and prosecutor!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These are my friends and neighbors. Very nice reporting. Hope folks are paying attention. When your houses are on fire this year, nobody is coming except those in your community!  https://t.co/srFs9hLAPh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So when @AnnMRavel  started making a big deal about #DarkMoney in elections, whistleblowers pointed us to the $3 billion @SCCgov  has in off shore accounts and investments. Oddly enough, Ann Ravel had a big role in this dark money. Need data scrapers! @business @WSJ  https://t.co/75NjJGv1we<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOW, @netflix  appears to be America's new problematic publisher!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These are the people whose votes for Sheriff or DA actually might mean something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CAL_FIRE announced today that they have no funding and have used prisoners' to fight fires in the past, but now with COVID have lost that " asset". Seems like we could have trained an army of firefighters over the past 20 years instead of jailing folks for smoking weed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOL- I think I gave up telling my kids what to do when my 2 year-old pulled his pacifier out and told me something I had said was not logical. You go, we messed this up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And thank you for the rage!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AudriePottFoundation @Netflix-  The Potts used the courts to silence Audrie's real dad. They did it for a $3 million civil settlement &amp;  $10 million deal for #AudrieandDaisy - Shame on everyone who tried to silence the truth. Today there was justice. Now the truth with be told.  https://t.co/5Guid6HD3O<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now This- Los Gatos- Ben Lomond - Santa Cruz one hour ago !  https://t.co/xChT1SKziy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last week I tried to report a fire hazard. 6 @SCCoSheriff and @SCCgov park rangers spent 1.5 hours giving me an off leash ticket for a dog they didn't see. They did nothing about the fire hazard @sccfiredept . This is a photo from same location today!  https://t.co/E3Nl0yeBhf  https://t.co/XEG91rMP8h<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All my neighbors got out  last night!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We read the court files- even the jury appeared to question these issues. Turner's lawyer either didn't or couldn't provide a proper defense! The media did not accurately report. @juliasulek  left out the important parts. The DA was re-elected as a result.  https://t.co/9hwCRi7vlo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Follow the endorsement! When Investigating public corruption coming from the @SantaClaraDA  office - we looked to who endorsed @Jeff_Rosen. Guess what we found? @thesajidakhan @LeahGillisLaw @svdebug @DavisVanguard @TracieOlsonPD @BrendonWoodsPD @GackleReport #PublicCorruption  https://t.co/jxXTaRdaEJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chalesfinley What if everything you read in the paper about the Turner was not true?  Plenty of rape cases w/  positive SART kits and victims who were not blacked out. Wonder why @Mldauber never wanted to talk about those cases and @Jeff_Rosen  never wanted to  prosecute them?  https://t.co/xuG2f2IPBB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Read the police reports, not  @mldauber reports. Most reporters have no idea how to read a police report, or court transcript. Wonder: Why only  one case like this in Silicon Valley for the two years Michele Dauber brought in PAC money to recall a judge?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This happens far more than folks know. Now there are more children who will not trust the cops. But hey they have immunity so what do they care!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Speaking of trust, it is time to talk about the fraud @Mldauber and @Jeff_Rosen  imposed from 2015 - 2018 to rig  local elections and chill speech. A lynch mob led by  #Dauber and #Pott  is heading for @LosGatosHigh - This time there are going to be real reporters there waiting!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Good, any ethical journalist would.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was there when my single mom was protesting for the ERA! It wasn't until I was a single mom myself that I found out my mom's generation didn't change the law. Looks like my generation better hurry or we won't either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>" I have a black friend" feels similar to @Jeff_Rosen  boasting about having taken 15 prosecutors to Selma. Dotted line to his big Civil Rights Awakening. Must have been some sleep, I have to wait two months to get public records on that trip! @LeahGillisLaw @radleybalko  https://t.co/ErTFg3UJAw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YES! @StateBarCA  @Cal_OES @SantaClaraDA  @SCCgov @SupCindyChavez @SusanEllenberg  @Jeff_Rosen @CaSupremeCourt , but it is the actions of the people, an agency alone can't be corrupt. It is corrupted by the complicit , indifferent and corrupt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today I heard a recording from the National Human Trafficking Hotline that @SantaClaraDA  is not investigating human trafficking cases because of COVID 19. Hasn't seemed to stop them from investigating BS nonviolent cases to justify the full pay they are getting during COVID.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Addressing the #JusticeGap is far more important than the wage gap! Starting out behind the ball, unable to afford a lawyer or getting sub par pro bono work or underpaid public defenders, this is where the focus needs to be!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Black or White, must start to look at what California's courts have done to women and children over the past 20 years. It all began with the little words, " mother's pensions". Until we stop judging mothers harshly for the hardest job in the world, nothing will change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SaraLibby  you are absolutely my hero ! Thank you. Reporting on the police is the most important job a journalist can do these days- this is what happens when that job is done well. This is how our democracy is supposed to work! Thanks for the ink!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know I never thought of that before. Self-deprecating humor is a necessity in life, you are right the real narcissists don't have that !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely rocks! This is how it is supposed to work. DA's , PDs and human beings take note. Pay attention. There are some journalists in town learning to report on cops! @josephtullylaw @greg_doucette @ScottHech @radleybalko @ACLU_NorCal @robertsalonga @thomas_peele @FACoalition<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is true. And use humor. They really can't stand that. You can't beat them at their game in court, sports, or politics, but humor reduces them to human beings that are completely naked!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awesome- I know some great garbage collectors. More honest than all the lawyers I know put together!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cory is only great if he is willing to call out his friends the same as he calls out his foes! Will he?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When is old Sammy going to worry about the  infrastructures he is responsible for ( @sliccardo - the police, the libraries, the schools, the public records @SanJoseCivic  never seems to produce!)  In your court the shirtless teacher roams- are you giving out free rapist vans too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If @CalOes would claw back all the state and federal grants @Jeff_Rosen , Kasey Halcon, &amp; @SantaClaraDA stole over the past five years, every Californian could use the money for a free air conditioner. Call it the cold cash corruption rebate! @GackleReport do you have air ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOW real geniuses. Bet no tuition reductions included in that move!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good to know, but today the @DOJPH  reported local law enforcement agencies are not investigating human trafficking cases during COVID. So guess all the folks trafficked here, not getting help by the @SantaClaraDA  can at least stay cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IME The Postal Inspector has historically been more proactive in prosecuting mail fraud. Most responsive public agency, would hate to see that be eroded since most other prosecuting agencies in the federal government are virtually useless when it comes to white collar crimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Based on what science? Gotta figure they are just making this up as they go! @GavinNewsom ( kind of like CA private judging)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't think it will be police , COVID or the economy , the winner of the 2020 election will be the ones who fix this before the election!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, think we need to start making all the post office workers celebrities. Who hates the mail person? I have always loved every single one !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOL love when they both accuse each other for the same tricks. Better figure the @POSTOFFICE has grandparent protection. ANYONE F-ing with the possibility of us getting letters or photos of our grandkids, is going down. Applies to both sides!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love this man!  https://t.co/ix2EEsYhZ4 He was right- CA has #2, wishy washy on #1, and I am working hard on #3 !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got my hands full of crooked cops, prosecutors, judges and supervisors, no time to look elsewhere  until we have them locked up and out of the public harming business! @SupCindyChavez @SusanEllenberg  @DaveCortese @joesimitian @Mike__Wasserman @Jeff_Rosen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is how it feels to investigate a corrupt @SantaClaraDA - not going to mind all the crashing and burning when we finally clear the hurdles that will get him indicted and removed from continued public harm!  https://t.co/sNWGF93ewJ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Probably, that excuse has now eclipsed the old dog eating the homework excuse that has been around for decades and could have actually happened!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavisVanguard  thanks for covering this! We need to do media requests to capture these statements on video. It reveals more problems in the DA offices. Sound familiar @GackleReport ?   Reporters  need educating  on what victims face in our broken courts!  https://t.co/weeKYU7G5m<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Local cops  claim no resources to investigate white collar crimes and human trafficking during COVID.   Apparently have the resources to write tickets and put tech in place to keep collecting fees to pay these cops and judges to  not do the job they are paid to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you actually run across ANY cop being charged for that, please post. CA is not seeing that anywhere I can find!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is always the emails that bust them. We got 6000 between @SantaClaraDA  and @mldauber  but so far the AG not concerned with stealing public money and rigging elections that recalled a judge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wondering when you guys will jump into the embezzeling by the DA offices. @SantaClaraDA  and @sanmateoco  being among the worst! And they get far more money to steal!  https://t.co/nUBzGDSpO4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best word choice! Props to the publisher who paid for the ink to print it! @StephenJamesUS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If it is a response to the motion to DQ the private judge, no reply typically comes from the opposing side, a reply comes from the private judge. I want to know if it goes to the superior court or to the Judicial Counsel to be ruled on. 170.3 and all<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JeffRosen is like a born- again politician. He only had his come to Jesus moment on the death penalty when he botched a murder case he had prosecuted as a death penalty case two weeks before his big awakening. #Indictment not #recall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KQED stop being lazy. These are not the people you need to be interviewing. These are the people responsible for the criminal justice culture in Santa Clara County courts and jails.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's see... @Jeffrosen is a terrible prosecutor, a corrupt politician and turns out can't pull when it comes to his big live stream YouTube videos. Not time to get recalled, time to get indicted!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crossed the line when he went to Gilroy to  copsplain. Mr. Rosen doesn't want to talk about that the family law case at the root of this tragedy,  or about  Gilroy's mayor being responsible, in part, for the death of a teen who died from an alcohol related death at his home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Common @KQEDnews  stop with the stenographic journalism and start doing the real work needed to investigate a corrupt DA. Mr. Rosen is responsible for the culture marching in America's streets and MSM thinks he is the one to give the answers as to how to fix it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is Mr. Rosen starting to realize nobody cares what he has to say at these bogus press conferences except corrupt publishers who forgot what journalism is supposed to look like!  https://t.co/Z2STR2msow<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Funny @Jeff_Rosen  is acting as if this is an outrage, his buddy, James Towery has been engaging in far worse conduct since he was involved in the FACEBOOK case the very same year he represented Rosen.

<|startoftext|>Ahh- old private judge corruption. Disclose or not, the private judge did not post his cases in the court as California Rules of Court 2. 834 requires. Too much secrecy - So much corruption. This is the privatization of our courts.  https://t.co/rNzJ7N0OBw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Until &amp; unless Defendants, Crime Victims, Criminal Defense lawyers &amp; civil rights attorneys start sharing police misconduct issues in individual cases, reform will never be possible. Who has these Santa Clara Sheriffs? @LeahGillisLaw @thesajidakhan @BrendonWoodsPD @GackleReport  https://t.co/CrRXLrX4PY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't forget hope! This impacts everyone these days and losing connections to love and hope is fatal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look for the malpractice cases, they are very revealing. Most lawyers settle them out before the real dirt, and discovery comes out! The media must stop buddying up to lawyers who have financial interests in these cases!  https://t.co/sJrv9rD4so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Angelina Jolie had to pay millions to try to remove the private judge in her divorce case. Apparently my going in to  ask about private judging is far more effective. Dirty lawyers seem to be more worried about what I am doing than the law!  https://t.co/p0NOaFgNAA  https://t.co/HJlEzwAWxo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Until we deal with the threats everyone faces for coming forward , not going to get very far. It is like threatening to tell someone's mom, but the mom will never do anything about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, it sounds like he needed help for alcohol and got the good ole boy  group. But she had a lawyer who put her in private judging and should have disclosed what that meant. These lawyers know what is being disclosed and what is not. It is a big game we, &amp; the children, pay for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DA #Jeff #Rosen - everyone's villain. Dark. Deceptive. Dishonest. Even looks like the stereotypic villain from an old movie. Investigating him his like investigating Batman; seems like he is doing something good, but always a feeling that you are witnessing pure evil.  https://t.co/r3578541Iw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fascination with celerity relationships will likely never wane.  Every journalist, and parent should remember the six kids watching. Divorce is not about who is right or wrong, it is about the law. Private judges are the cornerstone of court corruption. That should be the focus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pattern and Practice of #PrivateJudges- if you are trying to figure out what #AngelinaJolie is complaining about in her divorce to #BradPitt, here is the video I did on private judging. These private judges are criminals, fact not opinion.    https://t.co/L8fjAZcnRd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is terrific!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BTW: This is the blog the judges do not want you to see. It is also the blog folks should read up on a judge in your case. Judges rarely follow the law these days. It is a sad erosion of the integrity of the judiciary.  https://t.co/0EeTV0kNHT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone who ever tells a child not to speak with their parents is more likely than not a big problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IRE_NICAR " Little Blonde Kidnap Victim" actually means the media will cover cases of white kids to sell papers and ads, but  Black, Brown and Asian kids are SOL. We have the truth, and not as @Jeff_Rosen would tell it. #AudrieandDaisy @netflix  https://t.co/HUieP8BnrQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good, you have a white collar crime involving a bunch of corrupt family law attorneys acting in bogus private judge cases. Been sitting there since @SFPD report was filed 1-13-2020. Here is your opportunity! #GarretDailey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mldauber should have been fired by @Stanford - she incited hate, violated the First Amendment Rights of protestors who opposed the recall and all while teaching " constitutional law" to students and some dumb DDAs #LuisRamos<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mldauber  wasn't concerned about pedos,  or domestic violence, #NehaRastogi. Dauber  was set on getting justice for one victim and covering up her own issues she has been projecting like an old Super 8 movie your parents made you watch over and over!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOL!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, in the DQ motion SOME cases are disclosed, but not all. Guess that is an improvement because the poor and middle class folks don't even get SOME of the disclosures<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not solving the problem and not close to enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They should, but they won't - it took an out of area lawyer to do it. They don't eat their own, only others who feed their enterprise!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can you please email me details about this : GilroyBassi@Gmail.com<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Let's talk her private judge!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AngelinaJolie and #BradPitt- Private judging is not a rich person problem. This is as corrupt as the privatization of our criminal courts. Stop feeding the corruption at the expense of your children's future.  https://t.co/MwbtGoDzzO<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>WOW Sammy, do you think just once you might sit down and have a real conversation with @Google  and the other tech giants about the financial problems your leadership has caused San Jose families?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Requested  public records related to the financial costs of the 2018 campaign to recall Judge Aaron Persky, I got 6000 emails. Then I looked at the overtime these prosecutors billed taxpayers after giving @mldauber resources  during the business day, for free. Guess what?  https://t.co/OIm8K2Yvkt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>None of it is justified. But you can't fix things going forward, or learn to report properly unless you cover both sides and stay open to listening for the truth. Not just what you are told in a $10 million @netflix  movie project!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOL as a grandma, that is just cruel. Hilarious, but cruel !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously not what they are saying in Silicon Valley where they are the new media and where a corrupt @SantaClaraDA  has been working on rigging the local elections since he did it back in 2018~<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juliasulek this is Michael Lazarin, Audrie Pott's real dad. Can't understand loss of trust in the media, or  racism  until you reflect on the role your reporting played in legal outcomes. " The Little Blonde Kidnap Story" may sell papers , it does not maintain public trust.  https://t.co/olmTQC8zBi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Keep rocking the flowers ! Don't let them see you conform to boring politically correct masks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenKamalaHarris  may not know what it is like to be  a single mom, but she knows how important single moms are.  Hopefully she will make the world better for single moms of all colors.  Harris still should have prosecuted @Jeff_Rosen for what he did to the moms as @SantaClaraDA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjpdchief  this is the natural and probably consequence of you not doing your job and your officers not writing reports consistent with the truth! @sliccardo  that is how it is connected Sammy, and you are the target of this investigation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SantaClaraDA  demanded $2,131 for a crack in this counter while a victim demanded protection afforded under Marsy's Law. We are checking @Jeff_Rosen 's  math ! I expect a charge for leaning on this counter! @GackleReport @robertsalonga @pulcrano @DavisVanguard @radleybalko  https://t.co/vc3jAXrHRr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If @GavinNewsom  can cheat on his wife with a campaign manager's wife and become CA Gov -@SenKamalaHarris can have  a flaming affair with Willie Brown, while he is married -@realDonaldTrump  can settle out and silence his indiscretions, 2020=outrage fatigue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think: Just because you eat carrots for breakfast and die in a car accident,  doesn't mean carrots cause car accidents. If you ignore what else happened for 8 days before she died, you haven't found the truth. She was horribly abused by her parents and a family court system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When @SenKamalaHarris  was first elected, she investigated @SantaClaraDA for public corruption. Jeff Rosen was kicking back overtime pay to those who were loyal to his political campaign. Harris only made Rosen pay it back. Anyone else would have done 30 years in prison.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always love the @FOIA requests to get this information!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When we say " unacceptable" and do nothing , we actually make it " acceptable".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How about calling  out  election rigging in #SiliconValley involving the @SantaClaraDA - remember that is the one as AG , @SenKamalaHarris  let get away with stealing public funds in overtime pay to his supporters. Public Corruption wasn't a priority back in the day  apparently!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is an appropriate subject matter - Ms. Harris has the power to do something about it, why hasn't she?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Being a mother is the hardest job in the world. Neither @realDonaldTrump nor @SenKamalaHarris  have any jurisdiction over this subject matter. Best I can tell, @Jillbiden46 is the only one in WH discussions with subject matter jurisdiction here. Being a mom is color blind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wonder if @KamalaHarris will be discussing families being separated in our family courts with the same passion she took on @realDonaldTrump  on the border issues! If not, not much will change for California Families who have been ignored for decades.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Audrie's "thoughts" scripted by the producers. Psyche reports 2 years earlier show she had very abusive stepparents and endured years of abuse. The  boys had been friends with her for years. Anon because they were minors. Stepparents got $3 million-  that was never in the movie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FOIA of the day. Think globally, act locally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have a soft spot for lawyers who become terrific journalists! @josephtullylaw @thesajidakhan @SanQuentinNews @JoaquinValley @ScottHech @LeahGillisLaw  @chesaboudin  Rest assured @Jeff_Rosen  is no journalist. He has others try his cases in the media!  https://t.co/x30RkjdUUR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#1 reason I did this video was to show how law enforcement and prosecutors use words to rig cases. The ticket saying I was " Non- compliant" admissible in court. The video of the cops saying I was cooperative is not, without some terrific lawyering.  https://t.co/ZBLhc2h8EA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@netflix  reportedly paid $10 million for this movie. Audrie Potts stepparents additionally were paid over $3 million in civil suits and undisclosed donations given to the Audrie Pott Foundation, but did not give Audrie a headstone until the media was going to report on that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Instead of rote recitals when reporting on suicide, it is time reporters start digging and stop leading the narrative. @RollingStone we   conducting an open investigation into Audrie Pott suicide for ethical reporting. Don't forget your errors in Virginia!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are conducting an open investigation of the Audrie Pott case. Some of the kids involved were cop kids and interested to learn if that impacts how folks feel: Email me if you would like to weigh in: LosGatosBassi@Gmail.com<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We are investigating this case. Am interested in how you learned that the defendants were given privacy in the Audrie Pott case?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Poynter  hope your new project will reflect on what reporters did cover and why they missed the sheer outrage folks have when it comes to cops and our legal system.

<|startoftext|>Great photos!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom time to learn  math.  For over 3 mos. , court staff was paid  full salary while courts were shuttered and court users could not collect EDD.

<|startoftext|>Love our firefighters, but you have to do something about the police not reporting fire hazards!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>5/5- favorite part of  criminal file shows him not being able to hang with the Russians he was having drinks with at #Mecals.

<|startoftext|>4/5 Odd  @pulcrano didn't realize he acted with #whiteentitlement after he:  1. Tried to out run a cop 2. Reached into his car and was not shot and killed by the cop.  3.

<|startoftext|>2/5 @pulcrano may not have known what an ex parte was when he was busted for a DUI in 2010, but he knew enough to hire @SteveClark as his criminal defense lawyer. Clark formerly worked for the DAO and was an insider.  https://t.co/wy4dbQ7duD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pulcrano  told me he would put his DUI criminal files online for the public to judge as my criminal recoding the photo case was advanced by the local DA for 3 years.

<|startoftext|>This is good reporting ! Keep digging - we have a very deep rabbit hole because of our lack of reporting on these issues for years. The noise was there, we just were not listening as we should have been.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny @pulcrano  outraged on national level, but on a local level didn't seem to worry his pretty little head that @Jeff_Rosen  @mldauber  and countless members of the @SantaClaraDA were rigging the local elections and feeding him fake news. That he paid for the ink to publish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Investigating courts and cops: most of the noise claims injustice is  " gender" or " race" related .  It's neither, it is pure corruption that persists because those in the system charged with public protection are either - complicit, indifferent or incompetent.   Which are You?  https://t.co/qAA0S9HHJs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you, I spoke with a retired teacher who told me there was a #LarryPott sighting near @saratoga_high  and Larry was banging on windows and flipping the bird. He is the fake father involved in the @AudriePottFoundation- asked if anyone got that on video- nope! Please record!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is more true than you know. Much of our work looks into that. If a prosecutor has mommy or daddy issues ( @Jeff_Rosen ) they tend to project those issues on the culture of their office and prosecutions. Can only wonder what @jeffreisig has buried in his childhood.......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SF comes through again, may be there is hope in the Rule of Law!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chesaboudin  is tackling proactive reform steps in his publishing. @Jeff_Rosen  is setting up the Sheriff to divert attention from his own #FPPC problems. @nbcbayarea  got leaked Grand Jury info last week- the stage set for @mercnews to start protecting Rosen's political career.  https://t.co/LTIRuXheYv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a politically motivated narrative - Why is @SantaClaraDA not talking about public corruption in Victim Witness Services, Corruption in the courts or the trip to Selma 15 prosecutors took while failing to address racism here? Shame on Jeff Rosen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, it is very damaging ! It it reckless and selfish and it leads to distrust and that is where we are these days!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bottom line: Brock Turner probably was a victim of a sophisticated scheme @Jeff_Rosen  used to get re-elected.  Countless victims were ignored by Rosen and more botched cases than cases that actually sought the truth. 10 year pattern equals public corruption.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pattern:  Cheat Taxpayers- AG Let's You Go.  Audrie Pott Fraud (Dead  or Unconscious Victims are the only ones who @Jeff_Rosen  seeks justice for).

<|startoftext|>Open Source Investigation: Any students  or reporters who attended these classes with @mldauber  and members of the @SantaClaraDA  during the prosecution of Brock Turner and related recall of Judge Aaron Persky. @Stanford @SJSU  https://t.co/28vM9Un47m<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really should have moved to Canada when I had the chance!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First Cameras Came for the Cops. Now time for reporters are digging deeper to bring transparency to the  lawyers, judges and public officials. Seems victims of injustice kept the receipts. Or at least the emails! @mercnews @mercnewsguild @SJSpotlight @sanjoseinside  https://t.co/Lz95vjNfPX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is understandable, maybe allow college kids forced to stay home this fall an opportunity to step up and do it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or , with all the @Stanford students paying full tuition to attend classes ' online" they can figure out if it is better to spend $355,000 a year to keep kids in prison or educate kids already here for free !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AudiePottFoundation used fake news to make money off this girls death, then they became the cyberbullies. https://t.co/2AttZOKT4l<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No it was the covered up domestic violence that led to it. The fake parents made $2 million bucks on that story. Case law just took time to catch up to social media  https://t.co/2AttZOKT4l<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Careful of the stories you tell. False ones set real victims back!  https://t.co/2AttZOKT4l<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It really wasn't as difficult as we all thought. The parents did it to cover up real estate fraud , domestic violence and to get a $2 million civil judgment- stay tuned we will show you the real story!  https://t.co/2AttZOKT4l<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you know the parents rigged it with the local DA to get the @netflix  movie and a $2 million settlement?  https://t.co/2AttZOKT4l<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Close your eyes and then imagine this is your son @mldauber  - that is what you incited when you projected anger and guilt in your own life on #BrockTurner. Cancer is not an excuse for what you and Jennifer Bradanini did !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peterthiel it isn't rocket science, or even a complex code, it is a DA trying to play grown up corruption and burying the secrets in the family court. Outside or in, these divorce cases carry the dirty little secrets.  https://t.co/sd7IqaCkOj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe we say these words so often, we are desensitized to what those words really mean.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>$335,000/yr to keep kids in prison.   $50,000/yr to put them in college, and they are out in 4 years with skills they need for life.

<|startoftext|>2011: @CaStateAuditor said courts should not be appointing attorneys for children as a rubber- stamp to  make money for lawyers. 2020: @SCSCourt Judge McCracken,  a former @SantaClaraDA,   appointed an attorney being prosecuted for felony crimes to represent a kid.  https://t.co/Y6oNiktppP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WhiteCollarCrime. Racism most effective not by emptying the jails , but by filling them with white men and women who have been given a pass for too long. Jenny Higgins Bradanini @SantaClaraDA  took 8 months to charge.    https://t.co/gX1Csa2uB5<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>WOW talk about an education not online! 2020 is the era of the unimaginable!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nor to Dems in Silicon Valley who actually were rigging elections ( @mldauber) #PublicRecords!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And @SantaClaraDA  @Jeff_Rosen plans to continue to protect bad cops and public corruption. What is the difference?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PSSST in case you didn't notice, courts are on the list of systems no longer functioning. You just didn't know there was a list!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time to realize we just live in everything fake! This guy though tops the list!  https://t.co/YZvSmnKFvB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These orders are issued everyday in family court!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@grace_hase  reporting on  @mldauber buddy and #metoo organizer who was  charged with vehicular manslaughter 8 months after she killed a 66 year-old man in @LGMSPolice . We will watch this case to make sure #DAKaren doesn't rig it.  https://t.co/gX1Csa2uB5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saw a cop filming me on his personal phone during an arrest I recorded on a public sidewalk.  Told him to save the photo. Then  included it in my CPRA on the police protests. Turns out @LGMSPolice Officer Kevin Baughn should leave photography to the pros! @JasonLeopold  https://t.co/BG3ti2y61K<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Keep in mind, this is " documented" misconduct. We are investigating the misconduct that is not documented by a police department. Mainly the divorce and custody cases of police officers where domestic violence and child abuse is alleged. @chesaboudin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every day. All day !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did you know the @NFL hired consultants back in 2014 to cover this up. Let me dig out the documents. Email me if anyone suing the @NFL needs them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Note: Took @SantaClaraDA  5 years to prosecute this case. Meanwhile countless other 49ers bought their way out. This crime was committed in the same year as Brock Turner, making @SantaClaraDA  not so touch on crime after all!  Sad the victim had to wait 5 years for this moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Criminal Justice Reform Does Not Mean Setting Rapists Free: Victims are outraged!  @Jeff_Rosen failed to prosecute countless sexual violence cases  involving 49ers,  then took 5- years to prosecute #DanaStubblefield while Brock Turner got fast tracked and Rosen  got  re-elected.  https://t.co/pbWqM7vEDR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rest of the story is that this happened at the exact same time as several other 49er cases. My sources are pouring out today to point that out. Why did it take the @SantaClaraDA five years to get justice for this victim? So many others ignored or protected @Jeff_Rosen #Towery<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She is right. Protesting is a fundamental right. Vandalizing the homes of public officials and killing their children is not protected by the First Amendment. Lawlessness is not the answer to corruption!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That wasn't the question asked. Protestors across the country are now going to the homes of public officials. @LibbySchaaf  had her home vandalized and a judge had a son killed.  It  was a fair question. This is a controversial time.  Lawyers call that answer " Non- Responsive" .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Asking . Got an AI guy , need more help. You know Apple Blogger case law?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thanks for the photos. Good to have eyes there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DAKaren is only going to oversee how much money he can raise from voters. Save your money in donations, we are going for indictments all around. That is how we know we did our job!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NancySkinnerCA  gave us SB1421. Pitches Motion. Pull their divorce files and talk to their ex wives, grown children and neighbors. Check Google Scholar to see if the police officer names come up in old case law. Sources in the associations can point you to social media names.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait you think they will account for any of it?  Only accounting they are doing is adding up how much they made by privatizing it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I watched and heard a reporter ask an excellent question about how @GavinNewsom  feels about protestors being chained to a fence in protest outside his home. He didn't answer and shame on the reporter for not following up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom  should be be a spokesperson for second chances. His personal indiscretions were forgiven by @kimguilfoyle &amp; CA voters. Maddening he won't address corruption in CA family and criminal courts, especially after he was afforded the use of a private judge himself.  https://t.co/XCYDVvTffM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Opinion writers are getting some heat these days.  @radleybalko   started an important conversation. Keep raising the bar until it is back where it belongs!  Best folks I know are journalists and lawyers. They are very good at their jobs!  @josephtullylaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going to need reporters on board. Going to prosecutors and  good cops willing to stand up to change the cop culture. It is a big job. Looks like plenty of folks stepping up to do it.  @LeahGillisLaw @chesaboudin @thesajidakhan @ScottHech @TracieOlsonPD @DavisVanguard @radleybalko<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To avoid the appearance of stenographic journalism,  @nytimes  reach out to  @Jeff_Rosen and ask  about cops who lie in court. Also re-check reporting on Brock Turner case and related recall of Judge Aaron Persky. I got the  @mldauber emails for anyone who wants to do their job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry, the stigma persists. Why do we call prosecutors: The People ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When in my 50s,  I landed in divorce court. Judge ordered me to see  Tim Harper, a "vocational"  examiner.  Someone said it seemed as if all Harper thought I was qualified to do was be a " fluffer". I didn't know what a fluffer was. Seems they should be teaching this in school!  https://t.co/llQhob4VJf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time to start looking at white collar crime and public corruption cases. DAs can literally change the game if they do this!  Do love how @chesaboudin  defends against the trolls. Come on #ChesaBoudin, have seen your First Amendment audits, don't get distracted!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wasn't  concerned about sending the DOJ to investigate the 2018 election the @SantaClaraDA #JeffRosen appears to have rigged. So now he wants to whine?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you are not getting arrested or attacked on Twitter by the trolls protecting the subject of your investigation these days, you aren't doing your job as a journalist. Don't whine. Head Down. Get to work! Right @KillerMartinis ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When a DA Cheats: Crime Victims lose  as do the innocent.  @SantaClaraDA  @Jeff_Rosen  and his DDA cheated. They tried the Brock Turner case  in the media to get Rosen re-elected.

<|startoftext|>Folks on YouTube known as " First Amendment Auditors " and " Cop Watchers" have been mocking the police long before the death of George Floyd. It is much more effective. No cop wants to be on any YouTube channel!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Your worries are legitimate so we work on that next - First Amendment Auditors and Cop Watchers are the most important photojournalists we have. They need lawyers , or public defenders willing to step up to protect them as if they are the @NYT<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Harnessing @JasonLeopold  I asked for an additional production on my California Public Records request to @SantaClaraDA .

<|startoftext|>I saw it, reminded me of trying to explain it to Judge James Towery, Judge Mark Pierce,  Judge Julie Emede, Judge Eric Geffon, Justice Mary Greenwood, Judge Vincent Chiarello, Judge Patricia Lucas, and Judge Drew Takaichi, they haven't caught up, but they will!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We really need reports at this point?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Justice We Pay For: Do the Math. IDO attorney @LeahGillisLaw  gets this. My ex  paid his divorce lawyer $1 million. @Jeff_Rosen  $500K a year.

<|startoftext|>Love when the moms start taking names and kicking ass!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Newspapers have been " endorsing" DAs and politicians for decades. Now they want to attack the reporters for doing the same.  Keep writing @radleybalko.  You are a terrific  investigative reporter. Your work is important, and valued!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh you are dealing with a mom! There will be consequences and not just fees. If anyone ever wanted to bet on @Jeff_Rosen  getting indicted, disbarred and stripped of his pension, odds are pretty favorable!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OCDAToddSpitzer , just like @Jeff_Rosen  promised voters they would do it differently. They didn't. @SantaClaraDA  uses snitches too, they just don't get coverage in the @mercnews because #DAKaren has that covered!  https://t.co/RhSeuxseT5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shit is gettin  real! @chesaboudin - SF's New Sheriff in town?  Hey #DAKaren, this is what a DA is supposed to look like! @thesajidakhan @TracieOlsonPD @ScottHech @DavisVanguard @LeahGillisLaw @BrendonWoodsPD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Police officer arrests appear to be directly correlated to public pressure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember when mom said " I am going to start counting" ? I shaped up before 3. Not really sure what would have happened at 4, but gotta wonder what number his mom got to before he began to worry ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chesaboudin  One of these things is not like the others. A few California DAs missing from this conversation! You paying attention @GavinNewsom ? Clean up the DAs and the police issues will follow! @NancySkinnerCA @NancyOMalleyDA1 @Jeff_Rosen @jeffreisig - Thanks @DavisVanguard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOW: There goes #DAKaren again trying to monopolize that Arc thinking he is Noah or  @jeffreisig . DAs have no business bending anything. @DavisVanguard @TracieOlsonPD @thesajidakhan @LeahGillisLaw @radleybalko  this is what a DA looks like as his political career is dying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Copsplaining: As @sjpdchief  @sliccardo come under fire for cops shooting protestors with rubber bullets and not giving up public records, they still want to PR spin in front of a defunding debate. Portland, Oakland and odds on San Jose being next?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeahGillisLaw  @josephtullylaw have the forms to teach how to #CourtWatch in family law cases.

<|startoftext|>Think no DA could be worse than @Jeff_Rosen? Here comes @YoloCountyCA @jeffreisig . If this is not #OutrageousGovernmentConduct nothing ever will be.

<|startoftext|>No bigger question is how did your mom get cool enough to use @WhatsApp ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They called in the moms. Don't think even Trump is going to be able to handle that. My bet is always on the moms! When they work together people have nothing to stop them. Not one of those federal agents wants to splain that to their mom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well we can't go to the bars, but we can smell like them even in a pandemic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOL , my parents just turned on School House Rock. I can still picture that poor little Bill sitting on Capitol Hill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Covering the protests 101: Listen to both sides. Record how the police and press are reporting to the public. That is the only way to preserve public trust in the media. First to hold @LGMSPolice accountable. Today they did a good job! @TownLG  https://t.co/PFzMZre8VR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look out, when the moms are involved, shit is going to get real. Every encounter I have with police I reduce it to what would their mother think?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes it is. " Little Blonde Kidnap Victim", it sells papers and ads. It is a publisher's dirty little secret. Follow the money.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sliccardo  would have us believe San Jose is nothing but @Google , rainbows and roses. Yet he forgets @sjpdchief  shot the testicle off a bias activist and reporters can't get any @SJPD records! Maybe that is reason #284- Give up the records Sam!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOW never heard of a judge ordering something " unfiled". Didn't seem worried about investigating? The clerks who make errors that take children from their parents need to be fired and prosecuted, not just " Unfiled"! @MercedCountyDA  https://t.co/OGxV3UnCAf<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Compassion Fatigue: This is an op-ed in the @LATimes as aggravated and punctuated by a citizen journalist and may be the most powerful reporting on the "mask" debate I have seen all month!  https://t.co/IIWVzAEvh0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing moves around the internet faster than a crooked lawyer's padded bills. This one from @SCCgov  court appointed lawyer @HeatherAllan. She represents the " best interest of the children" for as long as 13 years , or until the money is gone.  https://t.co/GwN9b0CnXm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You are one of the reasons I still  believe in local journalism! @DavisVanguard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Earlier this week I saw local news coverage from @berkeleyside  that the @berkeleypolice  department had been vandalized. So I headed to Berkeley to get some video, public records and interviews. It had all been cleaned up. The vandalized high school a block away had not.  https://t.co/q93cYaW3tY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lawyers often advise their clients to not talk about their case. Waiting until you are convicted is too late. The best lawyers I have had NEVER tell me not to do my job, which is informing the public court the criminal courts, while going through it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One day after the @berkeleypolice  department was vandalized, taxpayers paid to clean it up. Graffiti all over the @BerkleyHighSchool campus remained. Both public buildings in the same city.   #defundingpolice is at issue, #defundingeducation is not. Yet. @berkeleyside  https://t.co/ddQ2iqPaFz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also is in the business of stealing signs from protestors with whom she disagreed during the Recall of Judge Aaron Persky. As a " Constitutional Law Professor " at @Stanford  I found this shocking. University managers &amp; lawyers didn't share that  view.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StanfordDaily reporter on the Brock Turner story told me she had to deal with Santa Clara County Family courts during her parents' divorce. These are the people we have on our team. @MicheleDuaber sold out countless victims to get justice for one. And a book deal!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MicheleDauber  would never agree. She even tried to get out of a criminal subpoena to talk about it. Note: " Tried".<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It is the DAs people !  https://t.co/F6KBjIL1oG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And, the only lawyer we can find Rosen prosecuted is #ValerieHoughton. Rosen has taken 4 years for that case, meanwhile she continues to be appointed to represent kids in court!  https://t.co/F6KBjIL1oG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It isn't just the donations that corrupts Mr. Rosen's office. Have the records for anyone interested. GilroyBassi@Gmail.com  https://t.co/pUD60grJAb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danpulcrano  sure hope you and #DAKaren are up on those #Antitrust laws! Did you mean it when you said you  would post your criminal records online if I posted mine?  I did! @jennwadsworth  @robertsalonga #AldenCapital @RamonaGiwargis  https://t.co/GKaoRlsb38<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone wonder why the divorce lawyers making money by harming kids aren't donating any money? I don't !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are you shocked? Mr. Rosen hasn't prosecuted one case to protect the public in 10 years. He has prosecuted many to protect his political career. @SantaClaraDA  https://t.co/1CM9oadvQI  https://t.co/R4aHluuMR5<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@josephtullylaw One of my favorite criminal defense attorneys/  journalists. He walks the walk. He is almost perfect, just needs a little  adjustment on his  DC v. Marvel stand.

<|startoftext|>LOL . Apparently our modern society will ultimately be judged by the @MaskDebate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good start but does not go far enough. We have interviewed far more cops, their wives and their kids. You can't understand the culture until you look inside the secrecy of the family home where no cameras are watching. Being a " cop's kid" these days sure takes on a new meaning!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very powerful mirror into the soul of our humanity at this point in time! Thank you @DavisVanguard  for your continued coverage!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jk_rowling #CancelCulture has always been around. It has been in the form of #BoyCotts #Protests #Picketing and #Blacklisting. Free speech must me open to  anyone, or it exists for none!  https://t.co/DIxvpiSltM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Free Speech always has a price. Arrest. Canceled or Blacklisted. Trust me it is far safer to have people openly expressing their views than being forced underground where we would have no idea about what is lurking in secret!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As @josephtullylaw  would say, they didn't have a chance from the time they were arrested!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This falls on the culture of the District Attorneys who just don't prosecute white collar crime because those are the criminals donating to their political campaigns! Right @Jeff_Rosen #DAKaren<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who is listening? @chesaboudin @TracieOlsonPD @LeahGillisLaw  @SajidMusicKhan  @BrendonWoodsPD<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Karen in Martinez  also charged. So wondering how long til the public officials and #DAKaren will be prosecuted for their conduct over the past two year period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, even in a global pandemic and unprecedented civil unrest. Mostly just a lack of civility. Little did she know they protected the paint.

<|startoftext|>Hey @sliccardo  instead of worrying about your next TWEET and PR campaign, how is your work on those @SJPD issues coming?  Need help with an actual audit?   Got some cases the  @mercnews was able to find the ink to tell.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pnjaban remember that settlement you did for @SJPD, how compliant are they ? Also time to look at selective informant issues, @SantaClaraDA  using these orders to take out his political adversaries. Hope you will take those cases.

<|startoftext|>This has  grown out of control. We are clearly failing victims based on what we are doing. Real victims are too afraid to speak up and false claims are too protected.

<|startoftext|>I have a Filipino source who came to America for a better life, Los Gatos, CA even.

<|startoftext|>#BLUELIESMATTER  absolutely right and every public defender needs to be able to rip that apart in court. The system is supposed to be fair, transparent and accountable. Let's make it that way! #Zealous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can ask a journalist who knows how to cover the police and the courts. Yes, they lie every time in police reports, and courts., and jurors used to not believe that was possible. #GeorgeFloyd video changed all that. It was made by a 17 year old girl who watched cop videos!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It appears @SantaClaraDA incited so much fear over this protest that the courts were closed and people were left in the jails during a global pandemic caused by the coronavirus. Just think about that! Has Rosen ever issued an apology?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I was 54 before I could understand what the DA could do. I was 56 when I figured out it was what he didn't do that mattered. #Plea=Forfeit  Think how that improves a record to get re-elected. We need it to be #Plea =LossforDA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone know the difference between this baby and my grandbaby who was born about the same time? Think @mariashriver<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ever wonder why a former spouse considered dangerous in family court and  prevented from owning guns under CLETS DVROS  aren't considered dangerous enough to be prosecuted by a local DA?

<|startoftext|>Good, thought it was just me. In @SantaClaraDA  and @SCCgov  they are really confused. Yesterday only half of the 10% of county workers were wearing masks INDOORS.  Feels like they just make up the rules, change the rules and feel no need to follow the rules!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#10- Following the Suicide of #AudriePott Rosen goes in to cultivate inciting fear with his rich white voter base. He terrorizes parents that their children would be cyberbullied. He changed laws, and he got re-elected based on a plea deal that covered up evidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#11- January 2012 Rosen begins testing how to try a rape case in the media. The man got a Factual Finding of Innocence, his wife committed suicide and his children had to drop out of school. @Jeff_Rosen recalibrates and tries again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the same time @Jeff_Rosen  has been the duly elected DA. What does that say about the culture in this county: 2011 Rosen stole taxpayer money to give kickbacks to his staff. I got a dozen more too...... Here I go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait,  really?  If you learned the cops were lying , the DA was cheating and the judge was corrupt or incompetent you should " keep it to yourself".  Is that who is in your foursome on the golf course this holiday weekend!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So do prosecutors and judges. Betcha if a public defender does anything wrong, they have the Bar on speed dial!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is always the defense to conceal police stupidity or incompetence ( PC148) also reduces civil  lawsuits for false arrests!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>" The Judge Found the Cop Credible" That is what our justice system boils down to. A single judge having the power to decide who is " credible" . We have looked for cases of cops being prosecuted for lying in court or filing false police reports ( PC141)- can't find any!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My Grandma was killed by a drunk driver before I was born. Never had much interest in drinking and have donated money to #MADD.

Perhaps journalists and public defenders will start diving a little deeper to do the job #DAKaren didn't do. @thesajidakhan  @radleybalko @ScottHech  https://t.co/p80n0X5FPe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is a culture folks and every news organization that wasn't talking about it now suddenly is. Better pay attention!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People need to understand this impacts crime victims as well. When a crime has been committed, and the victim is poor or of color, they do not get the same treatment from the @SJPD as they would if they were a rich white techie who donates to @sliccardo  and @Jeff_Rosen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FBI better be looking at all the cases, all the DAs who used these cops and start looking at the culture. Start with  @sliccardo @Jeff_Rosen  and @sjpdchief , they created and maintained this culture for their personal and  political advancement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOW  @sliccardo a @BellarmineBells was so  ignorant  he just tried to dot the line to the cop culture and our public  schools.  #GrandmaNancy teaches Special Ed in San Jose CA.  Yes she should be fired and prosecuted for coughing on a baby , but Special Ed should not be defunded!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In 2011  @SJPD killed his wife  after she tried to file for divorce then he  killed himself. The domestic violence and culture of @SJPD has to be addressed better than @sliccardo @Jeff_Rosen  are doing. This culture is on all your duly elected officials @sjpdchief  time to go!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOW Looks like the "rumors" were not rumors and now Mr. Rosen is outraged after attacking Public Defender @thesajidakhan ! And looks like the freelancers, bloggers and YouTubers are reporting what MSM never would! @sliccardo we are adding it up- YOU KNEW!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>California Courts have been closed for months. Reopening but still denying access ! This is our most fundamental right and it appears to be systemic secrecy!  https://t.co/m7YOqFJQ2N<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like the PR folks already on message!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not the only court @cocodefender WTH?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For three months the @SCSCourt  has claimed COVID-19 provides public  records under 10.500 do not have to be produced because it is not an " essential' function of the court. Certainly essential to find out why they closed the courts on June 1, 2020 to everyone!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cop Culture: This report was curated from 2002 @ElDoradoSheriff public records - Officer involved shooting. Investigated by the media, and the cops. No arrests . Qualified immunity is of course an issue, but  the culture of protection is a bigger one.  https://t.co/yVsVcB91gU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@latimes  should absolutely be all over this! This is an election year and it is of public concern why @GeorgeGascon should be so interested in LA following the toxic and deadline police culture in SF under his management and supervision!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do politicians  @LibbySchaaf  want to keep appointing the same folks they know were part of a broken system. Common' Libby do something different. Surprise us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am listening:  @SCCgov  @SusanEllenberg  and other sups paid for an audit that shows nobody is answering the child abuse hotline.

<|startoftext|>Before you vote in your community district attorney races, might want to know the history of the DA you are voting for. @GeorgeGascon  was the DA when @BrianCarmody got attacked for doing his job reporting on the death of #JeffAdachi!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HerbertWingfield Why is the most important information. When you know the why , it is fair for everyone and every one has an equal shot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DAKAREN feels safer and that is all #JeffRosen has ever been concerned about. #Selfserving<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@radleybalko : 80 year old lawyer read your article, in print.. Wait til you see what that lawyer does! This 90 year old read it too  and he has a Twitter account because his son is an investigative journalist! Thanks #FreePressFriday @StephenJamesUS @thesajidakhan @LeahGillisLaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes! Thank you @DavisVangaurd , making this  @UCDavis Alum proud to be a public school kid! Wait til you see what @LeahGillisLaw can do with #DAKaren. She has #freespeech and litigation privilege!  @SCCBarAssn @SantaClaraDA @BrendonWoodsPD  #PublicDefenders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The why is the most important thing to understand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brilliant combo social media and micro local news. How many newspapers or broadcasts did this go on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We  imagine the @SantaClaraDA #DAKAREN  is going to have to have these talks with his own children sooner rather than later. #MamaAlwaysSaid  This book being used in a special investigative series-  #RacismTalks  https://t.co/WzGf3y1se2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SantaClaraDA  #JeffRosen is the First #DAKAREN in AMERICA - that is Check Mate and a win for the #FirstAmendment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SantaClaraDA  #JeffRosen doesn't apologize. He only corrupts the courts, sleeps with a judge and spits on victims while protecting police. Then there is that little problem of how he treats journalists. Dare him to even look east! @radleybalko @LeahGillisLaw  @thesajidakhan<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thank you @GackleReport suspect you know what it looks like when @SantaClaraDA  #JeffRosen abuses his power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Took one article from @radleybalko ,  collective voices of   #PublicDefenders ,  8:46 video made by a 17-year old kid and  brave @SJSU  professors exercising #FirstAmendmentRights to catch #DAKaren Thanks ! @thesajidakhan @LeahGillisLaw @josephtullylaw  https://t.co/Ly6rODEtj1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was it @BrendonWoodsPD who was the first to call @SantaClaraDA #JeffRosen the  first #DAKAREN? Inquiring minds want to know and to interview you for my YouTube channel where I record the police, and corrupt DAs . This one: a little foreshadowing. https://t.co/O0d7DgReQ8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOW ! @SJSU students and professors exposed  Silicon Valley's White Supremacy culture in a recently published #PAINREPORT . @sliccardo  seems to be trying his hand at FAKE NEWS to maintain the police culture that surely even  @BellarmineBells  know is not sustainable in #2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@radleybalko @thesajidakhan  absolutely the best example of how journalism and justice are support to work. Thank you for letting me hitch on that terrific 4 day ride! @LeahGillisLaw @josephtullylaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carolecadwalla  you finally have some folks in Silicon Valley who have your back. How is that lawsuit going that the White Supremist otherwise known as #MarkZuckerberg  brought against you in the UK? Him and his fake #Facebook  News Initiative and all!  https://t.co/mJ8rFhQ3xY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice to imagine what the @SantaClaraDA #JeffRosen and his wife, #JudgeAmberRosen talked to their children about at dinner last night.     Think they finally had the #RacismTalk? @thesajidakhan  @BrendonWoodsPD @SJSUHumanRights  @SJSU @radleybalko @thomas_peele @LeahGillisLaw  https://t.co/YmsMwtGSBG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am going to keep a national list of all the white power positions that suddenly find themselves indicted. Think some white collar criminal defense lawyers are about to get really rich! Looking for volunteers to help keep the list!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't think #AnnRavel supports #BlackLivesMatters - she took #JeffRosen's endorsement and knew what he was up to two years ago, but took it anyway. Know who you are voting for!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SantaClaraDA   incited fear that caused the July 1, 2020 closure of the courts. Can you imagine people being denied or delayed their day in court because a corrupt whiny DA incited fear that resulted in closing courts and canceling hearings? BTW- his wife is a judge !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WANTED:  #localreporting in every community. This took 4 days after @radleybalko  lent a hand to the police- DA connection calling  out @SantaClaraDA and the toxic culture of chilling speech critical of his office.  Thank you to the Public Defenders !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carolecadwalla  you've got company! Today a @SJSU professor issued a report and called out the #SiliconValleyGods for a White Supremacy Culture. How do you like them apples?  https://t.co/HxQpz4O4Rg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump Fatigue Anyone? Today in San Jose a professor was calling out Silicon Valley's White Supremacy culture. #reportlocal , where it matters!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom  San Jose Press Conference promoted by the Public Defenders trying to bring attention to the @SantaClaraDA made their statements in front of the Martin Luther King Jr. Library. The library has been closed since March 16, 2020 due to COVID-19.  https://t.co/sudj02Aguc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeahGillisLaw  once argued  before Judge Geffon that @SantaClaraDA was " hysterical".  #JeffRosen reportedly wrote this after inciting fear and wasting public resources that closed the  DAO and local courts on June 1, 2020. This is criminal. Needs more than another free pass!  https://t.co/AuEWFENBi0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesajidakhan - Rosen's letter  &amp; comments  made at the Public Safety and Justice committee indicate he incited fear to close the county DAO and the courts, on 6-1-2020. BTY , that " Fake" Whistleblower complaint, it is a county risk management program. Thanks @radleybalko  https://t.co/TPDC23NnVw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holding  local district attorneys accountable is the next stop, otherwise it is just rhetoric.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It took @radleybalko  and the @washingtonpost  to report on @SantaClaraDA  - #JeffRosen was finally held accountable. The @mercnews  still giving him a pass - we will keep working. #journalismmatters !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today I attended a press conference where a college professor called Silicon Valley tech moguls "white supremist". Not a leap to politicians such as these. @joesimitian  and politicians like him catering to Silicon Valley #PaloAlto elite... If the shoe fits. @SusanEllenberg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Forgot I wrote that. Would say it again. Still wondering and imagining. Just  like I imagine all the public defenders thinking  WTF when it comes to defending clients in a terribly corrupt criminal justice system where the real bad guys get away every day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pattern and Practice: We continue to investigate corruption @StateBarCA. Since 2010, when #JimTowery became OTC, as his wife #KarynSinunuTowery worked for @SantaClaraDA there has been no meaningful oversight of that office. No review of prosecutorial misconduct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was a small group, but the stories were some of the most outrageous never told. Pattern and practice of @SantaClaraDA  @SCCBarAssn @SCSCourt  are clear. @SusanEllenberg @SupCindyChavez  @DaveCortese @joesimitian and @Mike__Wasserman -  all knew!  https://t.co/yLuzSNQ4dW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Danser Revisited coming there soon. This time we toss in a few DDAs along with the judge and cops!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If a Grand Jury Report about misconduct of the @SantaClaraDA didn't bother duly elected officials back in 2016,  why would duly elected politicians worry about public corruption and misuse of state and federal grant money now?  https://t.co/JPLD6XezTb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When " Systemic Racism" is claimed in reporting.... show what that looks like in the local courts that oversee a county's civil and criminal matters.  https://t.co/rgqMCyzTfO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great job reporting on this. It is shameful what that #ThinBlueLine will do to protect this culture. We saw the @SantaClaraDA  PIO #SeanWebby do that during the Persky recall. #Shamless- Looks like " Frank" to me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You mean this corrupt @SantaClaraDA ? #JeffRosen #prosecutorialmiscondcut the one and only stealing state and federal grants taxpayers intend to assist victims?

<|startoftext|>Yes, that lovely thing. Careful it is so rare we can't find any others for 20 years!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indictments are possible when corruption is not.  https://t.co/is0msBeFkK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think only one judge in Silicon Valley was rigging court cases with cops? All journalist and public defenders interested, I have the entire file from #FOIA almost as complete as @JasonLeopold  would have!  https://t.co/E437Ub1UsV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From a little boy and his grandma whose  story I covered.  @SantaClaraDA #JeffRosen failed this victim and tried to convince the local public otherwise.

<|startoftext|>BUT-  #JeffRosen @SantaClaraDA didn't even get a parking ticket when you caught him stealing public money to help his political campaigns did he @KamalaHarris ? And what did you do to change the cop culture in California when you could? I missed it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crime victims and defendants are united in calling for removal of corrupt DAs. #JeffRosen the @santaClaraDA has failed more victims and prosecuted more people of color while he lets rich white- collar Silicon Valley criminals act with impunity. This is what taxpayers paid him.  https://t.co/iDdHzyx5cy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SantaClaraDA  #JeffRosen filed a declaration saying he was  fearful I might make "physical contact" with him ( I was asking him why he ignored poor victims of color ) . Now requires taxpayers to pay for two bodyguards to protect him. I am 5'4 " 115 pounds, 56 -year-old grandma!  https://t.co/wQTZq62Shs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Am a white woman who had cops break my hand while recording them. Corrupt @SantaClaraDA prosecuted me not the cops. They call me aggressive and vexatious.

<|startoftext|>@LeahGillisLaw  walks the walk! Love what #TheDefenders are doing to take on these powerful DAs . They control the culture in the police, the courts and the community.

<|startoftext|>Don't look at race and retaliation in a bubble. Systemic means everywhere. Look at it more like the Coronavirus!   https://t.co/hO7JKxeZ7H<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sliccardo  then there is this- it was the family courthouse by the way where #JudgeTowery and Jeff's wife are judges. No corruption for anyone to see here I get because Sam Liccardo and @sjpdchief say so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The culture the DA knew about and did nothing about- that is how it is linked to family court @sliccardo  let's keep going shall we ?? #51<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It has to be about outing the DA's who protect the cops and put on false evidence with their testimony!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fake Sales, Fake News, Fake Criminal Justice System , Fake Health Care System, Fake Voting ..... What is next ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you factoring in recovery time that includes areas with documented police brutality's and racists DAs?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What if your name is already #Sue ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SantaClaraDA #JeffRosen is more afraid of the truth than any prosecutor in California's history!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is the small towns where the conversations will matter most. That is where we know one another!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you , we need help with eyes everywhere!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greg_doucette  now turning to the prosecutors and how they protect this police culture. #CamerasinCourt and until then we have #journalism and #Criminaldefense attorneys!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you @radleybalko  and @washingtonpost  - Absolutely right that it is the prosecutors who define our society's police culture. @SantaClaraDA has been in office for 10 years, creating a toxic culture for both victims and defendants. And then there is the grant money....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you for the photos and eyes on the ground - this is literally across the street from my office and I missed it !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If we are doing our homework as reporters, we would know both of those cases were rooted in the county counsel office of @SCCgov  where there is a whole lot of corruption to investigate. A little more local than what Trump is up to !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please speak up about this experience until everyone believes it is not fake news!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#RighttoRecord  in public it matters too. Thank you for the post!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know how they are marching in the streets to reform law enforcement? This is what it looks like when we start marching on social media and when journalism and criminal defense attorneys finally balance out prosecutors and cops who ruin lives for sport!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fastest way to reform police - get rid of corrupt DA's who protect them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOL #Journalism matters. We may not get paid as much as dirty DA's but it is nice when we see a little justice from the front row. BY the way Rosen was written up by the grand jury in 2016 and 2017 for delaying cases. 4 years is short with his record.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you - we need ALL Journalists and Criminal Defenders to speak up and out. DA's such as @SantaClaraDA #JeffRosen are part of a culture that doesn't need reform- it needs planned obsolescence. Mr. Rosen is a racist - I can back that up with court files and his record!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sliccardo Where is that Million dollars? Did it go to cop lunches? Gifts?  Can't find the records you and that dirty DA @SantaClaraDA #JeffRosen seem to be hiding lots of money that never reached the community, or victims!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you @robertsalonga  The @SantaClaraDA  #JeffRosen needs transparency and accountability more than any other prosecutor in the country. He is the greatest threat to public safety in Silicon Valley #Journalismmatters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can you imagine if George Floyd didn't die and was arrested by the @SanJosePD  or @LGMSPolice  then prosecuted by @SantaClaraDA #JeffRosen or #KarynSininuTowery? I can!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>California criminal justice reform activists argue the most important change @GavinNewsom could make to change the CA's police culture is order the #AG to prosecute @SantaClaraDA #JeffRosen  and #ToweryDynasty for stealing state and federal grants. @NorCalInnocence  https://t.co/N96UmqUoIu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is still a nightmare for the #Dreamers whose parents are dealing with the culture of California's family and criminal courts ! @SantaClaraDA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What bill did you propose that was stronger in CA for the 20 years you had the opportunity to do so @KamalaHarris ? I am looking and can't find it ! @chesaboudin  have you found it yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris  as @attorneygeneral is arguably responsible for the culture of racism in the courts and law enforcement agencies across CA. She knew the @SantaClaraDA #JeffRosen was stealing from taxpayers and prosecuting the innocent and she let him go! #JeffRosen 2011<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nor are they taught about the sad reality black/ brown children who sit next to them in school face everyday. #CPS @sjpdchief @sliccardo @SusanEllenberg @SupCindyChavez @joesimitian @SantaClaraDA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or the best way to end a #FOIA  or #CPRA request to a #PIO who is trying to delay , obstruct or redact public records !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting the politicians who advanced their political careers in a culture of racism suddenly have a sense of urgency when it comes to #racialjustice. This mayor's jails are filled with black and brown people who have no idea what that PR tag line means! @sliccardo @sjpdchief<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorCalInnocence @NCIP interesting that the woman behind , or maybe in front , of the Tainted Trials series, married to the @StateBarCA  OTC who did nothing about prosecutorial misconduct that put the innocent in jail and is married to controversial #JudgeTowery would be supported by #NCIP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She brought @SantaClaraDA #JeffRosen  - On her watch, the DAO and local police developed a culture of #racism #Bias and #corruption #JudgeTowery and @sliccardo  that is #1 @SCSCourt @SusanEllenberg @SupCindyChavez<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In @SCSCourt family courts the children of immigrants, these " dreamers" have faced horrible abuses and neglect due to public corruption and obstruction of justice - we have investigated and are reporting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cutting public records staff? Beefing up spending to protect bad police culture ?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>WOW, yes, @SamLiccardo- shall we start with the $1 million San Jose gave to build the new $283 Million family court where more crimes are committed with impunity than any other place in the city?

<|startoftext|>This is why they are marching in the streets.  It is a culture. By my count this man died by one cop who was the shooter and 6 cops who stood by and helped. That is the culture - everyone who was there is responsible.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Email me and I will train an army to get these public records - GiloryBassi@Gmail ( dot ) com. These records should be free and if they are not, I am going to want to know about it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is the culture, and it is stupid to discuss anything else. This is the department that passed around a younger age girl for sex favors. Then @SantaClaraDA  Jeff Rosen got her moved out of state so she could not testify against the officers. Address the culture!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have actually had that thought as well. Picture them sort of like those folks at the Alamo. Of course, that is shut down too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do we not wonder how @sliccardo can get this much in federal funding as @sjpdchief is violating the Civil Rights of the folks protesting police brutality on the streets of San Jose? Hope reporters are getting these records, let's see if San Jose coughs them up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She freakin rocks! MOMS are going to change the world!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ManeAbdallah excellent- thank you for always including the names and contact info for those who are responsible !<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Victory11251943 @sjpdchief No, it passed shameful about 20 years ago!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SJSpotlight @mercnews  had two reporters arrested. We had two photojournalists tear gassed. Guess all those folks on YouTube recording the cops weren't so crazy afterall!  https://t.co/fDVaF89ZUn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greg_doucette absolutely my favorite lawyer in America! These folks who record the police gave us a window to what  the world now sees. Thank you for your work in putting this spreadsheet together!  https://t.co/fDVaF89ZUn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shame on @sjpdchief  - are you serious? 1 officer called a protestor a bitch, he got desk duty. Another officer shot a bias activist in the groin rendering him unlike to have kids.  And this is your solution! WTF- Please retire so we don't have to waste money on your indictment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We all understand when we listen, and try to imagine!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjpdchief and @sliccardo went on @abc7newsbayarea  and other local news to copsplain the conduct of SJPD officers at the George Floyd protests.

<|startoftext|>Don't need to thank me, this is what I do. Here is what good old @sjpdchief  said as the pandemic hit. He said :" it doesn't get any worse than this " and then it did!  https://t.co/q9dUE8bRWi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOW! In a week. Imagine the last 50 years this has been  going on when nobody was filming the cops!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we added you to ours! Thank you !  https://t.co/bY5Juhsoi7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This culture is not a mistake- it is systemic and comes from the top down. Supervisors , DA and Police Chief. No more talk @sjpdchief - this culture has to go, or you #JEFFROSEN and @sliccardo  do! Breaking up the boys club! Look out your window!  https://t.co/bY5Juhsoi7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Waiting for @sjpdchief  and @sliccardo  to start walking the walk - ZERO tolerance for cops who do this! Where are the good @SJPDPIO  cops willing to speak up instead of protecting the culture!  https://t.co/bY5Juhsoi7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Signed and reported on him - spread the video around !   https://t.co/bY5Juhsoi7<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is awesome- bet the 70 didn't loot a single thing from @RahulDubey's house!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And yet the courts that have been closed for two month, remain closed, backlogged and corrupt!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So sorry, they are reopening and seem to not be as concerned about the COVID- 19 threat once the #GeorgeFloydProtests  erupted? Police misconduct and a corrupt local DA (#JeffRosen) are clearly a bigger threat to our community than the coronavirus!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really @sjpdchief ? Future recruits??? What about the ones under your management and supervision now? You didn't get back to me about an interview to review the video I took over the weekend from the SJ #GeorgeFloydProtests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sliccardo  you and Eddie @sjpdchief  are responsible for this culture. The relationship with the DA's office and bad cops is going to take a lot more than you taking a knee with protestors to resolve.  https://t.co/8SYWj2RlFv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't forget , we get to pay for this too. Can you imagine the overtime this is generating as unemployment hits an all time high?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gonna take a lot more to change this culture! All hands on deck. Consider a poll, who is afraid to call the cops!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't help but wonder if we will live vicariously in our pursuit of justice. So many denied and that is what is marching in our streets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Public employees are public employees. FOIA time everyone! You should take every one of these anecdotal stories and make a very long list of FOIAs we will need to request ! @JasonLeopold<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Any video of that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let’s do a tally, we have seen more reporters attacked and harmed by the cops assigned to these protests!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And everything else appears to have been broken too- who knew !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And Santa Clara - imagine some worry about those behind the #THINBLUELINE  and those who protected the police over public trust in our legal system  https://t.co/g1jSY98fPi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really hoping the experiences of journalists will make them mad enough to finally write about it, and their publishers and editors will let them. Folks cop watching on YouTube  have seen this for years!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has been lacking transparency for far too long!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, now the world sees what many of us saw when no cameras were watching.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is very important.  In San Jose I specifically asked and they said the body cams required to on. we know these are being described or edited. Am requesting them everywhere I can !  #publicrecords  All hands on deck !<|endoftext|>
