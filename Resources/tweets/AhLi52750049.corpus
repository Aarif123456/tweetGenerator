<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA @GeoffDuncanGA @GaSecofState Should count the number of mail-in ballots and the number of envelopes. Verify if the numbers match. Verify the signature and only count those with good signature. If the numbers are off to a great %, then should reject all mail-in ballots.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The excuse for not wearing a mask “everyone was tested before that event” doesn’t mean you won’t get infected with COVID in the event. Remember “pregnancy test is not the same as contraception“. Wear a condom if you don’t want any babies, doesn’t matter how many tests you did b4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Look at Hong Kong. Their Tot Cases/1M pop is 681 and Deaths/1M pop is 14, compared to 23037 and 647 respectively in US. That’s because Hongkongers wear mask. Their puppet government never really closes the border between Hong Kong and China. You can see how effective the mask is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You should wear a mask when social distancing is impossible. This way you protect yourself as well as the people around you. You should always do this to set up an example for everyone. If everyone wears a mask, the market can re-open sooner without spike in infection rate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I hope your contraction of COVID humbles you, lets you experience how people suffer and hopefully makes you a better president. Get well soon!<|endoftext|>
