<|startoftext|>The achievements are ridiculous; flat out ridiculous &amp; I wasted time getting Seriously 2.0 so trust me I know a waste of time. I didn’t bother with 3.0 &amp; won’t with 4.0. I actually like playing other games. I loved Gears but I think it’s time the series stops.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a fan of Gears of War 4 &amp; it’s MP. Teams are never balanced at all; can’t seem to make any sense of its ranking system. #Xbox #XboxGamePass personally story did little for me &amp; left me with no interest in 5. I may stream some horde but man Gears 1&amp;3 were better for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I even want this and I’ve all but given up on most of what WWE puts out. Just isn’t for me but Big E is great &amp; this would be awesome.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I wish Rainbow Six Siege was functional &amp; people played it like the game is set up for but nope team death match &amp; people constantly rush spawns easy to memorize if you’ve loved on the game. It’s free on game pass otherwise avoid spending money on it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wolfkingvillian You make me want to move out of CA lol, well the cost does too but the wrestling is the other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DashingChrisBey @ScottieDubbs To be fair she’s objectively very attractive and I mean that with all due respect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog Well that’s like your opinion man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m still shook; met him once when I was 14 &amp; he was the nicest guy. Been a favorite even before that though. He was a HUGE reason TNA got me as early as they did in my fandom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well you being one of the best COMPLETE wrestlers helps I am sure. Then again this is one marks opinion; huge fan since Laurel Van Ness<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ScoutTheBadDog @AOC Says the idiot hiding behind a dog profile picture and using a insult that isn’t even a word, but sure lecture me about intelligence lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This embarrassment helped create this mess; don’t let the rats leave their sinking ship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC Let’s cut congress salary by 35% across the senate and house. Term limits &amp; yes Tac the rich as well as churches appropriately. Billionaires in my opinion shouldn’t exist. No one needs that kinda money no one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SoCal4Trump @RSBNetwork She’s also lying and  drunk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC Let’s actually tax the rich though and not just sell swag. Also churches as well need to be taxed; politics is pay to play and they don’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I ain’t paying no $65 fucking dollars for a stupid ass hoodie. I actually want Rich people taxed &amp; a half assed expensive hoodie isn’t gonna cut it; wish Congress would get the fuck off twitter &amp; do their damn jobs.

<|startoftext|>@AllEliteTiffany My mind is blown; I love how little I read dirt shirts these days so even if I had suspicions on Omega the whole thing shocked me. It was great feeling that way again. Double or Nothing was the last time or Edge’s return.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kelthecelt That’s awesome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you do nothing else today watch @LanceStorm vs @WWEDanielBryan from #ROH I hadn’t seen this one &amp; man it’s good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Maddie_Miller @Chelsea25563518 @TrumperWavin Again I said veterans I know and also served with. The two baby boomer veterans you know do count but they are usually rather uneducated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chelsea25563518 @TrumperWavin Did I say every veteran you know? No I didn’t and did you serve? No ok this again didn’t apply but thanks for reminding me some veterans are dipshits.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WayneDupreeShow 😂 this shit is entertaining I’ll admit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrumperWavin Lmao he definitely didn’t win CA; not a single veteran I know voted for him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marklutchman 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love how dumb these people are, but sad because I know what it’s doing to the country. Lin Wood is a moron &amp; a traitor if he’s advocating sedition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScooterMagruder Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenMcSallyAZ Amazed you supported a draft dodger and a traitor being a combat veteran. I may not have been a pilot or done anything of note but I deployed twice to the Middle East and rim pacs(time away from my kids) So how you ever justified supporting Trump is beyond me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenMcSallyAZ You weren’t even voted in ever; you’re a prime example of why that needs to be changed. I mean how the fuck does it make sense you lose an election and get handed a seat? That shit needs to end immediately<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Its_JustLovely So yeah she’s a goddess and good for her<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am glad I am not the only one thinking this and laughing at Aubrey Huff every time he mentions something “manly”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously. The fact he bred worries me already but that’s all I say involving his kids. I wonder how “Manly” it is to raise 2 kids solo as I have been doing for well over 5yrs now. (14Boy&amp;10Girl) I also served my country so I wonder if that is “manly” enough too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boy, this guy is pathetic on a level that I didn’t think could be reached. His constant need to be considered a “Man” has to be mentally exhausting for his kids &amp; anyone who deals with him off of twitter. I mean you really suck as a person if this is how you spend your retirement<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therecount @PeterHamby know what is isn’t snappy? Cutting reenlistment bonuses like your administration did. The drone strikes, bailing out wall street, Flint etc. I don’t give 2 shits what he thinks is “snappy” Trump is the worst President we’ve ever had but Obama gets a pass on too much same on Bush<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politico I’ll be straight up don’t give a flying fuck about his opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @stevenmnuchin1 all you had to do was google her and you wouldn’t look as stupid as you do right now. I mean Jesus Christ this guy is so dumb it’s crippled the country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Austin Aries maybe.....well you know off a bit, but man is this match vs CM Punk good. It’s The Title match in #ROH before Punk went to #WWE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also Phantom Thread was something else. Paul Thomas Anderson is a master of his craft #movies<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@familyfooddude @Oreo @ladygaga I saw her live one time as a Navy buddy needed someone to go with &amp; I was like fuck it; how out of place could I be? Well ALOT lol it was a spectacle &amp; really good I have to admit. I had so much glitter on me for weeks after that show, and I wasn’t even wearing any.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He is right but I also haven’t forgotten Williams lying ass about that rocket fire. It’s the same shit Clinton did but of course liberals always give them a pass on this  &amp; it’s why veterans I know refuse to vote Democrat. Republicans aren’t any better but come on fuck Williams<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awesome in my opinion<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IGN Why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dnellicious Samoa Joe in TNA is money so much good stuff there. It’s why it pisses me off seeing what WWE has done with him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The biggest fucking crime @WWE has done #WWE #WWERaw #SmackDown both shows is not giving Samoa Joe a WWE Title run. He’s absolutely incredible &amp; a beast. This is just a taste go look up his #ROH stuff too. Dude is definition of killer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealNickAldis I just learned he was the person behind HBK vs Angle and if that’s true makes him even more of a legend then he was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awesome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fayejackson419  https://t.co/e2h7urfTrZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RexChapman He has no credibility with veterans even if he’s right here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here’s your daily reminder #WrestlingCommunity #WrestlingTwitter go watch @RealKurtAngle vs @ShawnMichaels #WWE #WrestleMania 21 I was told the match was Pat Patterson’s which isn’t something I knew. Anyways it’s one of my favorites ever &amp; the re-match to it was just as good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 Because they aren’t credible and it’s not in a court of law so keep trying to spin this lame ass propaganda. I almost pity your supporters for be conned by a wannabe Ken Barbie doll.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 I left the party years ago but not because of that. It’s cult now and a religious one. There isn’t a place for Atheists in the GOP. Then same goes for the DNC too.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PhoenixAEW @WrestleJoy Seems like she covered it lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If in a far off dream I could get @RealKurtAngle vs @KennyOmegamanX I’d pay $75 for that match alone on a PPV. #AEW could give Angle the last match worthy of him. I need that Corbin thing erased from memory. Just watched Benoit vs Angle on WM17 really good but RR03 is the money<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Now my son asks me Dad what’s your all time favorite PPV. It’s a typical answer but I’m 34 &amp; this event was built to perfection. #WWE #WrestleMania X-7 it’s just a perfect PPV. I don’t think he realizes it’s 3hr 45mins 😂 but it’s so good he probably won’t even realize it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Un fucking believable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Requested A Rollins match and I haven’t seen this more then twice. Live &amp; some time after again so it’s still just as good as I remember it being #WWE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally got my son to watch some wrestling willingly lol. He is 14 and #WWE turned him off after No Mercy with Lesnar &amp; Strowman. He’s watched some #WWENXT #NXT &amp; went to #WarGames in LA with me but it’s been scarce since. Rollins vs Balor vs Miz for the IC Title since he...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HeyHeyItsConrad  https://t.co/2p37kCrJox<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DestinyFomo Damn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cmclymer He lied about being under fire; he can go fuck himself like Clinton with that sniper fire bullshit. The idolization of the media on both sides is disturbing. I just don’t get why people about this clown going off on another clown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tucker Carlson is an idiot racist who appears intelligent to those who are rather uneducated? Shocked just utterly shocked at this revelation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhoenixAEW Nyla Rose, Hikaru Shida, Big Swole, Kris Statlander, Anna Jay off the top of my head<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeyHeyItsConrad What about your wife? Lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump lol you lost bitch get out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s the sad part of religious people like her. Their mistakes or evil doesn’t matter because their God will forgive him. It’s people like her that have made me the Atheist I am. The Trump supporters know exactly what they are doing;especially the educated ones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec doesn’t care that she’s lying; you can read her body language. She knows what’s she’s doing; as for the cross sure she’s a typical hypocrite of the religious right but that’s to be expected. She thinks she can just ask for forgiveness on all she’s done &amp; boom she’s good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let’s not forget @GavinNewsom tired of rich people. #EatTheRich<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@xcircusgirl @YNB Well you’re part of the reason trump is there then own it. She’s a liar and to veterans like me lying about sniper fire in Bosnia makes you a shit person. Voted for Iraq war and shit sec of state but sure keep defending her I’m sure you’ll win over the moderates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FiteTV @IMPACTWRESTLING Gail Kim for me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thor_benson He knows and he doesn’t care; it’s about power and what he can grab. Being a veteran myself I am beyond embarrassed by people like Crenshaw and Cotton.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dan Crenshaw and Ivanka Trump are a joke. The media would do well to not amplify them. I am a nobody not amplifying shit. Both know what they are doing &amp; it’s why they are traitors to me. Especially when you swore an oath Crenshaw; you know better and put spouting bullshit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump You left out the proud boys as usual. Funny how you are literally doing the thing you accuse the media of doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Andy Ngo is what happens when half an education meets social media. I mean if I had no sense of morality I’d edit shit all the time and make bank. I often wonder how so many could buy his BS half assed propaganda. Then I remember 70 million voted Trump.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IlhanMN Start by removing the corporate Democrats who do nothing for us. Oh wait people keep voting them in just like the Republicans. I won’t hold my breath especially as a veteran who gets comp. I know all too well the promises the government makes and NEVER keeps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonvoight You’re embarrassing yourself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexaBliss_WWE @RyanCabrera Congratulations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YNB The problem is no one wanted her there. The cult like following of Trump is eerily similar to that of Clinton. People supporting her are more apart of the problem then those that don’t. I could go for hours on why she lost &amp; not even touch the email BS.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DanCrenshawTX You being a Former Seal and you not being able to tell this is edited &amp; propaganda worries me deeply. Both sides are starting shit &amp; using editing it’s not hard to see what happening. Stop acting like your party has the moral high ground that’s a joke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These violent delights have violent ends And in their triump die, like fire and powder Which, as they kiss, consume  Shakespeare’s Romeo &amp; Juliet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“His nature is too noble for the world: He would not flatter Neptune for his trident, Or Jove for’s power to thunder. His heart’s his mouth: What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent; And, being angry, does forget that ever He heard the name of Death.” Menenius<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“Why did you wish me milder? Would you have me False to my nature? Rather say I play the man I am.” Coriolanus, Act 3, Scene 2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching Romeo &amp; Juliet and if you’re my age (34) or younger you should know the one I am watching. It’s honestly my favorite adaptation of Shakespeare’s work to film. Though Coriolanus was fantastical as well. #Hulu<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Like they fucking give a shit; being a veteran whose 100% I’ve learned when and where the government actually helps. This usually isn’t one of those areas.

<|startoftext|>I’ll be honest I don’t want to see Shaq on any wrestling show for any reason. My only complaint about the show this week would be this. I enjoyed her &amp; Brandi but Shaq being mentioned implies he’s coming &amp; nah no thanks. We will see I’ll reserve serious judgment till it plays out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Loving #AEW #AEWDyamite #AEWonTNT I am no expert nor do I pretend to be. I’m just someone whose loved wrestling their whole life &amp; this is what I love to see as a complete show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I mean the rematch for a trilogy could be the PPV, but it will be good one way or the other #AEW #AEWonTNT<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Seriously a great match and Christian’s TNA run isn’t respected as it should be. So much good stuff at that time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is no justice for victims in this country anymore. This sickens me; I’d move the fuck out of the state but that’s not always so easy. Unbelievable how bad the courts fucked up here.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I’m done with twitter today. People on here are obnoxious and Americans self entitlement is not something I want to deal with today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Menacing_Mars I also served with a lot of men &amp; women I’d take a bullet for. Don’t even think for a second my perspective comes solely for my skin color. I know white people have ALOT issues especially with race &amp; locking up black men for dumb ass shit. I’ve been in the car see. It first hand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Menacing_Mars I know what it is and you entitled to your own opinions not your own facts.  Again reform is absolutely necessary even defunding in some cases. You trying to adjust a word‘a definition to make your point doesn’t make you educated. I never once mentioned anything European so 👍🏻<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Please Georgia save us since our country or 70 million people have lost their damn minds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Faith___C @TakesGuy @noname Im not about to start the definition of words game some liberals or conservatives like to play. I said my piece and I’m out of this conversation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Faith___C @noname That’s why I said execute them; especially clear cut cases like Dylan Roof &amp; Charles Manson. Granted Manson is dead now but should have been killed yrs ago. If we are getting rid of prisons then capital punishment needs to be fine tuned because it does have issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ginger Jesus sees all. He will remember when he comes to rapture his flock.  https://t.co/fddvChd0A8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/2lA6Ua1lKP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Menacing_Mars I understand what your getting at &amp; still reform is to amend or alter basically. Abolish is different; I don’t get get Gen Z &amp; their insistence on changing what words actually mean just to try &amp; make an “educated opinion”. I’m for reform of course; change needs to be made.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carlzimmer Very stable genius<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thunderrosa22 @tcbinla  https://t.co/2DjWtrWxhr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noname No we don’t; reform yes. Unless we start executing rapists, child molesters, murderers or other violent crimes than we need prisons. I agree SERIOUS reform is needed but straight up abolishing makes no sense to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Embarrassing for the country easily the worst First Lady ever. It’s not even close.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Abuse of power?? The hypocrisy is thick on the right as it usually is. This is why I call people like him even the ones on the left doing this shit traitors. They know exactly what they are doing by saying this shit. I’m more of a Christian than Huckabee is.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FightfulWrestle It’s alittle lackluster in my opinion but I have enjoyed it &amp; if he’s happy fuck it. Miro vs Trent was great &amp; If love to see it again with more time. #AEW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonColeman Let me go print something off my computer just as worthless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching V for Vendetta as we speak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too many and we need to hold them accountable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Veteran4Trump Lmao being a veteran myself I’ll never understand how anyone votes for a draft dodger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present. -Marcus Aurelius-<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well the states 47th in education and top 10 in teen pregnancies so the voting base is well uneducated to put it nicely and deeply religious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump No<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RebyHardy Pumped<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KaylaBraxtonWWE So so good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God damn this Hangman Page &amp; Omega package is fucking incredible lol just killed me with the music. #AEWonTNT #AEW #AEWDynamite<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I said the same thing. I was debating it but that promo sold me big time plus FTR &amp; Bucks as well as Hangman &amp; Omega sold me #AEW #AEWDynamite #AEWFullGear #AEWonTNT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man that PAC video was incredible. #AEW #AEWDynamite #AEWFullGear #AEWonTNT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fucking hell this Kingston promo.... #AEW #AEWDynamite #AEWonTNT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeyHeyItsConrad Bad ass<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Stacy Abrams ran for President she’d get my vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This opening tag match is fantastic #AEW #AEWonTNT  I’m a smidge behind lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True; you should try Ginger Jesus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsbeadux As long as there’s second breakfast.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hereby claim @HBO @hbomax will pay me to write the screenplay for Y The Last Man. Let’s see if this works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ginger Jesus is waiting with open arms for his flock.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow this country has some issues...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@THEonlyMVYoung You give me hope MV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricTrump Lies as usual<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woah he’s serious if that’s the case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Phenomenal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Heatherisme @JakeSomething_ You had the goods kid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Its_JustLovely Exactly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly someone with a fucking platform finally said it. I’m over playing coy with these mother fuckers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Heatherisme I voted No and yeah it makes me mad the system is so corrupt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Worth a watch people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomCottonAR You already betrayed your oath; you have ZERO credibility.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s a cult<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yep<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And a reminder why I don’t fuck with white American women personally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattkoonmusic Yeah have ADHD and was on Ritalin from 2nd grade till 8th. Coming off of that was the worst. I’m trying to make it work for me lol but you can tell on my podcasts when my ADHD kicks in and I go off in left field.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This man is a national treasure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mashaslamovich Well that was a murder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>White people we need to listen better instead of explaining what their problems are. I can see why black people as a whole are fucking exhausted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alex_Flanagan @jemelehill I doubt that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joe_Fann Or stop voting for a racist and people will be nicer about it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MegabyteRonnie Mount up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good fucking question; I’m guessing Jesus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Navy Veteran here and Fuck Trump; he’s a traitor and an embarrassment to the oath we all took. #American #AmericaElection #3Nov #Elections2020 #Vote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I keep telling my liberal friends you want to win over veterans and more conservative people you need to look at this differently. They also need to stop nominating people like Clinton, Biden, Kerry etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeschlossDC Pride because his wife isn’t a traitor who supports a draft dodger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marklevinshow She’s a patriot unlike you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This country racist glad the rest of you are starting to realize this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OpeItsDan Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@queen___pr Ain’t that the truth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>McSally was a shit show; not a single veteran I know in AZ voted for her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously people this needs to be said?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bronsonreedwwe @anniewashereoop I love you for this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MachineGunKA @FiteTV Loved the first one and don’t doubt this. Love everything you guys do and the Podcast.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeAsti11 No<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True you don’t owe us shit Queen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MachineGunKA @FiteTV Done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JESnowden Seriously the company doesn’t get enough credit for how good it’s been the last 2yrs or more but maybe that’s me. Im not knee deep in the business or news like some. Just a mark of epic portions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So are you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No idea why people listen to these polls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep my parents were clear on that and Harris too but that’s their racism talking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwoleWorld I saw Marine transports choppers always forget what they were called. We had them on the BHR when we deployed with the 11th &amp; 13th MEU for both my deployments. It makes me nervous seeing those flying over the city. They can do the training else where to get them qualified<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He’s a shit bag let’s call Jericho what he is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go Fuck Yourself and I’d say it to your face.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Loved that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah making me question if I want to even support it anymore it’s that bad. I just have to be more vigilant about where my money goes &amp; I spend ALOT. #WWE #AEW #MLW #ROH #ImpactWrestling #NWA #NJPW #NXT I appreciate the wrestlers who are VERY open about where they stand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ll be honest I try hard not to judge the religious as I know plenty of good ones. That said nothing drove me to be an Atheist faster than the hypocrisy of the religious right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep and he can fuck off; wish more in his area of influence did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We want this back pretty please<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwoleWorld I can’t stand white people most of the time so yeah this is true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yourqueenhann I’m done with him personally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Accurate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Yeah it’s called counting votes baby Hitler<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep I’ve cut my parents off actions have consequences. I have my military brothers and sisters. The real family I made.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m done with Chris Jericho he can fuck off. #AEW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeanRossSapp Great response loved this and fuck that clown.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Love this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealKevinNash Chris Jericho needs to take a lesson from you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IAmJericho No<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can’t sleep so watching The Devil All The Time and this is a fucked up movie. I’m enjoying it though #Netflix<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCLayfield We are past that point with the cult in both parties<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwoleWorld It is quite nice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smileybabiboo @BLITZENTERPRISE Not me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jemelehill I voted Biden but yeah my folks suck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sendaravenplz They are at the federal level<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArielaNyx The state is 47th in education<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelRapaport @thekjohnston It’s Kentucky it’s 47th in education<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aspynthemermaid Life goals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamilahLindsey @SwoleWorld I’m Ginger Jesus not the real one. Of course he was he was a Jewish &amp; from the Middle East so it’s certain he wasn’t white. Personally I’m an Atheist but don’t have anything against those who believe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamilahLindsey @SwoleWorld Ginger Jesus will provide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany Good thing I’m an Atheist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kanyewest You do know it’s illegal to film or does that only apply to poor people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please Kentucky do the right thing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllEliteTiffany Biden; my country means more to me than my opinion of Biden. Trump is an embarrassment and a traitor. He’s against everything I served for.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>FOLEY IS GOD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maddoxrules Biden; I could never vote for a draft dodger and my country means more to me than my opinions of Biden. BTW thanks for the laughs over the years. I had the red cover but got this after some marine jacked it 😂 Anyways you helped ALOT of active duty &amp; veterans stay sane 🙏  https://t.co/SUaBCGCw9H<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EFFYlives Solid red cock?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Its_JustLovely I’d feel honored lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aspynthemermaid  https://t.co/kk1tc3lCXH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FardaCeebo See that’s this whole dark skin vs light skin debate I can’t comment on because I don’t know. I go off what I’ve seen with the men &amp; women in my own life. I wouldn’t advocate this for any group. All races need to breed together or this division only gets deeper. That’s me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FardaCeebo Fair enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Being the best father I can be raising 2 kids solo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FardaCeebo This also implies if I marry a black woman she isn’t helping her community and that to be is false as well. I understand &amp; agree to parts of this, but I am a white man after all and recognize my position &amp; privilege.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FardaCeebo Ok understand the perspective I do to a point. I’ve also seen plenty of black women treat their black men like dog shit. I was Navy 6yrs &amp; had to help a few friends through their divorce. Both are married to white women &amp; are VERY active in their community.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Huh? You can’t be fucking serious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QuinnMcKay  https://t.co/UzacabeCMa<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HeyHeyItsConrad  https://t.co/EsqVfKk2m6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I gotta admit it surprised me the amount of women in my life asking for this. I’m usually alright your call.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahcpr The Princess Bride<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dylan_Bostic Within a year maybe two; there are out lying factors. Michigan was child’s play; I fully expect a more comprehensive approach for the next one. I may have only been prior Navy but the talk I see even within my own community has me worried.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She’s a god damn veteran who served this fucking country honorable. My blood is fucking boiling for her. I may have been Navy but there is a common theme among us veterans. You don’t fuck with us or you’ll wake the beast.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeytonRoyceWWE Voted for Biden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mothfromdaflats @HeelTurnIreland @WhiplashJ  https://t.co/nl5OCcnG1z<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichHomieJuice Yeah he’s just someone with a big mouth. You should watch H3H3 torch his ass it’s pretty funny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackEvans711 Yep I’m 86 and that’s a Millennial I’m told.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really? Fuck that shit #StillWithHer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously 😒..... I am glad I’m single my ex wife was one of those and it drove me nuts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My first step to being an Atheist was this realization that God didn’t do this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnneRiceAuthor Voted Biden yesterday; I am no fan of his but being a veteran whose deployed I can’t vote for a traitor and a draft dodger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sweet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still so much good stuff and I haven’t even mentioned #MLW yet. If you don’t know Hammerstone &amp; Fatu you need to correct that lol. #WrestlingTwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fans there is SOOOOO much good stuff these days. I’ll be honest #WWE gets the least amount of my attention due to me enjoying things like #ROH more lately. Impact has been fantastic as well. I’m loving AEW personally and NXT is still great but it’s slipped alittle for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahahahahaha fucking love this guy. And yeah please #vote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stellakae Black Box on Amazon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t know who the fuck lil Pump is and I’m glad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I did for Biden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep; what......the.......fuck......was......that. I’m laughing so fucking hard @realDonaldTrump tweeted that and thinks it makes him look cool. Does he not know what the YMCA is in reference to or was I wrong in my interpretation of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JordynneGrace @TheJonGresham Loved watching the match. The whole tournament was phenomenal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AEW Personally this is my wish but I’ll watch wherever she ends up. Fantastic stuff in this fan’s opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So fucking good<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@yourqueenhann Nah just think you’re looking for a recommendation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congratulations I remember my first time right before I swore in to the Navy. #Vote people it’s actually needed to not give Trump any excuse if it’s a blow out. That’s awesome Obama retweeted you. I talk a lot shit to him but I’d take 8 more yrs of him vs 4 more of this mess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @BarackObama I do appreciate you calling out the 2 GOP senators but there was a Democrat care to enlighten the people who that was? I’m in CA so I know EXACTLY who it was &amp; how little ANY Democrat has spoken about it. #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed this is fucking embarrassing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>PLEASE!!! Chris Bey vs Rey Fenix @AEW @IMPACTWRESTLING would be money money money. I also want Omega vs Bey as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep when I was in love for the only time in my life I knew it within 3 months but didn’t say it till probably a year in. She still is the only woman I’ve ever said I love you to. A man KNOWS when that feeling hits; some run from it, others leap into the unknown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshgad Just got done &amp; Fuck Trump; I can’t stand Biden &amp; definitely not a Democrat, but my country means more to me than anything else. I wouldn’t have what I do without it. This is bigger than me at this point &amp; hopefully enough independents or former republicans like me realize this  https://t.co/mhCMAe5Jof<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Absolutely it’s why I am so open as hard and as anxious as it always makes me. It took me YEARS to realize I am not broken, and I am worthy of love. It’s a daily battle especially with the PTSD from the military &amp; childhood. I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for pro wrestling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllEliteTiffany  https://t.co/ilf9kkMm0S<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly; I’ve talked extensively about mental health and my PTSD, but not everyone can. Give her peace and wish her well.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yep<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go fuck yourself @LindseyGrahamSC   As a father of a little girl you can kiss my ass<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I could fap to this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Twitter we may have family members who think and believe differently. They are entitled to those opinions &amp; no one should have to parent family members; however I hold my father &amp; mother accountable for what they say especially in public &amp; around my kids.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cool he’s a bigot what else is new.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You worship your Goddess; people and usually as a man you’ll reap more benefits than you can count. I’ve been in love 1 time &amp; it was overwhelming. On the flip side it changed me fundamentally<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When people talk of u dying love and loyalty this is what pops into my head next to Princess Bride. I’ve been in love one time &amp; fairly recently. It’s a LONG story but love gets thrown around far too much. I’ve told 1 woman my whole life that I loved her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMickFoley I fucking love you Mick for this. Truly Foley is God.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because they’re selfish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erickstevens82 Yep<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Breaking911 @realDonaldTrump Must be nice to be able to prevent others from working or getting to work. I bet you’ve bitched about liberals doing this. How anyone doesn’t see this hypocrisy for what it is; is beyond my level of comprehension<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s been 2 1/2 yrs I’m honestly used to it at this point. Plus raising kids keeps me busy so I barely think about it lately. I think there’s something wrong with me I just realized lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Walking_Weapon So so good though; I also recommend Black Box on Amazon and The Lie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously.... 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go watch this people #NJPW #AEW #WrestlingCommunity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep that’s why I’m so pumped for this. #AEW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DashingChrisBey So wholesome love this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fucking #WWE lol you gotta laugh at them on shit like this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FiteTV @JesusByProxy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Holy shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UTTRob @Hpc2sweet Great balls of Fire and it’s not even close for me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great Balls of Fire it’s not even close #WWE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thejamiesenegal Sending you positive thoughts and I’m so sorry for your loss. I worry about this exact thing as my kids mother is addicted as well. It is a sickness &amp; more attention needs to be brought on this issue. Wishing you the best and hoping you feel better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IM_Teena_Louise @TerraCalaway  https://t.co/fu8Oz3mabZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DashingChrisBey With all do respect your mom is slaying it and a Queen since she raised a pretty incredible person. Love your work and keep killing it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aspynthemermaid Eh on the make up your natural beauty is slaying it though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lmao ok Karen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We as fans need to talk about how bad ass Mike Awesome was more often.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He’s a traitor I’ve been saying it for 4 yrs but I’m just the crazy gunner Jesus looking asshole ranting on twitter to a podcast of like 42 last I checked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They aren’t going to do shit to him. He’s betrayed his country with those emails &amp; trying to get Russian help. His father asked Russia to hack the DNC &amp; nothing. They don’t give a fuck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching Black Box on Amazon Prime. I have high hope for this one as it looks great. #Halloween2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By the way if you haven’t watch #LovecraftCountry and it’s #Halloween2020 #Halloween you need to correct that. It’s the BEST show of 2020 &amp; so deep with layer after layer. It’s honestly brilliant fucking writing. There isn’t anything else to say. #HBOMax<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s a cult like I’ve been saying.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thunderrosa22  https://t.co/bYzJXtn22P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden will get my vote but I don’t expect a fucking thing from him. I mean he was apart of the administration that cut re-enlistment bonuses right before mine. He’s doing fine though while I was fucked outta 15-30k can’t remember it’s been 10yrs. If Biden wins it won’t be by much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boy I love these lectures from rich people about how to best serve the country I actually served. Look I get what he’s saying, but I feel like every celebrity or politician is in the club Carlin mentioned. People making over 200k a year know nothing about my daily life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You don’t have enough money to get my vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#2020Election #VeteransAgainstTrump #Vote #California #ADHD #Halloween #MentalHealth bored and anxious figured I’d BS for a moment.  https://t.co/9Ix5LopTjX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Found this tonight and I’m so happy. I thought it might have been burnt up when my ex wife lit half my collection on fire. (Note to self move your collection; then ask for divorce.)  https://t.co/KyGYZxQJpG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IGN Cool. I think I’ve owned this longer than both my kids have been alive.  https://t.co/g4N3lQ9Npf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I won’t lie being a ref would be bad ass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllEliteFare @Elijahemoore16 @justaguy620 @milbry_reggie @LuFisto @AEW I tweet at Tony about this so hopefully one day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TonyKhan @AEW seriously she’s awesome and would fit perfectly in the division #AEW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/UTSysOjrAt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDannyCage Yep<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MsCharlotteWWE @AndradeCienWWE Well best costume competition is over<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scaramucci And you worked for him so what’s that say about you? Anyone taking you seriously needs a cat scan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NormOrnstein @RexChapman Sometimes if you’re a bitch like he is<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Shazza_McKenzie @NewPhotography This is cause she hasn’t seen Star Wars people not how she looks; she killed it BTW looks incredible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shazza_McKenzie @NewPhotography  https://t.co/r1Lxi6RdXH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexhammerstone This is amazing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actions always have consequences in some form or fashion. I’m not defending him cheating or that threat if he actually made it. Personally there’s a lot of context missing from this and I am not making a judgment on anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One had a daughter; if you’re a father of a little girl you know what I’m taking about. I had to improve myself so she won’t end up with someone like me. The 2nd was falling in love for the 1st time &amp; she cheated on me(I never loved my wife that’s a looooong story).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the world we live in now. There are always 2 sides to a story &amp; though he maybe an asshole none of us know the entire story or their relationship or what lead to this. I owned my cheating &amp; she stayed her call. Eventually yeah I divorced but karma got me good...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a Dad raising both his kids &amp; has had custody for 5yrs come January; this burns my ass, if he really made that threat because she went public with personal business he needs to grow the fuck up and man up own it. I don’t like when personal shit like this is blasted, but...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardGrenell @realDonaldTrump Like his inauguration?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanScavino Nah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump Eh I’ve seen bigger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why the fuck are people taking their kids to a protest? Especially these fucking days. Just the possibility that something could happen like getting pepper sprayed(did OC spray in Navy &amp; did the training for others on the ship. That shit is brutal) I really don’t get people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fayejackson419 Oh sweet baby raptor Jesus  https://t.co/VtjfWQTJ3q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDannyCage He’s a reminder of why I am the Atheist that I am.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaeljknowles Ahahahahahaha &amp; THIS is why I am an Atheist. The hilarity of this is another level. I could go for hours on why you’re a fake Christian if you vote for Trump. Biden is at least a practicing Catholic(not thrilled about that personally) Trump is playing you gullible fools.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So it is a cult got it; also hypocritical as usual.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarbiHayden Texas has issues because if the shoe was on the other foot they’d be losing their shit as would so many others. Hypocrisy at its finest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaynieLuck Yeah it sucks not being able to support Jericho anymore but ZERO chance I spend anymore. I still love him as a wrestler but lost all respect for his critical thinking &amp; reasoning by voting Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/HcMgmiLcCx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aspynthemermaid A Master always needs an apprentice 😉  https://t.co/5ZuqBdfajC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So #California personally looking at a No on #Prop22 The amount of money Uber, Door Dash &amp; Grubhub have pumped into this makes me question who it’s really for. #vote #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sophvas That doesn’t make any sense; she can be a cunt or a bitch but that doesn’t justify cheating or being a cock sucker back. I learned that lesson with my ex wife. My ex wife was bi polar &amp; no meds so fun times. That said still don’t talk down to her especially in front of our kids<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I enjoyed that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sophvas How’d the hell that get out? I mean I’m not condoning it but it’s his business. Now if he’s projecting the reason onto her that’s douche bag material. I was a shit husband while active duty &amp; cheated but never tried to blame my ex wife for why I made the choice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sophvas What did I miss?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LanceStorm @BookerT5x I had such high hopes for that when it was announced. I even liked that red and black WCW logo.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BarackObama @JoeBiden Let’s hope you drink the water this time. I mean talk about a political stunt that makes no sense. If anything being in Flint is a reminder how your administration failed that city as well as local and state leaders.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FiteTV AEW but I’d toss NJPW &amp; MLW into the mix. ROH &amp; IMPACT Wrestling aren’t bad either by any stretch. This is just how this mark sees it. It’s the approach to the product for me personally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AEW Bad ass<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MATTHARDYBRAND @ShaneHelmsCom @sammyguevara I want this so badly lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I live in Santee, Ca and unfortunately yeah I’ve even been guilt tripped about not taking my kids. It didn’t go well for that Karen. Tip #America don’t ever tell a single parent(hell parents in general) what to do with their kids I will fucking destroy you publicly. Tired of this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erickstevens82 Awesome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonFunches Same working on my book of poems; been doing it since I got out of the Navy. Started journals to help with the PTSD &amp; it’s morphed into this. I’ll publish myself if I have to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anniewashereoop @VanessaBorneWWE So bad ass<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VanessaBorneWWE Basically my Dark Lord of the Sith get up #StarWars  https://t.co/dbwcIwXrl2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn that’s a shot across the bow. #WWE love this man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllEliteTiffany You look wonderful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IM_Teena_Louise I live in Santee, Ca and there is a sea of Karen’s here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Startcade and make it geared towards professional wrestling and that aesthetic not sports entertainment type shit. I love both but #WWE leans on the latter too much for my tastes personally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you’re already a God though; what is left to dress up as? 😉  https://t.co/boz6KOioUU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you don’t love this; why the fuck do you watch wrestling?!? lol just being facetious people relax.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I compare the cognitive dissonance on this to that of veteran suicides. It’s  22 a day &amp; people never believe that it is that high. This is even worse because of the negligence by the government &amp; the states &amp; it’s wide spread abilities to affect every American. #vote people<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CatalKasey I won in the end and got both kids so in a way it was worth it. One of the reasons the judge thought she was unstable. She burned a quarter of my comic collection maybe more. I sure can pick em lmao. Dirk is GOD to me was active duty vs Miami &amp; got shit for it. Been a fan forever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarackObama Fuck that &amp; I mean that with every fiber of my being. I’m voting for him because Trump is just that bad. I’m furious he’s the choice this country came up with. It’s why I have ZERO faith in Democrats. Why trust someone who cut re-enlistment bonuses fucking me over when I did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve said I love you to 2 women in my life and only meant it once. Of a woman did this as well run for the hills. HUGE RED FLAG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CatalKasey A finals dirk jersey. I had one and well when I asked my ex wife for a divorce that was one of the things that made it to her bonfire. Mine was white though &amp; seeing this it’s time to replace it lol.  https://t.co/udSC090DAz<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@yourqueenhann My ex wife had like 12 members of her family all right statements to her lawyer that my PTSD was an issue &amp; tried to do something similar.

<|startoftext|>I’m catching up on #AEWDark #AEW because well 2 kids solo takes up mass amounts of my time. I love @SwoleWorld (especially that yellow ranger gear) and @LaFashionista_  was very entertaining wouldn’t mind more of these two.<|endoftext|>

I don’t get how a game can have this bad of a multiplayer. I used to love this game but I’m at the point where I won’t even bother with 2. #Overwatch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It doesn’t get much better than this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Also yes I know Senegal is in Africa; the statement just made me think of my own personal experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haitian women are on another level most American men can’t handle. That’s my own personal experience &amp; those of my marine buddies as well. Honestly Senegal is where I’ll find my next ex wife. Gorgeous women &amp; well educated in my personal experiences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ll be honest I don’t give 2 fucks about the market. Personally burn that bitch to the ground figuratively of course. First 2008 &amp; now the last few bail outs. When will we stop funding the rich? #EatTheRich #Vote #Election2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Born here &amp; two he served this country. He handled that situation far better than I would have. My point it is even though they are entitled to their opinions; it’s reflective of who they are as people &amp; what they value in this life. Most Trump supporters I know personally...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep &amp; personally I’ve been unfollowing the wrestlers who do support Trump or vote for him.

<|startoftext|>This is why I’m an Atheist people like this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheRealSabuECW You must be still high to waste your time at 7am to make a nonsensical response like the previous one.

<|startoftext|>Yes we do as a die hard fan since I was 7. Example;this is me in 2005 in San Diego after I bought tickets off a season ticket holder, that said Jerry Jones won’t he’s the “Im not racist because I have black friends” type.

<|startoftext|>See casually running into your favorite wrestler and asking for a picture is one thing(lucky for the guy; good on him) It’s you fans that stake out the damn airports &amp; hotels that drive me up the wall or that idiot who mails shit to their home addresses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hands down the worst I’ve ever seen. I’ve been a die hard since I was 7(34 now) I think Jerry is tanking at this point wants that Clemson guy. Let’s face it he isn’t paying Dak. #CowboysNation #Cowboys He should but Jerry Jones is a piece of shit person &amp; an even worse GM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Question is this dude fucking blind? Seriously guys how the fuck do you not find this woman attractive and if you don’t well keep it to yourself. As you can tell it takes up ZERO space in her head.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And a few of these guys have SERIOUS issues or did have them. Though I agree to a point about wrestling &amp; social media; I also disagree because I’ve never cared about ratings or star ratings. Instead of selfies it was steroids &amp; drugs so one vice for another is all that changed<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So what’s the point of a beginners playlist @Rainbow6Game if people who’ve clearly played this game can play that list &amp; smoke those who haven’t. 4 matches &amp; it’s very clear this isn’t balanced at all. #Xbox #XboxGamePass #XboxGamePassUltimate #RainbowSix Not liking this so far<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Even though I am voting; I’ve been voting since I was 18 &amp; yet little to nothing has changed in my own life.

<|startoftext|>@AsiaChloeBrown The part that pisses me off as a father is why wasn’t the parent swooping in to move her? No pats her hair and leaves her there. That’s shit parenting<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ahahahaha @dbongino is a fool and is a prime example with the right funding &amp; a whole lotta bullshit anyone can make money in this racket.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go watch #WrestleMania X-8 people. I loved the build and the match was great. It also has Lita in it as well. #WWE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He’d hang up on me lol;Next to Mick Foley I’m certain I’d publicly embarrass myself upon meeting them. Both were and are instrumental in my love of wrestling &amp; getting through deployments. Always watched their matches to ease my mind after  50cal or 25mm watches in the Navy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just like your stupid cunty ass we don’t give a flying fuck who 50 cent is voting for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unfortunately this is where most of my audience is. My Podcasts only pays my electric at this time so I regretfully have to be on here more since I don’t have funds to promote. One day I’ll hire someone to do this bullshit for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shouldn’t she stick to acting? @kirstiealley oh wait that’s only when a liberal is talking you say that bullshit. When it’s a Trump supporter whole different tune. How people don’t see this bullshit for what it is; well that’s beyond me. Whatever she’s a moron.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My parents won’t talk politics with me sometimes; I still bust through that shit like the fucking Kool-Aid man. They have some ignorant and misinformed beliefs being baby boomers. I’ve lost a lot of contact with people I served with because of Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahahahahahahahaha well good thing I’m an Atheist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heel Orton and Face Macho Man would be money. Man that is fun to think about 🤔 #WWE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That would require accountability and well wrestling as a whole isn’t big on that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rossmac212 Bullshit that was all set up Jesus Christ how do people not see this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s shit parenting on the part of the girl who was rude as fuck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As someone who was in the Navy on an Amphib LHD-6 for 5 1/2 yrs; Buck is correct on the taxpayers money. Absolutely a waste; just like all the millions of dollars in fuel we waste just to go do donuts off the coast or do drills that can be done just the same in port.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TherealRVD has been a favorite since #ECW and here’s another example.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Feinstein and Harris are pretty bad. Honestly can’t think of any good ones; I’m of the mind to replace them all by voting them the fuck out.

<|startoftext|>@ChrisFandoms Nope<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BlVCKJAMESDEAN Definitely not what I remember it for; Kofi is the single best highlight of that entire show. The match itself is a phenomenal and the crowd was hot. The main event felt a smidge sloppy in my opinion &amp; personally was let down by it but that’s me. The opening was good but yeah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aspynthemermaid Came across it on my TL and loved it so I searched out more of your work and have been a huge fan since.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Steve Bannon is a moron; I love how he claims Biden stole money from the  Chinese but doesn’t bother mentioning Eric Trump and stealing from cancer kids, but sure Bannon you have the moral high ground. This is another example of why Trump &amp; his supporters are a joke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why I can’t take any Trump supporter seriously. 5 min look at his kids &amp; their money you see a similar pattern. It’s both sides and it’s rich people in general. He doesn’t give a fuck about you, but neither does Biden. Trump to me is significantly worse.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>No won’t ever happen. There are some bridges that can’t be rebuilt. She’s met my kids twice in 14 yrs; hell only seen the woman 3 times I think in 17yrs. I won’t be at her funeral and I expect my siblings to start shit with me over this. Don’t really give a fuck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Fuck @DonaldJTrumpJr and @EricTrump and @IvankaTrump and fuck it add @TiffanyATrump all 4 of these people are terrible. It literally takes ZERO effort to find out why.

<|startoftext|>@White_Mike89 I’m glad to hear that brother; I’ve been single pretty much the entire time so it’s all me. I know that relief and the first night with my kids in home I actually got sleep. Stress drifting away in droves after that. Wishing you the best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I personally won’t do marriage or kids again. I’m good on the two I have got one of each. I definitely agree people be more wise in choosing your partner to have kids with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Often and it drives me insane. My ex even tried using my PTSD from the military as her reasoning &amp; she was using heroin. I couldn’t get CPS to test her but when they finally did after 6 months she popped &amp; she was done even though her moms lawyer kept trying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can relate took me a year battling my ex wife and I got them both. I have had custody 5yrs &amp; yeah she doesn’t pay child support but whatever I got my kids I don’t need her bullshit. Dads need better representation in court. I know there are shit bags but we get generalized too<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It never goes well for that person especially if it’s blatantly done. Maybe this is why the VA thinks Im unemployable lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just hope they do another show on the ship. I enjoyed the last one personally. #AEW #JerichoCruise<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m happy you’re going again that’s awesome as well as to all lucky enough to go. I have my double or nothing tickets saved so I hope next May happens. Being a single Dad I don’t get vacations often. Hell last Double or Nothing was my last one and it was only a day lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One thing I miss more than anything is being on the ocean. There is nothing like it and one day I’ll get on this thing when my Podcast is actually profitable. VA compensation unfortunately doesn’t pay enough to vacation. To get by sure but not much extra room especially w/ 2kids<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@costareports @ErinatThePost At this point I won’t judge someone for not voting for President. I’ve never done that &amp; voted since Bush but I’m over both sides and their bullshit as well as pandering. Trump is worse than Bush but let’s not act like Obama or Clinton didn’t help us get here. Congress too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LanceStorm I keep freaking telling them that but you should know the average American has a rather HUGE sense of entitlement. I also tell them that’s what you do when it gets hard? You run? I served this country &amp; went through 4 deployments so me quitting on this country isn’t happening<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Look at the Republicans Bush Sr. A shit show and then within my lifetime his damn son is president too and no one in this country bats an eye. George Carlin really nailed this on the  head. There’s a big club &amp; is poor folk ain’t in it. #Election2020 #Trump #Biden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Else as I have always done since I was 18(34 now) That said I don’t like Biden or his supporters it shows the disconnect they still have &amp; that led to Trump in the first place. Clinton never should have been nominated her husband sucked why the fuck would we want his wife?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man after finding out my own parents are choosing Trump over Biden. You liberals especially the rich ones have your heads in the sand. Biden may not win &amp; if he does you’ll expect too much of that guy. I’ll be honest I don’t know if I’ll vote for President at all. Sure everything<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Really? Because Obama’s administration I.E. the one you were apart of cut re-enlightenment bonuses fucking me over. I’ll probably vote for you vs that racist dipshit Hitler wannabe, but spare me this bullshit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>lol calm down Jr. Jesus Christ he’s a corporate Democrat not the fucking messiah. I mean I’ll probably cave and vote for him vs Trump(not much of a choice vs a racist, traitor) But I’m in Ca &amp; frankly it’s starting to feel meaningful. I comprised on Clinton &amp; I regret that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously people go watch her #ImpactWrestling stuff and #ALLIN great stuff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well my baby boomer parents don’t see that and are voting Trump. I’m not voting Trump but my Uncle did whose a 20yr Navy vey too. I think this will be close &amp; go to court. Frankly Biden is shit too but the GOP worries me a lot more.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Let’s be honest Harris isn’t much better. It’s why Trump is going to win unfortunately. He has more support than people think &amp; they underestimate how much poor people don’t like Biden.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dylaina_ A lot and why I worry about my daughter. I just hope I show her what a man is supposed to be like and she doesn’t experience this or I’ll have to put someone in the hospital. I’m the last father whose daughter you hurt.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Being it on. Just finished season 2 #TheBoysTV is amazing &amp; has filled that hole #GameOfThrones left<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why it’s always spin from one side or the other. It’s hard to find the hypocrisy especially in this day &amp; age.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Issue with realizing it panders to one religion constantly at the suppression of others or people like me who are Atheists. Churches &amp; the religious get to dictate politics through lobbying but don’t pay taxes. Every religion in this country does this &amp; we do nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She’s absolutely right. It’s why people like @kayleighmcenany &amp; @DanCrenshawTX use political propaganda &amp; the art of spin to make any semblance of a point. They don’t care about “religious liberty” they care about THEIR religious liberty. This country as a whole has a serious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCrenshawTX lol ok man and this ladies and gentlemen is called spin. Danny here is quite good at it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC Hey @SenSasse you really need a civics lesson. This meme applies to this situation as well. Your religious liberty doesn’t dictate my rights or the rights of others.  https://t.co/7khKy29wLw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m honestly debating not voting for either of you. I mean why the fuck should? I can’t think of one reason at this point. Biden is only getting my vote because Trump is that insane. Biden is a shit show &amp; his administration will be as well just a different flavor &amp; less racist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t expect either of these assholes do actually do something that will help people like me. I am not against conservatives but cult like devotion to Trump loses my vote. Pandering to idiots like Haskins &amp; supporting #AmyComeyBarrett confirmation might lose you my vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m over Democrats like this guy and lunatic trump supporters. I was a conservative &amp; both parties are a joke at this point. How’s its even legal @DarrellIssa is running is horse shit. Lived in East County 17yrs; stayed here after the Navy. The cost of living is outrageous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ACampaNajjar yeah be thankful Issa is worse or you’d have lost my vote. I’ve felt with that Haskins guy &amp; he’s a douchebag who made racist statements in that group of his. I was literally kicked out of that group for speaking out against some of the racism in that group.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IM_Teena_Louise Well you’re too nice but I won’t be. I just lose faith more in people over shit like this.

<|startoftext|>I wouldn’t mind the emails too to be honest. Granted it’s just another instance in a long list of political issues from either party. Scooter Libby was a thing after all.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IM_Teena_Louise @EFFYlives The outfit is legendary and love the shirt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Personally want her in AEW for the match ups &amp; maybe a title run worthy of her legendary career. WWE for me personally has dropped the ball hard since she’s come back. If she’s happy then good for her seriously; just a marks perspective. #WWE #AEW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The bigger question I have is why the fuck the US media feels the need to tell me the Taliban wants this? It’s a waste of fucking time especially when he’s doing things that actually require focus. I have no respect for our media because of time wasting shit like this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahahahahahahahahahahaha this clown is a fucking moron. I have friends stationed in DC &amp; trust me the thing was a joke. Candace Owens paying mother fuckers to show up. Plus at best maybe 4K there and that’s nothing to me personally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great show<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thousands? Lady maybe at best 4K and that’s being generous. How anyone buys the bullshit this woman sells is beyond my level of comprehension. The left has their people but Candace is particularly obvious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealCandaceO @BLEXIT man this is sad; the cult like devotion to a party that doesn’t give 2 shits about you. The Democrats are bad lots to complain about, but to act like the republicans are better is humorous &amp; anyone with half a brain sees what you’re doing. Again the left has its people too.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LaurenWitzkeDE Wow you’re special and racist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So she’s a racist and an idiot. Man this is embarrassing and if I was from Delaware or in her family there would be an intervention. I can’t count how many people I’ve served with Lady that fall under your bullshit. ALL of them are Americans &amp; all contribute far more than you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow talk about racist. She’s also not very bright. This is embarrassing that someone like this is even allowed to run for office. Maybe my Atheist ass needs to run for office. Oh wait this country would never elect me. Lady shut the fuck conservatives are just as bad.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HKrassenstein Who cares about the F word; you do realize you’re feeding the conservative media by doing this? Whatever I’ve given up trying to get through to the left. It’s as bad as the right at times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DineshDSouza lol if you say cock boy; you’re a felon and the fact anyone listens to you says so much about the state of this country. You can spin your narrative as much as you like; history isn’t going to remember you. You are an afterthought just like me. Except I’m not a traitor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No I don’t give 2 shits what Bob Dole thinks. Also it’s hilarious reading this Robby Starbuck clown &amp; his wife suckling at Trump’s tit. The music video on her page is worth a watch. It’s peak hypocrisy &amp; cringe; considering Trump’s ties to Epstein<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kelthecelt This makes me livid; professional wrestling isn’t just a man’s space. Video gamers seem to struggle with this as well. I’m so mad for the person(wonderful soul) I just hope I am not supporting the person or persons in any manner.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This woman is a moron; I could go for hours about Trump &amp; this very topic. The hypocrisy is hilarious I must admit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurenWitzkeDE but Trump is so much better lmao you do know he paid a pornstar right and had an affair while his wife was pregnant but sure you get ruffled about this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WrestlingCommunity #WrestlingTwitter this is your reminder to watch #LuchaUnderground so many good matches &amp; the story world they built was incredible.

<|startoftext|>@PhoenixAEW This is just fucking embarrassing and pathetic. As a veteran I don’t get his support in my community. He’s a draft dodger he’d never get my vote just off of that alone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Follow me on #Twitch @Twitch darthmavious as I’ll be listening to music while I write my outline for the Podcast. Might do some commentary on the Bible &amp; Bhagavad-Gita. We will see where it goes today. #SprinkleOfGinger<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Oh I’m going all in  https://t.co/9B3TSOWd1y<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a Dad raising 2 kids it’s what made me become an even bigger fan. It’s the same with KO. I was always a fan of both but seeing how amazing of fathers they both are &amp; being one myself it made me respect them on a level outside wrestling; which in turn increases my support in it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMattCouch Ahahahaha the irony of this tweet is thick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chuckwoolery Or you but here we are Chuckie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kenbone18 You just threw away a vote so cool thanks for nothing. I HATE Biden he’s everything wrong with the Democrats as is Clinton(though you voted for her makes no sense with your reasoning here.) why the media cares about this so much worries me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why I call it a cult; I fucking hate this ideal worship. If you’re going to worship somebody; worship Ginger Jesus; his blessings are many, and your bounty will be plentiful with his teachings. All Ye @kanyewest righteousness be in the light of Ginger Jesus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a life long #NFL fan I’ve even noticed this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Jesus Christ we all make mistakes on here with grammar but you’re on another level constantly. This is embarrassing the President talking like this. I was a Republican &amp; voted for Bush &amp; Arnold in CA. ZERO chance I vote for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlxThomp I don’t give a shit. This isn’t fucking news Jesus Christ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why the fuck do any of you or the god damn media give two shits what Ken Bone is fucking doing? One he’s a moron just by reading his reasoning for his stance. A 3rd party vote at this point is useless. We do need more parties but that’s a bridge we cross after Nov. 3rd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the fuck is wrong with so many of you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@halalhorchata That’s what I was listening too it keeps sharing the whole album.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You vote for Trump; you’re advocating for these types. This is embarrassing to hear Americans so willing to go to War with their own countrymen. This guy clearly has never served; this is a disgrace.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#NewProfilePic  https://t.co/EHGxvmaxoM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BCis4Life Such Great Heights is actually on now I did a shuffle cause the whole album is honestly great. I went through a huge Death Can phase too. Still listen to them off and on especially as I’ve gotten older &amp; I relate to them more and more. I will follow you into the dark is my fav.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also burn the flag lady it isn’t supposed to touch the fucking ground.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same I was like damn it’s been that long? Sleeping In and Nothing Better are my personal favorites.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let’s add this to the list of why I am an Atheist.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A gay man saved my life. He’s my brother &amp; he knows I’d take a bullet for him. Hell half the men I served with were gay or bi it’s the fucking Navy; anyways you’re religious beliefs don’t dictate law in this country. They should have the same rights as straight people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wrestlingleva @UmbrellaAcad Locke and Key it’s great or Raised By Wolves, as well as Lovecraft Country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love this band; the one album has been played to death. It’s been awhile though been on a Death Cab binge lately<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I LOVE Yokozuna; as a kid he was bigger than life &amp; he cheated my hero Bret Hart. I respected him in a way; I was a weird kid ok. Anyways this episode is fantastic and as always thanks ⁦@JRsBBQ⁩ you are the GOAT for this fan. Plus Yoko &amp; Owen loved   https://t.co/Q6vFLo9G6w<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dhancock110 Dude I have a 14yr old boy and 10yr old girl so I feel ya. We were late everyday last week at least 10 mins. It just was a cluster fuck all round and I’m solo. I hate dealing with school stuff; one thing I miss about marriage lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jewlstheoutcast  https://t.co/4yl45hwHwQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hunterbrook20 I don’t think anyone wants that from me ;) lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Totally underrated @LeoDiCaprio movie. I remember seeing it in theater.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EddyOnly8 @TonyKhan pretty please<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why isn’t this man on my TV #AEWDark  ???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone can handle this how they see fit but I see some of you coming for Joey Ryan but you’re giving Marty a pass. It makes ZERO sense. #WrestlingCommunity #WrestlingTwitter #Wrestlers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you’re a parent you can’t support this guy it sucks I know. I’ve spent ALOT of money on his merch &amp; it now resides in a box in my garage. I’ll eventually throw it out it’s part of the process because I was such an AVID fan. It makes me question if I should still support.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can I ask why so many are STILL following @MartyScurll ? As a father of a girl; I don’t care where you are or who you are. You touch my kid it won’t end well. This response sickens me especially as someone whose been through abuse &amp; knows these types well. My own family so please<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaxBoot It’s a cult<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unfortunately Biden; it’s country over this racist traitor. Draft dodging Putin ass kissing orange clown would never get my vote.#ImVotingFor Oh I was a Republican for 7yrs &amp; voted for Bush &amp; Arnold. The choices then sucked but vs what the Democrats offered no thanks. Both suck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most I’ve ever made is close to 60-65k maybe when I was married &amp; active duty. Now maybe 45 roughly &amp; if I wasn’t in CA I’d probably be doing better but it’s impossible to move too much money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m a veteran receiving 100% compensation &amp; unemployable I don’t even make 63k a year about 18 less roughly. I am VERY grateful for what the VA has done for me but it definitely can do more &amp; with a purpose. My rent eats up over half my compensation each month.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Infinite Jest is a good book; a great book? No not to me, but one worth reading of for no other reason then to form your own opinions of it vs having them fed to you. I can tell a few of you never read the book;You used spark notes or had someone else tell you how they feel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iammix24 @realDonaldTrump ZERO chance I vote for him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenThomTillis @realDonaldTrump You need to be voted out this is pathetic and you know what you’re doing that’s the sad part<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods Lol so you’re racist too shocker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyNemmity Same<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same I hope my daughter is nothing like her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyannePolls Sure you did<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tomi Lahren if that’s how you spell it is a fucking idiot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomiLahren Boy you’re a sad little woman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@memegenerator99 @JoeBiden So does Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HalalHorchata Same<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maskedbabyface Yes ALOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish this kinda thing worked; it’s been 3yrs we know what Trump is and who he is. When someone shows you who they are believe them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRickWilson I’ll believe that when I fucking see it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow this makes everything he did that much more impressive. I mean that HIAC with HHH is one of my favorite matches period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FiteTV  https://t.co/qgPKjQGlp4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeyHeyItsConrad Trevor Murdoch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Insomnia it’s a bitch. One of the many reasons I assume the VA has me unemployable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benshapiro This is easily the dumbest thing you’ve said to date.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyannePolls I’d say you are for willfully putting your child in danger. So who really is the bad guy here? As a father of a girl;she’s going to remember everything you’ve said &amp; done during this time you betrayed your country. That shame will be carried with you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My dumb ass forgetting it’s 2:45am when messaging people or responding lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shazza_McKenzie I’d kill to be able to purchase any of the @WSWWrestlingAUS DVDs. You vs. Indi Hartwell vs. Deonna Purrazzo is one of my favs I’ve seen &amp; ots my first introduction to you &amp; Ms. Hartwell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So this is why I’ve never been loved lol. I was in love once didn’t eat her ass though. She got 30-45 mins sometimes longer depended on my jaw.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FiteTV Talented<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KristinaSnowden My thought process as well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man we need that match anywhere. I just need it myself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IM_Teena_Louise The glasses are great and love the shirt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JPWARHORSE Your sheer presence would obliterate his sagging husk filled with cheeto dust and McDonald’s.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Current: Kenny Omega, Cody Rhodes, Thunder Rosa, Shida, as well as Zicky Dice; Nick Aldis too.   Past: Bret Hart, Owen Hart, Chris Jericho(I know he’s technically current but he’s old lol), Chris Benoit(not the man his wrestling abilities), Ric Flair(of course) &amp; Kurt Angle #WWE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ll go over the whole story as it could be Therapeutic for me who knows. I’ve only been open recently about it. #Mentalhealth #DepressionIsReal #depressed #THeMighty #USNavy #ReachOut #sucide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve said this before &amp; I’ll say it again. Especially considering the situation with Rona &amp; hopefully this helps someone reach out. I wanted to blow my brains out in 2010 &amp; even had the gun in my mouth. 2 more seconds I wouldn’t be here. My deployments had worn me thin...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I also can’t thank @kelthecelt @IM_Teena_Louise @PhoenixAEW &amp; @AndyNemmity @KristinaSnowden and last but not least Mr. Snowden as well. He hasn’t accepted my request so couldn’t tag him. I want to thank k @CodyRhodes @youngbucks &amp; @KennyOmegamanX for keeping me alive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a VERY hard topic for me; I was sexually abused as a child; 7 to roughly 11 maybe 12. It happened again while passed out drunk in my rack on deployment in the Middle East. It’s taken a few yrs of therapy &amp; my brothers &amp; sisters I served with to help me get where I am.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This shit makes me embarrassed as a wrestling fan &amp; why it’s so hard to financially support #WWE #RAW #SmackDown from the McMahons entire family supporting Trump to this #Twitch Situation to hell people giving Vince a pass for so many things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same this next promo of his is critical<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IM_Teena_Louise Well you are and technically a MILF if that’s not over stepping boundaries. If it is I apologize.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NickJFuentes Well it’s a pretty Ignorant thing to say just to troll the liberals. They do that themselves so it makes you like like a moron. A very uneducated moron.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>agreed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abadon_AEW Event Horizon; just watched The House That Jack Built on Hulu recommend it for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KLoeffler @realDonaldTrump This is embarrassing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the fuck is this bullshit? How anyone doesn’t see this as anything more than propaganda is beyond me.  Fuck this is embarrassing &amp; I hate that I have to vote Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was wondering the same thing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Personally been a fan since the CWC and looking her up after that. There’s so many matches I’d love to see across a few companies. Priscilla vs Moth, vs Heather Monroe, vs Thunder Rosa(was amazing recently want again), vs Taco Michinoku, I could on &amp; on. Oh vs Marti Bell too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/Q3bwL0fO8m<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bullshit. #Netflix<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It’s this kinda shit that’s making me vote Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thunderrosa22 Abadon for sure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMattGaetz How’s his butthole taste?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Charlie Kirk is a fucking idiot. That’s all I have to say. His crap isn’t worth retweeting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love this feud and the Rock selling stunners. I think wrestling can be this popular again. Some could argue with all the platforms &amp; companies it is. I’m not that guy but there definitely feels like a shift is happening. That’s me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FiteTV No<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Another lie my parents taxes went up under yours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Another lie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump This means nothing to someone like me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What about Atheists? I’d say we are alittle but more oppressed vs Christians especially in this country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump That’s a lie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The VA tries ways to NOT get you the help you need. I’ve been waiting on an MRI &amp; to find out what to do next with my rotator cuff for weeks. The pain I am in makes even typing this hurt. Do you give a shit? Probably not &amp; it’s expected at this point. It’s always lip service.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a lie &amp; a HUGE one. I’m a veteran whose at 100% unemployable by the VA. This isn’t even close to true. He only gave a 3.1% increase which was more in line with Bush vs Obama but it still is shit when my rent is $2070. This has been the worst the VA has been in years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am voting against you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Wow unbelievable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Such a phenomenal match #NXT #NXTTakeOver31<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I really wish the VA cared enough about the pain I keep telling them is in my shoulder. It’s been months now and PT isn’t cutting it. I need the damn MRI and soon. Have to call my primary to get it set up; frustrating how long things can take sometimes.  it’s my rotator cuff.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Get some kind of a job that provides enough so my father who is a boomer will get the fuck off his high horse about wrestling &amp; my want to make money in the business. I don’t care if it’s podcasts, announcer, productions, writing(prefer), booking, manager etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boy I learned the hard way at 25(34 now)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Obviously a lot has changed since I graduated in 2005. Girls more often play. The last 2 women I dated HATED video games so fellas calm the fuck down &amp; don’t act like an incel it’s embarrassing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ll never understand how men get upset at women in the gaming space. I would have killed in high school to be able to even mention my love of video games let alone a girl want to play them.

Those last 2 were awful and if #HBOMax  hadn’t announced the prequel I’d probably still be pissed about it. The show needed 2 more seasons easy to flesh out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Clone Wars and I’’ struggling to think of another;(here’s my all time favorites with shit endings or last season) Dexter(last two here), Lost, Game of Thrones(the worst offender), How I met your mother, Shameless, but the shows as a whole were incredible.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey @starwars can we get on making Exar Kun &amp; Ulic Qel-Droma Cannon please. #StarWars #Disney<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I always loved her; she was always entertaining and a great wrestler. There’s a few matches I’d love to see in #AEW but that’s me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erik_WWE They’ve never had deer jerky; that shit is amazing. Also people get a fucking life if you’re coming on twitter to bitch about hunting fucking deer Jesus Christ.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The 3. Sure the casino scene was useless &amp; took up what 25 mins? The plot literally barely moves it’s the biggest black spot for me in the movie. Some people got way too worked up over the Leia stuff. The scene just needed to have her die &amp; I stand by that. #StarWars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>KOTR series and still think that need a series vs movies too much to fill in that needs to be there. I’m trying to give Disney a chance even with the mess that was the sequel trilogy. I still LOVED Last Jedi. I plan to make a video on my YouTube explaining why it’s the best of...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@disneyplus you should hire me to do your Sith lore. If not me someone else as obsessed with it prior to you wiping it away.

<|startoftext|>Twice to the Middle East &amp; 2 rim pacs. One of those a month after an 8 month deployment where we did 127 days straight with the 11th MEU on board. I also get it for PTSD &amp; again I don’t have to explain that to anyone unless I choose too. It’s not luck people I sacrificed ALOT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That drives me up the wall. I get that when people find out about my compensation from the Navy. No I am not lucky mother fucker. I’ve had a knee surgery, needles shoved in my back due to pain issues, oh &amp; my rotator cuff is apparently next. I EARNED that compensation; deployed..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWrestlingGirls She’s fantastic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate the mother fucker and think he’s a traitor. That said he is the President &amp; the instability that would cause I am not ok with. Also we’d be stuck with Mike Pence who is a religious nutjob. We definitely don’t want that. Also he’d be a martyr to people fuck that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ImChelseaGreen @Hooters You may break twitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want a Darth Vader movie set between Episode III and IV. I wouldn’t object to maybe including some time after IV before V even. #DisneyPlus #Disney #StarWars<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pufisgod Just when I thought Puf couldn’t be any cooler.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrestleJoy @AEWonTNT Cody’s moonsault off the cage; pure insanity even my son who NEVER watches wrestling with me sat and watched that. Makes me super stoked thinking about it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I could but the country needs to know these types are real. It’s her family’s fault for not saying hey you’re insane and you’re embarrassing everyone.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thewrestlebrook Yeah no she’s getting swatted off me as gently as I can. I don’t care how attractive you maybe; I’ve had knee issues &amp; lower back so jumping on me like that when I am not expecting it would hurt or jar me in a manner that’s uncomfortable on top of the situation being that<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gailkimITSME I’d vote for a woman; never has been an issue for me personally. My issues with Clinton were never that. She’s just a corporate democrat &amp; I didn’t like her husband so why would I support her? Practically same policy. Still voted for her vs Trump; duty to my country over party<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So he really did this? Jesus Christ these jokes write themselves. Nothing says I owned the libs like dildo blasting your own ass. Good God of this clown can make money in politics I’ll be rich eventually.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Judge him for being a racist shit head fine, running around naked? Ok but why the fustian for Coke? Even Eric Clapton wrote song about it. Also fuck the Proud Boys. Fucking losers playing wannabe soldiers.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@meenaharris @cmclymer @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris He’s getting my vote but other than that No. I’ll deal with my Biden issues after Trump is gone. Him not condemning White Supremacy left me with no choice. I wasn’t going to vote for President &amp; I still debate it being in CA. Biden has to defeat him soundly so here we are<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well @MSNBC @maddow prime example of why I don’t bother with their network either. The pundits they have on are pathetic &amp; it’s all a corporate media driven sham. They are the Liberal Fox News.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouDobbs By not condemning White Supremacy and propping up the proud boys? Man your standards are beyond low.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s my list. I’d add Mitch Hedberg as an honorary mention. Guy was so good but sadly died too young.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LanceStorm @JoylynnJohnson I’ve contemplated moving to Canada but the assault weapon ban erks me(minor thing really) I just can’t leave my country I served just yet. She’s on life support but she’s not dead yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThisIsJAIDEN Well I am against it especially being a veteran who has brothers &amp; sisters who I’d take a bullet for. They are my family &amp; we deployed together. So yes I will fire off as many of those tweets as I think are needed. It’s not black peoples job to do this it’s ours. That’s me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IngrahamAngle If only you cared to denounce the Proud Boys too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dnellicious Been battling them too. I got brothers and sisters I served with who I would take a bullet for. You bet your ass I am all the way down those mother fuckers throats on my own family. Some have stopped talking to me &amp; good riddance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never played it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast I can’t afford to go on those anyways<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyCage55 @RealMikeBennett I watched it there is no way to spin this as you’re trying to do. Shocker another White guy argues this point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SaraCarterDC @Comey @DickDurbin @realDonaldTrump @JohnBrennan I read the Mueller report lady and I can see with my own eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dbongino So are you though that’s the pot calling the kettle black<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanAFournier Just like Trump does all the time; so you’re used to it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan We are expected to believe you didn’t know those kids were getting molested? Give me a break; you shouldn’t even be employed by the government if they did a proper back check on you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanmdav Wow I read the Mueller Report did you? Sure doesn’t seem like it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity And Trump on America; I mean he loves Putin and that’s not an issue for you? Boy you Reagan people sure changed your tone rather quickly on Russians.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayfeely Wow you’re a fool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People like Megyn(seriously who are your parents slap them) don’t help the national discourse at all. She’s there to keep the liberals &amp; Conservatives in a pissing contest. She rarely spouts facts &amp; when she does it’s spin most of the time or half truths. Waste of time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s @megynkelly people why do we care what she says? She has ZERO credibility &amp; is all opinion &amp; spin. This is why Trump has become normalized because the media gives this woman more attention then it should. I am a nobody with 25 podcast listeners; she has a platform.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@megynkelly lol ok Karen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right? lol I do it everyday but I only average 12-23 just depends on the week it seems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This isn’t a good thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very cowardly @SenatorTimScott<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What she said<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RossBarkan No they don’t I’ve been poor my whole life and served in the Navy; even deployed a few times. Nothing about him appeals to the lower class unless uneducated. I know plenty of his base where I live that lacks even a HS diploma let alone college.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomCottonAR Boy you’re special<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProjectLincoln @SenateGOP They have none stop expecting it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikkiHaley @standamericanow You do know the VA is run by the government right and provides healthcare to veterans. I would know I am 100% unemployable by them. Please stop this bullshit; I was a Republican for 7yrs &amp; it’s become a cult like the Democrats. Party politics over actually doing something<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikkiHaley Nothing of mine went what what are you talking about? My parents paid more in taxes thanks to Trump’s bill. Just more BS spin from you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikkiHaley Healthcare isn’t a fucking competition that’s what you people don’t get. As a veteran whose 100% from the VA we can do it. The VA has its issues(No Trump hasn’t done a damn thing to help us) but it works &amp; I get more quality care vs not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikkiHaley You’re supporting a white supremacist how is that case closed? This is sad even for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Media gets serious about calling him out on it. I don’t trust a single rich person in this country they’ve given me ZERO reason to. If you listened to my podcast you’d understand more on why I am where I am on both these guys #Debates2020 #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In fact when he was VP Obama’s administration cut re-enlistment bonuses which fucked me. You guys would get more support if you stopped putting these Democrats up on pedestals. I’ve been bitching about Trump &amp; who he is for 3 yrs now, but after he does that on TV is when the...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am not asking anyone to agree with me or understand my choices; none of you really know me or what I’ve been through so assume away. I won’t vote Trump because he’s a racist &amp; a traitor. I don’t want to vote for Biden; he shouldn’t be there &amp; he’s done nothing as well for vets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m sorry I don’t like Biden &amp; think he did horribly. That said Trump was worse &amp; couldn’t condemn white supremacy. There will be spin but he didn’t condemn it &amp; his words toward the wannabe soldier boys that are the Proud Boys was definitely worse. I’m in CA it will go Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenKing Biden isn’t a decent guy that’s debatable, but Trump is worse by a mile. Especially when you can’t condemn white supremacy. I’m in CA so my Presidential vote is meaningless other then to pad Biden vs Trump. I comprised last time for Clinton against my morals &amp; convictions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CandidlyCandy_ I wish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dylan_Bostic Car and house on acres away from everyone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey #California @GOPLeader needs to go. I’ve seen spin before but that was pathetic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TorreySmithWR In fact they are arguing against it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SattaLaFleur Don’t lump me in with those mother fuckers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LanceStorm That I would get. I mean to get a Cameo of you saying “If I could be serious for a minute” would rule all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theREALgigante_ @AndyNemmity It would be the US Marshals that remove him if he refuses to go. That said we’ve never had someone like Trump it’s hard to pin point how much the bureaucracy will stop him before we cross that threshold<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theREALgigante_ @AndyNemmity Well if Proud Boys show up or some left wing lunatics create a situation kinda thing. I honestly can’t imagine how that would go about but I can see that before anything else that I’ve  seen people mention. It’s extremely doubtful &amp; there is definitely a question of legality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SmashingCrumpet @AndyNemmity As someone whose served yes there is a portion that will support him. The larger force no but at this point he’s divided us so well especially in my own community it’s scary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWEArmstrong @RealKArmstrong That’s quality Grandpa time right there lol. My Dad still does this with my 10yr old girl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KekePalmer Gotta love this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ejeancarroll @realDonaldTrump @MaryLTrump @kaplanrobbie @KaplanHecker @JoshuaMatz8 I hope you do but I don’t trust our justice system<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very cool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear God.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnthonyBLSmith I live in Santee,Ca tell me about it. Those idiots are in abundance here and if not it’s still Trumpville overall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My father was the same when I got clean. It’s what a real father would say. Not someone whose a stand in like Trump; man has never been a REAL father to any of his kids. #Debates2020 #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyNemmity They won’t stop him; that’s not our job. Well the Army’s or Marine Corps. The US Marshals or the Guard if it got that far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boy Parler is a shit show; I just had to see and the setup alone sucks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@philipttirino @realDonaldTrump They didn’t elect him he lost the popular vote by a lot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mercedesschlapp @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden Just like Trump and the white supremacy question right? The man couldn’t even answer it. The biggest fucking softball I’ve ever seen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrumpWarRoom No he hasn’t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>James Woods is a fucking joke. Seriously why does anyone in this guys life deal with him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MadKing1981 Zicky Dice?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@THEvacationJJ @CMochaPrincess That’s sad after that shit show<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bad ass photo love it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump you’re an embarrassment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shazza_McKenzie I miss Perth; I want to go back fuck this shit show. My country just won’t listen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I could definitely use it. Don’t get child support at all for 2 kids and raise them on VA compensation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteButtigieg We know he did we need to stop with the coy bullshit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyNemmity I agree trust me. Trump can fuck right off. That veteran shit set me off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/DrxImSdqMd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DashingChrisBey That makes me sad but I understand honestly. I have brothers I served with who feel the same way and it makes me angry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MariaLKanellis And I couldn’t be prouder as a fan of you and your husband. Wish you both much success in what’s next<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fayejackson419 Too many I served with won’t just sit by and let that happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>White supremacy? The Stand by and stand back line really upset me as well. I am no expert on The Proud Boys but that’s definitely not what needed to be said. #Debates2020 #Debatenight #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Living in CA you haven’t done a god damn thing for me. Now Biden can kiss my ass too they both looked good awful. Then he just couldn’t even condemn white supremacists. What the fuck is going on that these are the 2 we get to choose from? Jesus Christ how hard is it to condemn..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump as a veteran whose raising 2 kids solo with no child support. My shoulder needs an MRI. My back isn’t in great shape(basically 14 needles in the back fun shit) and don’t forget my knee surgery I’ve had on my right. Hip issues incoming. 100% unemployable by VA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fayejackson419 Nasty stank under way booty. Im talking engineers working in the pits stank fucking booty. Middle East deployed; 120 heat high humidity and flight deck rover watch nasty sweat booty. Fuck I need a bowl.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gailkimITSME  https://t.co/0cGnw0jtW5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robreiner You thought that in 16. I hope you’re right I do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m done he couldn’t even condemn white suprematist. #Debates2020 #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You lying sack of shit you haven’t done shit for veterans Id know. I’m at 100% and I could go for hours and how both these assholes have to@be fair. #Debates2020 #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KristinaSnowden This is brutal Im about done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pattonoswalt I’m poor sorry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck you Trump; you haven’t taken care of shit. I’m still waiting for a fucking MRI &amp; I’m at a good VA in La Jolla. The cost of living goes way up but 3.1% is something to brat about? Fuck that. #debates #Debate2020 #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArielaNyx It’s a fucking shit show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump brought back football that’s fucking great. This is a joke a fucking joke. Biden isn’t making me feel any better. #debates #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Both of them do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Definitely been to a few. #PresidentialDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what we have to choose from? This fucking shit show #Debate2020 #Election2020  how both these guys got here is a testament to the failures of our current system. I don’t want to vote for either of these clowns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tax the Churches please<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeyRyanOnline go ahead and block me fuck head.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SueZieCue @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Like I said keep it out of Government and schools unless you’re teaching all religions in a historical capacity. Otherwise I keep my views to myself for the most part.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fluffygbm @Jazz_Fan_76 That could literally mean anything I want it too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fluffygbm @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Very vague of you; also you died how do you know? The Bible or your pastor isn’t an acceptable answer for this question. If I am wrong your God at least according to his book will judge me based on my works &amp; they are plenty. I’d argue I’m more Christ like then some folk here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScruggsAusten @fluffygbm @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump I’ve pointed that out to a lot of people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You’d have to fly me out there but sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KayfabeKilling @TheClosedFist Hell yeah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arielhelwani What a clown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenWolf309 @JoeyRyanOnline Nope I have quite a few friends who believe in God whatever works for them. I hate when people use it to justify their actions. As long as it’s out of my government &amp; schools; you won’t hear much from me. I spent years trying but I won’t be a fake Christian that just feels wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC7 My ass won’t be going fuck that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Class fucking Act people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeanRiddler91 @WWE_MandyRose That is awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Divas era vs knockouts era(still on going) Austin’s heel run pre HHH injury. Nikki Bella to me wasn’t that entertaining; I don’t judge or have an opinion on those who do but man do I get Heat for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BRWrestling The Divas era vs knockouts era(still on going) Austin’s heel run pre HHH injury. Nikki Bella to me wasn’t that entertaining; I don’t judge or have an opinion on those who do but man do I get Heat for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahTheRebel It’s the sad fucks who bitched about Capt. Marvel being a woman now. Personally I’m stoked it helped get my daughter into Marvel. Sometimes people just need a life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Parrow_ 2 mins<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Both<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AVindman He is going to contest either way so I worry what some far left or right idiot may do. His words carry weight people don’t recognize that enough &amp; it’s going to be a issue if he loses. Zero chance I vote for Trump; I am in CA so Biden will win with or without me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EFFYlives @Parrow_ @FiteTV @GCWrestling_ @collective2020 @wrtv @Pacers @Colts Parrow is awesome; his Twitter is definitely underrated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel like I learned something today. I had ZERO idea what a twink is. Google had since corrected that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Damnoldguy @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump And you came to this conclusion how exactly? I’ve probably been to more countries then you &amp; states for that matter. Clearly I can articulate myself just fine. I was also a Republican &amp; now Independent so keep assuming you’re doing a bang up job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lance Storm is my God Damn hero and If I could be serious for a Minute.....(seriously though he’s not wrong)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jessithebuckeye Agreed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m really disappointed to see some people I admire on here STILL following Joey Ryan. #WrestlingCommunity #WrestlingTwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dee15gon4 @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump You are right but so many trump supporters who claim to be Christian are saying otherwise. Jesus Christ was crucified by the Romans. Even I believe he was a real person; just not Devine. People are entitled to believe that he was. That is never my issue despite my opinions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is fantastic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HotYoungBriley You’re my hero for how much you’ve dump trucked him. He really should just crawl in a hole.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScruggsAusten @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump If it works for you then go for it; me personally I see it this way. I believe Trump does too; it’s a tool usually used to abuse power. Rarely is it used to advance out species in any meaningful way. That’s me though; I just don’t want the two mixed. Church &amp; state that is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“Properly read, the Bible is the most potent force for atheism ever conceived.” -Isaac Asimov-<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KaylaLezjuande @Jazz_Fan_76 The kingdom of God is within you’ (Luke 17:21)  I know I own a Bible and do read it. I agree with you; Jesus spoke out very clearly about greed &amp; those who wield the Lords name for profit. I just can’t believe in something I don’t feel is real for me it’s that simple<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HalalHorchata If that’s you yeah. Gorgeous  https://t.co/WbYg9t8QeD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anasha47662718 @Jazz_Fan_76 That doesn’t change the fact God let’s one creation use another to try and prove some point. God shouldn’t have to prove anything to a lesser creation one would think. You can justify his actions all you want<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HalalHorchata I get told I look like a Ginger Jesus especially in my robes lol. I figured eh I’ll lean into it.  https://t.co/DXRcvOQLNn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@youngbiafran93 @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Bye Christian lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Damnoldguy @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Im a bot? Well shit that’s news to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tplori1 @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Very Christ like of you. The Pope said it’s better to be an Atheist than a fake Christian so be you I’ll be fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jay00253352 @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Lmao 😂 this was great thank you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Goody032 @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump No being an Atheist is literally the absence of faith. I don’t believe in your God or any Gods. Jesus Christ how many times do I need to explain this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WWEonFOX HBK vs Taker. I love Mankind/Taker but it’s just brutality and a testament to Mick Foley having the biggest balls in the wrestling world. I like HBK/Taker more because we’ll just watch the damn thing it’s amazing &amp; has a perfect debut to boot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeyRyanOnline can go fuck himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sabrinaparicee I was commenting on why I personally lob those 2 together. Your comment came across my feed and I responded because I had been asked before why I lobbed them together<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealCandaceO @JoeBiden I am impressed at the bullshit you peddle lady and the people you actually get to believe you. This is just sad on so many levels. I would have chastised a Democrat too for this BS. The fact you don’t see both parties as the problem tells me it’s about money for you nothing else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great story and I could only imagine how mad she was lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Eh it’s easier to lob it all together frankly especially when dealing in 240 characters. I don’t know why Atheists get lobbed in that area though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HowDoYouMakeAU2 @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Also you must be very soft of me saying you can’t read affects you that much. I am simply stating you didn’t read what I said about belief; you’re cherry picking my words like you do the Bible. Me choosing not to argue your point isn’t admiting your right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HowDoYouMakeAU2 @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Neither do you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@manic_tannic @jmcnaughtonjc @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump I love you; I gave up quickly on this guy. He’s my Uncle whose a Catholic or he reminds me of him anyways. I argue with that guy enough as it is. You’d have to pay me to debate this guy. I muted him no point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Milam3214 @SirBeefDOofLoin @jmcnaughtonjc @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump I’m not even bothering with this; have a nice life buddy. You are entitled to your own opinions not your own facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@te77is @SirBeefDOofLoin @jmcnaughtonjc @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump lol 😂 that’s your argument. Jesus Christ.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>He only gives a fuck about money. That’s pretty much the entire American media market.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@manic_tannic @jmcnaughtonjc @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump That was always my thoughts on the whole if there is a God pulling the strings. Believing in a God is on par with believing Aliens seeded the Earth. Granted the later could be a possibility whereas  the former just has a book written by flawed men with ZERO understanding of earth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish you the best of luck. I just know enough veterans in that state; they are unfortunately rather stubborn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dope shirt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man the religious people who think Atheists are the worst; yet preach constantly about God &amp; how we all should be saved don’t see how they’re doing the same thing they hate Atheists doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sun__kiss @jmcnaughtonjc @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Eh some Atheists are total fucking douche bags so I can understand somethings the religious gripe about. The others it’s a victim complex.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fuckyeahcollin Curious what’s funny? I mean enlighten me. You really believe that man is a Christian. He uses it as a tool a means to an end. Granted nothing I say here will change your mind. It’s a cult like mentality with his supporters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HowDoYouMakeAU2 @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump You can’t read can you? My best friend is Christian and would argue with you about that. I can make the same argument against the religious so what was your point exactly?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jazz_Fan_76 I use the Book of Job as a point all the time. Why did your God feel need to barter &amp; make a bet with Lucifer? His creation; why did he have to ruin someone’s life to prove a point. Who gives a shit that “God” have it back 10 fold or whatever it was. Bottom line it’s not for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sun__kiss @jmcnaughtonjc @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump I do and I mentioned in another tweet my stance. Keep it out of schools unless educational &amp; on all religions &amp; the history with it. Otherwise it’s a personal thing &amp; shouldn’t be dictating others lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aspynthemermaid I’m sorry Im sending positive thoughts. I never reported my cousin because the anxiety swells so badly even thinking about it. I can’t imagine how you or others are feeling. The lack of accountability is making me question pro wrestling as whole. I hope your day gets better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soulidt Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EFFYlives  https://t.co/G2bpTSQmpi<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMikeBennett Personally it’s similar for me. Been to so many live events and always meet new friends. It’s really rare to come across a douche bag for me personally, but I am the type to call you out if I see some dumb shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhoenixAEW @ThisBrodieLee @MoxxleyCrue Best part of San Diego is the tacos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So is @EricTrump saying he’s gay? Good for him? I mean I’m kinda confused here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jazz_Fan_76 Exactly as a veteran I’ll always support your right to your religion, but that doesn’t mean you get to dictate aspects of my life. You do what works for you &amp; keep it out of schools &amp; Government (unless teaching all religions for historical purposes.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmcnaughtonjc @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump ok Karen this is the only response you’ll get. Frankly this wasn’t even worth the time it took to type but here we are. I’d argue I’m more Christ like then you. I advocate for the poor &amp; would help if able to. I believe in women being equal to men in all things. I could go on...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tony is awesome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dylan_Bostic Nope but one day these podcasts will be profitable. Probably after I finish my political science degree &amp; some business courses or media of some kind. VA has me at 100% unemployable but it’s just not enough raising 2 kids. I’m optimistic though not sure why lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SohrabAhmari This guy right here is why I am an Atheist. My generation is the least religious because of people like this guy. Please buddy keep being this way; you only help us Atheists lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump His Christian supporters are proof to me I made the right choice in being an Atheist. Then again that wasn’t really a choice it was more of a journey to a point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No shit he does; that’s why I laugh at all the Christians who support Trump. He’s an Atheist &amp; the worst kind of one too. Even in my circle we have the shitty people too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahahahaha I love your mom this is great<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just saw too many comments bullying the guy &amp; it’s clearly gingers are still getting shitted on 24/7. My skin is thick but not everyone’s is so let’s think just a tad bit more people about the impact our words have. I never say anything here I would say to your face.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Liberals in Santee, Ca relax I am a veteran yes, but reading the Art of War shouldn’t startle some of you like it has lol.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I’m really flattered; Ginger Jesus is Lord is trending.  https://t.co/BPuHRSofLq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck Yes I want this; but Im poor. VA compensation doesn’t exactly make you rich nor has my Podcasts yet so alas I must wait.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast Trust me I am not happy but what else can I do? Ca and Santee particularly is Trump country. I can’t move because I raise 2 kids of compensation from the VA with ZERO child support. I’m stuck and have no options.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s why everyone makes Handmaids Tale jokes at the @GOP because alot of their base would love that. Not all but enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What makes me angry for this man is a few of you on here could easily help this guy. The priorities in this country are all fucked up.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SwoleWorld As a father of a little girl this infuriates me beyond reason. The cops and those who did the swatting. I mean Jesus Christ do the cops lack common sense too.

<|startoftext|>The money and if he is to go down it will be because he owes the government a fuck load of money. That said I have ZERO faith in our justice system especially for white collar crimes. The rich need to be held accountable by the voters or they will keep taking from us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump paid more taxes than me but that’s sad he was able to get away with that. I receive compensation from the VA which is non taxed(as it should be) and so I fall under non filer status. @realDonaldTrump is like every other rich person who dodged taxes. I’ve always said follow<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Seriously @TwitterSupport explain to me what I did wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a former Catholic I can explain rather easily just not in 240 characters. I was confirmed as well, but when the church got busted hiding pedo’s what did it do? Yes a few since have been prosecuted but not as many as should have been. It’s also filthy rich; not very Jesus like.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Cox30Cox @joegehret Praying to someone like me is literally a slap in the face. It says I hear your pain but don’t really want to take concrete action to change it. I don’t judge it’s members as harshly as I judge the church. The Mormon church is having a similar issue. They are better at hiding it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/VRD1Cm6gQ5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ByGraceAlone @westerninfidel Wow you went off left field I see no point in continuous conversation. You already told me your morality is based on a book written by flawed men who didn’t understand the world they lived in. Take care I don’t hate your types; just don’t like when you try to dictate my life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ByGraceAlone @westerninfidel That scares me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ByGraceAlone @westerninfidel Furthermore I respect people who adopt but so many don’t. You’re are 2 cases out of so many that don’t. My family is incredibly religious and none of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ByGraceAlone @westerninfidel Again see my previous comment on Adopting. The trump supporter comment was more of a jab because as someone who was raised Catholic how you support him is beyond me. I didn’t just wake up and go I think I am an Atheist. I let the actions of his followers lead me here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@westerninfidel As a Catholic you learn the church of God is everywhere. So in theory at least how you love to use the Bible  to make points. Im just doing the same. I can do this all day lady; I’ve actually read the thing cover to cover a few times. I also have a Koran too and a Book of Mormon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ByGraceAlone @westerninfidel Are you fit to be a mother or father? The state has background checks for reasons. The thing so you’re one person; so many don’t want to foster or adopt. Some Christians do nothing but adopt and I respect that. People like this woman are indoctrinated &amp; don’t really make sense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@westerninfidel The women should keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be in submission, as the Law also says. Again you cherry pick your own religion to attempt to make points. I can do this as well. I own a Bible &amp; have actually read it. You speak up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@westerninfidel What’s that? What case in point are you making?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@westerninfidel also been with two women who got abortions. I also never stated I would personally get one in my original comment just that it’s our right and not yours to decide that. Both situations looking back I am glad it happened. She wasn’t built to be a mother &amp; she wanted it. Her body<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@westerninfidel the trump supporter talking about my moral compass is laughable. You people want these babies born, but when they are here you vote to cut programs that would help the poor not choose abortion. Spare me your save all children speech. Christians are hypocrites in this area<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ephesians 5:22 I believe   Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. Another words why are you on this app if you actually believe this crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let a woman learn quietly with all submissiveness. I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet. For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@westerninfidel The irony of this tweet is wonderful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not your place to make that choice for my daughter or the woman I am with. Your religious beliefs don’t trump my right period. Get over it cupcake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@westerninfidel So you fell from one cult to another? That’s not progress lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@conservmillen @westerninfidel No we don’t trust you there’s a difference<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2yrs 5 months. When my relationship ended I needed time to get my mind right. That took over a year &amp; then I was busy raising my kids(solo dad here) and then the fucking Rona. Looks like I’ll hit the 3yr mark lol. I’ve honestly forgotten what it feels like. This is sad...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It won’t do shit; haven’t you pundits figured this out yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Franklin_Graham Indoctrination so cool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mike_Pence No it’s not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Franklin_Graham I disagree completely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because there’s a history of that working...... When are species can finally get past this stage in pit development it will be beneficial to humanity as a whole. Religion has stunted our growth; that’s my opinion take it how you want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Supporters that are Christians want something very different then those on the left. It’s why the left Christians don’t worry me as much as those on the right. I often wonder if this country is the safest for me and my kids with these people around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I wonder how many claim to be trump supporters. Frankly Christian Trump supporters just remind me why I am an Atheist. The hypocrisy is so thick like tar thick. I wonder how many of them actually read the Bible or just cherry pick it. You’re entitled to belief but trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joegehret I went for years and left when they started not allowing priests to be prosecuted for raping kids. The church chose to hide this for decades. You don’t get to act like you have the moral high ground. Oh &amp; the wealth your church has amassed is against your Jesus &amp; his words<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kanyewest I want to thank you Ye you’re reminding why I am the Atheist I am. You will have to kill me to make me believe in this hocus pocus bullshit. I was Catholic so I am good on that crap. When a church allows the systematic raping of kids &amp; covers it up you lose all moral credibility<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe if your church didn’t try to wield the power or paid taxes on the billions in wealth;Maybe if your church allowed priests to be prosecuted for raping kids. Maybe if there was some sense of accountability in the church I wouldn’t have left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio Maybe if your church didn’t try to wield the power it does people wouldn’t trash it. Maybe if your church allowed priests to be prosecuted for raping kids. Maybe if you didn’t try to force your beliefs on the rest of us. This goes both ways genius.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Well the amount of the people I’ve served with over the 6yrs I was in;that were from New Jersey I would debate this rather throughly, but that’s my personal experiences and on one ship. I’d say it’s Arizona from my experiences in the states I’ve been too.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IM_Teena_Louise Jesus Christ my sexy really fucking pisses me off with this shit. This kind of behavior is why most times women don’t get into wrestling.

<|startoftext|>@PhoenixAEW My deployments ran me empty &amp; with wrestling particularly Mick Foley &amp; his first book &amp; a few DVDs I kept in my rack helped keep me sane. I was deployed watching wrestle mania 26 after we’d been out to sea for 3 months and up for 2 days. Worth it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhoenixAEW I met sting once when I was 14 he was super nice. nWo just debuted at No Way Out. I of course asked about him &amp; Taker like a 14 yr would. He was super kind.

<|startoftext|>I ask myself this daily<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TherealRVD Ahahahaha god damn I love RVD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thejbird904 @maskedbabyface Used to go by TheGingerProxy  https://t.co/V9oimNxc9x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhoenixAEW Wrestling saved my life a few times so I am trying to give more back especially in the community. It needs better from the men and myself included.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhoenixAEW Also thank you and your husband for always being so kind &amp; engaging. It’s honestly rubbing off on me &amp; Ive become less abrasive. I am terrible with people; Navy made it worse lol. Still figuring out this whole dissociative identity disorder thing. I mean it explains ALOT buy hard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhoenixAEW Well since you’re here and a fellow writer. I don’t have many people in my life I trust to be honest with me about my poems. If you find the time I would love some feed back; Of course if that’s not crossing a boundary. Here some are #poetrycommunity #Poems #writingheals  https://t.co/Brb847xbhX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ditto<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She’s right; dude knew what he was getting into. Men we gotta take some responsibility for our choices. It can’t always be the woman’s fault. Personally I want a woman who is testy &amp; viciously independent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeyHeyItsConrad The Hart Foundation in my early years and Hardy Boyz in my teens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhoenixAEW Damn autocorrect meant conduct no idea why it changed to construct lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>O’Reilly vs Cole if that’s what this leads too will be fucking delicious. Their #ROH match at #WrestleKingdom is definitely worth a watch. They had some great matches. If Finn wins fine there too he’s incredible. I just wish #WWE would lease #BulletClub or something with #NJPW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t get fans who do this. It’s fucking weird and I find it creepy you track these people down like this. They construct meet &amp; greets all of them. There is ZERO reason for this or to show up at someone’s house or mail shit to it(unless given that option of course) #Wrestling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@c_diamonddd Nope fuck that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cmclymer @CoreyinNYC I’m an Atheist so I’d never get elected in this country. Plus I’m a giant asshole and it takes time to warm up to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@giseletheweaver @DanhausenAD This doesn’t mean I have any intention of leaving. I’m just saying people are going to be coming one way or the other if Trump keeps going the way he is. It’s like he wants one &amp; so do his supporters. Then again some on the left are just as bad. This country has lost its mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@giseletheweaver @DanhausenAD I would; for me as an Atheist, veteran, independent, I don’t fit the America I currently live in. Should a Civil War break out you should be expecting more coming. Honestly the next year is going to be a shit show even more so then 2020. I wish my country would wake up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jordan32Shelby @SauceBhris And I get asked why I don’t fuck with white women anymore; exhibit A ; wow she fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Star Wars for me; particularly the Knights of the Old Republic era #StarWars #DisneyPlus #Disney It would be everything. I just need to get to film school somehow. I need to use all this EU knowledge for something. The Sith are my area; it’s probably why #EpisodeIX was a disaster<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be an Atheist than a fake Christian. I tried religion almost all of them but found them lacking in their convictions. I even own a Bible &amp; read it; but the more I study it the more the hypocrisy of its meme era become more evident.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of criticism. Too many religious people are indoctrinated with no clear understanding to how they got where they are. I could go for hours on this but you hopefully get my point. The religious right in this country use religion as a tool &amp; I shall too. The Pope said it’s better..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does. Look believe what you want. That’s fine by me Muslim, Christian, Hinduism etc. I’ve studied it all &amp; will continue to. However when Atheists tend to do what he’s doing here the religious across the board get rather upset. The double standard is annoying; religion isn’t free<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now last I checked he’s a Trump supporter; so this last part is really ironic when he says the things he does here.  “He said that even though believers have freedom in Christ, they should not use it as an excuse to please themselves” That’s literally what half the religious pop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AEWrestling @nwa @CodyRhodes vs @RealNickAldis III #AEW #NWA #AEWFullGear 30 mins Iron Man Match preferably. We just need the 3rd match for the trilogy. The first 2 were amazing matches; the story is there &amp; compelling. If Cody is the heel this time around it would add a layer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because of the types of people that live in Santee, Ca. Far too many racists and just generally shitty people who are selfish &amp; usually bigots in some fashion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I lived in Eureka Ca, there are redwoods and weed everywhere. Also hippies but they usually smelt like shit &amp; were a bit insane. You were outside playing unsupervised till it was dark lol. I live in Santee, Ca &amp; I wouldn’t trust my kids outside without my supervision to a point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexKoslovCom @MachineGunKA I am Dad too with two kids so I gotta keep things separate. Definitely no relationships I tried that lol. I don’t even recognize the dating scene these days lmao. When I was active duty it was like fishing with dynamite; maybe not mention I have kids? You’re awesome for this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sbayce52 @SwoleWorld Ah figures you hide behind no profile picture. Talk shit to my face coward I am in Santee Ca. I doubt you’ve even served go ahead lie to me. I’ve heard all the lies about serving or why you couldn’t. This is the only response you’ll get coward.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>⁦@MachineGunKA⁩ ⁦@AlexKoslovCom⁩ I’ve been single 2 1/2 yrs. Was my 1st time in love at 34 lol. I need Koslov love advice immediately; I’ve forgotten what the snatch even feels like :( lmao. Is Tinder &amp; Bumble the answer?  https://t.co/uU9DpWrh9W<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eugenegu And look how that went lol. It went horrible for years that’s your argument?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr You don’t know him clearly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I keep getting how were you so right? It wasn’t hard to see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump is a traitor if no other reason then this right here. He needs to go and immediately(well Nov. 3rd)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stellakae Great loved it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/4c6UGp3AsT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stellakae I’m sorry that’s shitty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarmineSabia Wow lies shocker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kurteichenwald @MittRomney No they don’t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MittRomney You’re spineless for posting this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KyleHooten2 Lol ok Karen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DashingChrisBey I’m a cancer whatever that means<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/5q6DOLFGc5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SassyCanadianEh Yeah it’s been easy getting almost everyone back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The_MJF @MjfScarf  https://t.co/ih2KAat1dF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllEliteTiffany Yep got my TheGingerProxy account suspended some how. Really blows was close to 500 but all well the Podcast.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWENXT @KORcombat @FinnBalor Why not Halloween Havoc?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KristinaSnowden @WrestleJoy Agreed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeslieSmith_GF Colby is too stupid for that. Sure he kicked my ass but that doesn’t change the fact he’s in cult &amp; sounds like a racist. Then you add what you’ve mentioned &amp; it’s even stupider.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/FgA12BDX4z<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwoleWorld As a fellow veteran it hurts me talking to my brothers and sisters I would die for seeing the pain they are in and people’s disgusting reactions to your righteous anger. Something has to change this isn’t what I served for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AEWrestling Thunder Rosa vs @SwoleWorld pretty please #AEW #NWA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SassyCanadianEh Same it’s bullshit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jessithebuckeye I had to create a new account<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/4Er6fCQqji<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly racism isn’t genetic though with some southerners it’s debatable ;) but seriously it’s taught. Thankfully my children as well will conduct themselves as humans in this way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeddiTurnbuckle I hope so Teddy; I worked hard for that follow lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Puf is glorious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jessithebuckeye Congratulations again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amazing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WasabiRyo Jelly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhoenixAEW Had to get a new account lol  https://t.co/hwV6C7aHSU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listen to "No Preferred Nomenclature Episode 10 - It's Gonna Get Uncomfortable / #SpeakingOut" from Recluse Podcast Network  on @anchor:  https://t.co/E7fvFWFwI8 #Anchor #California #America #BLM #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>but does another. My recommendation is buy it used or wait for the price drop. It’s not a terrible game but it definitely needs some work in my opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As fun as Tony Hawk is at times; it’s not worth $50. The balance was annoying in the original games it’s worse here. I’ve had the blue thing straight tank before I can even balance after like 2 tricks. The game feels clunky at times when trying to get the skater to do one thing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I stopped playing because the cheating is so bad #CallOfDuty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kerrywashington I will vote on everything local and state. The Federal will do nothing as I am in CA &amp; I understand the electoral college, gerrymandering, lobbyists &amp; corporate democrats who say nice things IE Biden but it’s the same shit every 4 yrs. Biden May get my vote; Trump will never.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cj13Cool @common Man that’s sad you have this outlook on White people. I get it; but I would take a bullet for the men &amp; women I served with. They know I’d move mountains to help in anyway I can. Segregation definitely isn’t an answer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ad70Wally @10TV Just stop Boomer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rbforamerica @SauceBhris First off I live here and have since 2003. I know that was Alpine; I just didn’t care enough to clarify because I saw it in Santee too. I didn’t need to research because I did see it in Santee if you know the area you know both places have issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@briantylercohen Here’s the thing how are poor people like myself supposed to afford a electric car? This does nothing but create more problems &amp; reeks of grandstanding cause he wants to run for President. Fuck Newsom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DashingChrisBey It’s so precious I don’t get why more people don’t look at life that way. You’d spend less time on people who aren’t worth it. I’m an Atheist so this life is it for me. I’ll be damned if anyone tells me how to live it. Love your work man &amp; can’t wait to see you World Champ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MadKing1981 @TonyKhan @AEWonTNT  https://t.co/iwmQSciUDf<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheJessieWoo Well that’s cause it isn’t real. Why do you think him &amp; Trump supporters use God so much? It’s a tool and the powerful understand this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benshapiro Good news you’re hypocrite<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods And you’re a joke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahlugor Is that a good thing? Im a cancer and never really looked it up. Maybe it’s the Atheist in me that stays away from this stuff I dunno.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love this tag team<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus Christ my anxiety is not ok. I’m a parent and there has been a few days where I had to hide from my kids so I could compose myself. I can’t let them see me weak at this time. They need me as a rock since it’s only me with a 14yr old boy &amp; 10yr old girl. This hurts me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listen to the most recent episode of my podcast: Internal Thoughts that were dipped in ADHD....oh and BLACK LIVES MATTER   https://t.co/McYvsYj00E #BlackLivesMatter #America #California #Democrats #Republicans #Veterans #PodcastRecommendations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I loved these two movies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fucking losers #Louisville<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeanRossSapp Man some of them are salty; you weren’t kidding this is hilarious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got nothing; I agree. I can’t even play devil’s advocate on this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ryansatin WWE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyNemmity I was suspended<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You heard her<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jazz needs to be respected by us fans more. She was fantastic &amp; I enjoyed the #WrestleMania X-8 match she had as well as countless others. She has some great stuff out there if you just look #NWA too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes it is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CandidlyCandy_ I live in Santee, Ca and this was in Alpine, Ca nothing disgusts me more especially as a veteran whose deployed to a few times. I am rapidly losing faith in my country &amp; the white people in it. It’s not all bad but there’s enough.  https://t.co/BQNkA821UI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaxFreedom81 @SauceBhris Yes I served it’s Navy there is a big problem with racism in this country. I served for 6yrs with people across this country. Sure the Navy kicked out the obvious ones, but the ones who knew to hide it but only show enough stayed. I live in Santee Ca &amp; there’s plenty of Nazi’s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And @ColbyCovMMA you don’t speak for most veterans so shut the fuck up about doing anything for us. Also have a Marine sitting near me telling you’re a twat &amp; he was a grunt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My pet deposit was $400 so yeah it’s bullshit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Franklin_Graham No God isn’t and stop trying to shove it down people’s throats. Remaining secular is our best hope. You practice your religion but don’t be imposing your beliefs on others. You Christians go postal when us Atheists do this; straight hypocrisy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SauceBhris I live in Klantee...I mean Santee Ca and we have mother fuckers out here doing this shit. As a veteran nothing disgusts me more than this bullshit. As a white man I support BLM because of the obvious &amp; my brothers I served with. They are my family; I’d take a bullet for them.  https://t.co/ku73qJtgd7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsmeheythere I wish I knew what that meant; told I am a cancer still haven’t looked it up lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pufisgod Puf is the greatest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She’s sassy for a Catholic I like this. I mean the Pope himself said &amp; I paraphrase “it’s better to be an Atheist than a fake Christian” people like Trump &amp; Barr and even lesser people like Sarah Huckabee Sanders or Meghan McCain have made me the Atheist I am. The hypocrisy wow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bullshit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SauceBhris I wish he was wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Black lives mean less than a neighbor’s walls in #Louisville #BlackLivesMatter  more then someone’s wall. The fact the other 2 faced no charges is why the protests won’t stop anytime soon. This is wrong on so many levels; all the cops belong in jail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhoenixAEW I got suspended back at ZERO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HillaryClinton What would help is if you went away. You’re the type of Democrat that lead people to vote for him in The first place. Lying about sniper fire says VOLUMES about who you are. Please just retire &amp; debt your husbands a creep. I regret my vote for you on so many levels<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ll be back later I am still so damn pissed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dope<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why even bother they don’t give a shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously consider blowing my god damn brains out. I honestly don’t know how much more I can take. It’s been 3 months total &amp; the VA took 2 just to get my first PT appointment. Still no MRI done though they think I tore it. I shouldn’t be using it but what else am I to do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep on top of back issues, knee issues(have had 1 surgery so far) and now my rotator cuff. I am@100% by the VA &amp; that is nice; however CA isn’t cheap &amp; I’m raising two kids. It’s definitely a daily battle to be even remotely functional. The pain especially my shoulder makes me...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She is so good at it; I need to get better without getting suspended lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My body is in worse shape now. If it’s not my knees it’s my back and now my rotator cuff. I just wish someone would actually give a fuck at the VA. I honestly am just lost and am rambling now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Americans #Veterans #CountryOverParty then the stress of everything else as well. I just feel like giving up, the thing is I have 2 kids I am raising so I am stuck. Can’t off myself and don’t know how much longer I can stand this pain &amp; depression on top of it. Been out 8yrs...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am just done with this app and everyone on it. There so are many of you that are wonderful but after getting suspended again &amp; now having to rebuild my followers again to hopefully get a few of them to listen or support the podcast is draining my mental capacity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surface care but not really; I don’t know how many times I’ve mentioned the amount of pain I am in for my rotator cuff &amp; yep the @DeptVetAffairs in La Jolla is dragging its feet on an MRI. I can’t sleep and I can’t work cause the VA has me unemployable. No one actually cares...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Wrestling #WrestlingCommunity #WrestlingTwitter Well the Ginger Proxy got suspended before some right wingers did but that’s Twitter for you. Once this account is suspended I am fucking done with this app screw it. It hasn’t helped my podcasts one fucking bit, people here...<|endoftext|>
