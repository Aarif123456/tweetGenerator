<|startoftext|>And the other five customers were not properly covering their noses with their masks!  Is abiding by these simple requirements to provide protection for all really THAT difficult?!  And when I left the store, the employee stationed at the exit...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sadly, however, not even two minutes after entering #Walmart, I observed at least half a dozen customers and at least one employee violating the ‚Äúhouse rules‚Äù:  one woman moved her mask to hang around her neck, the employee wasn‚Äôt covering his nose...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It‚Äôs not about #Masks4All but wearing them properly to help slow the spread of #Covid_19. Before entering @Walmart today, an employee instructed anyone walking into the store, to leave one‚Äôs mask on at all times covering mouth and nose.<|endoftext|>

All the casinos now have sanitizing stations. A little inconvenience is in the best interest of all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@its_ryanp @mickakers Well, one could lift their mask momentarily to drink or remove mask in a designated smoking area. But when walking through the casinos or playing, every guest should have on a mask...just as it‚Äôs mandatory for all employees. We are all in this together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mickakers I‚Äôm sorry, but it‚Äôs VERY disturbing that masks aren‚Äôt required for all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SDougMorg, make it mandatory!  ‚ÄúBut I would have liked to see more patrons wearing masks, in all honesty.‚Äù   https://t.co/88CwCmjtp3 #LasVegas #Casinos #FlattenTheCurve #COVID19<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@UniversalORL, in their grand re-opening, smartly requires all guests to wear masks. Wake up, #LasVegas!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Again, safety for ALL should be of utmost importance in this world in which we currently live with a virus that does not discriminate. Until there‚Äôs effective treatment or a cure, the most prudent thing to do is require everyone to wear masks. @mickakers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay, so people want to smoke.  Fine. But couldn‚Äôt there be designated smoking areas within the casinos such as those offered at sporting events and airports?  Or, do what @parkmgm recently announced in a fully smoke-free hotel/casino upon reopening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn‚Äôt the goal to keep everyone safe?  Don‚Äôt you want the #COVID19 curve of both cases and deaths to continue to flatten?  I can‚Äôt think of a single business that hasn‚Äôt required both customers and employees to wear masks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovSisolak &amp; the Nevada Gaming Commission, it‚Äôs great seeing life returning to #LasVegas with the reopening of the casinos, but wouldn‚Äôt it have made (more) sense to make masks mandatory for guests, too, as they are for employees? @WynnLasVegas<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lisaabramowicz1, to your guest now on #BloombergRadio, the Fed could just reinvigorate buying of long-term US Treasuries to keep long rates lower for longer if fiscal policy comes into play again.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PWSullivan @MDGonzales ‚Äú18. Pedro Strop The usually dependable late-inning reliever has seen his role diminish during the worst season of his Cubs career. What are the chances of seeing Strop on a postseason roster at this rate?‚Äù    I‚Äôll answer now:  ZERO!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the @Cubs do indeed make the playoffs and Strop makes the post-season roster, #Cubs management should be fired.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The lowest average monthly curve inversion (3m10y) in the 12m prior to start of the Great Recession was -51bp.  Currently, this month‚Äôs average inversion is about -33bp after averaging -14 in June and -8 in July. @biancoresearch @EconguyRosie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliebilello While this is symbolic &amp; has garnished a lot of attention after briefly inverting in mid-Jun for the 1st time since Nov ‚Äò16, the most predictable recession indicator is the slope of the 3m/10y...which has been inverted, on average, in Jun, Jul &amp; now Aug. @biancoresearch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EconguyRosie The data I‚Äôve read (per the NY Fed) is that it‚Äôs been 100% accurate for the last seven recessions since 1968 when the curve (3m10y) has inverted on average for at least 3 months in the 12 months preceding a recession.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the @Cubs make the playoffs, who gets the ball in G1 (either WC game or the NLDS)?  #Cubs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sonalibasak Need more than one week. Just not enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@biancoresearch How much ‚Äúis enough‚Äù to get the Fed to cut more aggressively or to get DJT to back off some of these tariff threats?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just after this morning‚Äôs remarks from Chair Powell, the odds, per WIRP on BBG, of a 50bp cut next month, were a low 6.6%. Currently, the odds have jumped to 20%. @biancoresearch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two days ago, the WH denied there was any tax cut talk. Yesterday, they said they were thinking about it. Now, they‚Äôre no longer looking at them. But what hasn‚Äôt changed:  slamming the Federal Reserve!  @crampell<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MDGonzales ‚ÄúYeah‚Äù, Mr. Hoyer, but the @Cubs still have 41 road games left this season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crimsonace @GDubCub #FinanciallyConstrained<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crimsonace @GDubCub Agree to both points. I repeat my first statement: ‚ÄúBP is not playoff caliber. Heck, not even Little League caliber.‚Äù<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crimsonace @GDubCub Refer to point 1.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GDubCub 4. They can‚Äôt win on the road.  5. JM juggles the lineup too much.  6. JM still goes to Strop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GDubCub Lemme start the ‚Äúslams‚Äù on the Cubs: 1. BP is not playoff caliber. Heck, not even Little League caliber. 2. Offense too inconsistent. K too much.  3. SP very unreliable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bullard:  Fed doesn‚Äôt need to take inter-meeting action. @biancoresearch @zerohedge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What do you make of this, @biancoresearch?   https://t.co/hUFG0K3kmh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crampell, to your comments on @AC360 about the yield curve...look to history... last 7 recessions, 3m/10y slope (most reliable) inverts, on avg, at least 3x in the 12 months preceding a recession. May, June, July all negative &amp; Aug is headed that way, too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So would @realDonaldTrump be as vocal/critical had he left Yellen in charge of the Federal Reserve? @EconguyRosie @biancoresearch<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Maybe the @Cubs should wear their home uniforms when playing on the road. #Cubs @GDubCub @MDGonzales @ESPNChiCubs @DavidHaugh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDGonzales Fact:  you‚Äôre going to face the best teams and the best pitching in the playoffs.    Problem:  the #Cubs continue to SO far too much (10th in MLB, 4th in NL).  The Cubs are middle-of-the-pack in MLB in terms of runs scored.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now what?  #Cubs @GDubCub @MDGonzales @DavidHaugh @ESPNChiCubs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The old saying:  I went to a fight the other night, and a hockey game broke out. Well, watching a fight tonight, and a Democratic debate broke out.  @CNN #DebatesCNN @NHL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDGonzales Hoyer:  ‚Äúwith Strop... fingers crossed. ... cautiously optimistic (he‚Äôs demoted to AAA).‚Äù  (Note:  Hoyer didn‚Äôt really say this.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Brojan_ @GDubCub Close enough. Substitute Weak then. Weak, Wreck...whatever it takes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GDubCub Hopefully Wieck won‚Äôt be known as ‚ÄúWreck‚Äù for the #Cubs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GDubCub ‚ÄúSome work‚Äù?  Well, at least we don‚Äôt have CEJ anymore down there to show him how to pitch in pressure situations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GDubCub 6.57 ERA and a 1.42 WHIP...meets the minimum standards of earning a job in the @Cubs bullpen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now that the @Cubs have acquired an everyday player in Castellanos, who now sits in the overly crowded #Cubs outfield?  @GDubCub @MDGonzales @ESPNChiCubs @DavidHaugh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ckamka @GDubCub @baseball_ref Good thing the Cubs aren‚Äôt piecing together a basketball team!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sure seems as if this presser has made things more confusing than ever!  What happened to ‚Äúclarity‚Äù from the Fed...especially now that Powell decided to hold a presser after each FOMC meeting?!  @biancoresearch @zerohedge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDGonzales And, thankfully, the #Cubs addressed the surplus catching situation today...but for another (utility) outfielder?!  Come on...the bullpen is still in need of help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zerohedge So you‚Äôre saying if they only cut 25bp, out of the gate, we don‚Äôt enter a recession?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDGonzales Can the @Cubs move JM to the IL?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@670TheScore The old, mysterious, unexplainable,  JM ‚Äúhe‚Äôs fine‚Äù injury, eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TommyBirch @MDGonzales He hasn‚Äôt even appeared in the prior two games since demoted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDGonzales Senseless to have three catchers on the active roster when the BP is THE most pressing concern.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fascinating that Kimbrel, in his last two seasons in Boston, making a combined 130 appearances, had just one loss, but in 12 appearances as a #Cubs he already has 2 losses.  @GDubCub @MDGonzales<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitchinam @DavidHaugh Ya don‚Äôt fire players, but do so with managers/coaches. JM absolutely makes too many REALLY questionable, head-scratching decisions with respect to the lineup, starting pitching and, of course, the turnstile of a BP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidHaugh And, to finish off your thought, David:  JM needs to be let go. (Tough for you to be too harsh on the Cubs since you work for the Cubs‚Äô flagship radio network.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MorrisseyCST Please, Rick, write a scathing article on how lousy of a manager JM is and the really questionable moves TE has made.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDGonzales Well, at least it wasn‚Äôt Strop blowing it (for once). Concerning, though, Kimbrel‚Äôs outing tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDGonzales JM‚Äôs lineup juggling ‚Äúat its best‚Äù.  This is as ridiculous as using Strop in a tight-game situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidHaugh Instead of being hypercritical of the Cubs‚Äô bats and the BP...why don‚Äôt you go after JM‚Äôs questionable managerial decisions...yet again?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidHaugh Uh, who made the decision to put Strop in, David?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GDubCub The Cubs‚Äô next roster move must involve demoting Strop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ESPNChiCubs Strop &amp; CEJ should be roommates down in AAA.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Lots of ‚Äúfireworks‚Äù on the 4th of July:  Maddon ejected earlier, and ready to rumble, and the #Cubs are putting up a ton of runs! @GDubCub @MDGonzales<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But I must say, I think a key factor into the @Cubs inconsistencies is a result of the jigsaw puzzle of a lineup JM puts together:  guys just don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôll be playing, what slot hitting and where playing the field.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And Addy being out of today‚Äôs lineup is because Garcia‚Äôs getting the start JM mentioned before yesterday‚Äôs game...though one could make the case Addy should be sitting today for that defensive blunder in the 9th inning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thekapman, I‚Äôve had the same thoughts as you but, as you can see, JM didn‚Äôt bother benching yesterday‚Äôs non-hustling JB and WC.  https://t.co/9HL2B1Ni3X<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Just like with Craig Kimbrel on the north side, he puts you in a better position to win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has Stan Bowman just become ‚Äúthe man‚Äù again for the @NHLBlackhawks ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wonder if today‚Äôs early morning odds of the Blackhawks winning the Cup increase from 40:1 (per  https://t.co/0XcSk8okv0) post the Lehner acquisition?  @SatchelPrice @Tramyers_NHL @CRoumeliotis @MarkLazerus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus But the Hawks could still do something to sign another non-game changing winger if they can move Anisimov.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SatchelPrice Lots of numbers sloshing around with trades and whatnot, but are they gonna avoid mucking things up to extend the üê± and Strome LT deals?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus If you‚Äôre referring to KD he‚Äôs, apparently, signing with the NJ Nets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Our PK was really bad last season but hopefully should be much improved with the re-tooling on D. I‚Äôm saying this because, historically, Shaw has taken his fair share of bad penalties.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus @Tramyers_NHL Just don‚Äôt bring back Laz‚Äôs ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù, Jeremy Morin!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SaraCivian @MarkLazerus @ByScottPowers Had the Blackhawks selected Byram in the Draft, would they have consummated a trade such as this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SatchelPrice What about @9Artemi?  He sure would fit in nicely, again, pairing up with Kane...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus BH make a run at @9Artemi?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GDubCub ‚ÄúAnyone, anyone‚Äù gonna get on base?  #ferrisbueller<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fans leaving the arena prior to presentation of the Cup is just silly. @StLouisBlues @NHLBruins @NHL #NHL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMattPierucci @MDGonzales Yeah, must be YD‚Äôs ‚Äúgreat‚Äù ERA, WHIP,  HR/9 innings, BB/9 innings...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmuckChuck @MDGonzales Excluding last night‚Äôs game, where the Cubs scored just one run, in YD‚Äôs previous two outings, the Cubs scored a total of 12 runs (8 in a win, 4 in a loss).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDGonzales Yes, but zero wins since the end of April.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus @Tramyers_NHL @HowlerCoyote (Joking) Maybe the company is having difficulty sourcing parts due to the current trade fiasco with China. üò¨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tramyers_NHL @MarkLazerus @HowlerCoyote Not a monopolistic business. Surely there are many other plumbers willing, and able, to help (sooner, rather than later).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GDubCub We supposed to guess which word?  Flipping?  Farting?  Functioning?  Frustrating?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GDubCub Sure looks like, with those stats, he‚Äôd fit right in now with the big club!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is a 10-run lead enough for the @Cubs‚Äô bullpen?  @GDubCub @MDGonzales<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDGonzales @IowaCubs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDGonzales But when you throw a juicy one right down the plate like that, it means trouble.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tramyers_NHL Agree that the Reese‚Äôs Mini PB Cups are fantastic frozen, but the full-sized two pack gives me much more satisfaction!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tramyers_NHL But are they frozen...because there‚Äôs no better way to consume?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDGonzales Maybe Yu Darvish can throw some early strike zone warmups.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidHaugh @NHLBlackhawks Looking at tonight‚Äôs NBA game reminded me that the @warriors Stephen Curry was a 1st round, 7th overall pick in 2009...and look how darn good he‚Äôs become!  So, while it‚Äôs unfortunate the Bulls didn‚Äôt get a higher pick, the reality is they could still draft a player with upside.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidHaugh Hey, but at least the @NHLBlackhawks got a huge win on lottery position day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDGonzales A. Why not just let KH finish the game (or at least attempt to close it out)? B. CEJ and TC warming up in the bullpen should not give Cubs‚Äô fans confidence.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GDubCub What‚Äôs he gonna say...that the bullpen is unreliable?!  That they suck?!  What irks me the most is the fact that these guys are paid huge sums of money to throw strikes and how badly they are struggling to do so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Small sample size, but who would have thought five games in that the @whitesox would have a better record than the @cubs?  @GDubCub @Kevbo_ @MDGonzales @DavidHaugh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Death, taxes and the @Cubs bullpen‚Äôs inability to hold a lead are the three things guaranteed in life. @MDGonzales @GDubCub @DavidHaugh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cubs At this rate, the @Cubs may be out of contention by their first home stand!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDGonzales &amp; @GDubCub - it‚Äôs safe to say that this is going to be a LONG @Cubs season! @TUMStweets #Frustration @MLB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidHaugh David, at least you have a hot topic to run to the top of the ‚Äú5 at 5‚Äù:  the Cubs bullpen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDGonzales THAT‚ÄôS the good news.  The bad?  The faith in our bullpen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today‚Äôs definition of the word #sarcasm:  Theo and team did a great job upgrading the @Cubs‚Äô bullpen this offseason. @GDubCub @MDGonzales<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the heck is Maddon talking about?!  Spring Training don‚Äôt mean diddly!  CEJ‚Äôs September WHIP, for example, was over 2.5, so looks like CEJ could be continuing that awful trend. @MLBastian @MDGonzales @GDubCub @Cubs  https://t.co/oqymaXhaAG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My confidence and patience with the @Cubs‚Äô bullpen is truly being tested two games into the season.  @GDubCub @MDGonzales<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In his 9th career start as a @Cubs, Darvish tonight pitched his shortest stint. His previous low as a #Cubs was 4 IP, and now 66.6% of his starts have gone less than 5 IP. @GDubCub @MDGonzales<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did Darvish take pitching lessons from Chatwood?! @GDubCub @MDGonzales @Cubs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GDubCub @MarkPotash Hmm...what about deGrom (5yr/$137.5mm):  6 IP, 0 R, 0 ER, 5 H, 1 BB, 10 K and gets the W?  I‚Äôd say he had one heck of a day!  @Mets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GDubCub Great W!  And I was so close in my prediction!  https://t.co/pqMMpiOhuf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last year, the Cubs didn‚Äôt score at least 6 runs in a single inning until their 14th game of the season. Accomplished that in game one this season. @GDubCub @MDGonzales @Cubs #Cubs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDGonzales Hopefully that contract extension was signed AFTER he was out and results known!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rileyyensingg @MDGonzales Yeah. @GDubCub clarified.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDGonzales For whom?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I ‚Äúsee‚Äù the C!  https://t.co/MH8iYXawoF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Speaking of ‚Äútanks‚Äù, they actually have a pretty cool aquarium (2,000-gallon) inside the BMW Lounge at the Shark Tank.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NHLBlackhawks I‚Äôm very familiar with that area at the Shark Tank!  https://t.co/ESTW0EFUog<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Less than 2% now. @Tramyers_NHL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Well, before today‚Äôs game,  https://t.co/w8MztJqTop calculated only a 5% chance the Blackhawks make the playoffs. Surely, and don‚Äôt call me Shirley (‚ÄúAirplane!‚Äù reference), those odds haven‚Äôt improved after losing today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbicks29 and @DaveBolland, just reminiscing about the #Blackhawks today and wanted to thank you both for the goal you each scored during those intense 17 seconds in Boston to clinch another Stanley Cup in 2013!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus A good friend‚Äôs son won the SCAHA title on that rink!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yankeesboy26 @JonHeyman No, I was saying it was ‚Äúover‚Äù as in the money was spread out ‚Äúover‚Äù 13 years...not that the contract was longer than 13 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yankeesboy26 @JonHeyman Yes, but his average per year is less because Harper‚Äôs contract is apparently over 13 years with no opt-out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MendocinoFarms @mikegleich10 @CityofSanRamon Oh, yeah!  I do love sandwiches!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikegleich10 @MendocinoFarms @CityofSanRamon I knew they weren‚Äôt open for business yet. I was trying to be funny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Guess I got that wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope @MendocinoFarms makes better sandwiches than displaying corporate signs!  @CityofSanRamon  https://t.co/Ir6Uc0RRTD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus #Sarcasm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GDubCub So he ‚Äúbelted‚Äù it, eh?  I‚Äôm ‚Äúsure‚Äù Chatwood is still just working on his pitch selection...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tramyers_NHL I say 5% probability or less that Cro plays another game for the BH this season...or ever again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDGonzales Illogical. JH is NOT a good hitter let alone a reasonable choice to leadoff.   Almora, when he plays, would be a much better choice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Well, if those boxes have already been sold, but not delivered, you‚Äôll be able to withstand the temptation. However, if they‚Äôre still ‚Äúavailable for sale‚Äù, you might want to consider taking a long walk right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who‚Äôs more likely to have a big rebound 2019 season? @Cubs #Cubs @MDGonzales @GDubCub @PJ_Mooney<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What‚Äôs been the leading factor elevating Strome‚Äôs overall game:  a system change, scenery change or linemate change?  @MarkLazerus @Tramyers_NHL @SatchelPrice @CRoumeliotis #Blackhawks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDGonzales Yes, but is that ‚Äúchance‚Äù closer to 1% or 99%?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tramyers_NHL There are serious infrastructure needs nationwide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Currently, as of this very moment, Kane is now in a two-way tie for the NHL scoring lead.   @NHLBlackhawks @MarkLazerus @ByScottPowers @Tramyers_NHL @SatchelPrice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tramyers_NHL Woulda read cooler if you said:  ‚ÄúKane with his 33rd of the season at 3:33 of the 3rd period!‚Äù<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Kevbo_ üî•<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madkenney Ridiculous. Wrigley Field is a money-making machine and the Cubs, on their own, are very profitable. Milwaukee is clearly the team to beat. On paper, the Cubs still should be very competitive. Hopefully the offense will be more consistent this upcoming season.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NBCSBlackhawks Fair, but would have been cool to also see the üêà get the nod, too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2ndCityHockey ‚ÄúShocking‚Äù!  Surely correlated between where the team currently is in the standings, versus where the Hawks were the last chunk of years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tramyers_NHL Or someone gave him a (motivational) grade of D+. @MarkLazerus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2ndCityHockey Didn‚Äôt look like Kaner used one of his classic Kaner moves and, as such, Rask, made a relatively easy save.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Tramyers_NHL I guess that extra 14 pounds in Martinsen may make a difference today?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCSChicago @NBCSBlackhawks So I guess one doesn‚Äôt qualify as an ‚ÄúAuthentic Fan‚Äù if he/she doesn‚Äôt reside in the Midwestern U.S.?!  That stinks!  ‚Äú... physically residing in Illinois, Iowa, Indiana and Wisconsin...‚Äù<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SatchelPrice Personally, I would have gone with the hot hand, or glove, in this case. CD has played well enough, beyond expectations actually, to earn the start. Plus, there was enough time to rest ahead of this game.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheAthletic Why is is that when I tap on this offer, I see the 50% discount, but when I share this offer with someone else (either by sending the tweet to text/email or just copying &amp; pasting the embedded web link), the offer shows as just 40% off?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ellie_lange @Cubs Love the Cubs, loathe that song! @madkenney<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus And, listen, the way to make that happen (not to play hockey) is for him to attack a woman rather than a man (on ice). THEN, perhaps, the Caps would release him and potentially that‚Äôd be the end of his NHL career.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In his last four games as a #Blackhawks, Schmaltz had a total of four shots on goal. In just his first period as a member of the @NHLBlackhawks, Strome already has two shots on goal. #JustSayin #CautiouslyOptomistic @ByScottPowers @CRoumeliotis<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@madkenney Is that him against the glass?  Just curious how you noticed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NHLBlackhawks And 15 minutes to go until the @megamillions drawing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2ndCityHockey I have that one on video tape. That game was super close to becoming a bench-clearing situation when the @StLouisBlues had the extra skater on the ice (Rod Brind'Amour) doing whatever they could to try and two-on-one the young @Jeremy_Roenick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NHLBlackhawks A little ‚ÄúCat‚Äù fight?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Tramyers_NHL Hmm, somebody‚Äôs gotta check the official stats as ‚Äúthere‚Äôs confusion‚Äù with @MarkLazerus reporting the SOG total at 39-21 Hawks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And 45% of the #Blackhawks goals, so far in this young season, have been scored in the first period. @madkenney @Tramyers_NHL @MarkLazerus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NHLBlackhawks have now scored first in 80% of their games!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why don‚Äôt the @Cubs consider hiring #HOF @RyneSandberg as the team‚Äôs next hitting coach?  Ryne always had a great approach at the plate, is incredibly diligent and is a beloved part of the organization. @GDubCub @MDGonzales @DavidHaugh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Tramyers_NHL Seems like the flu has been going around recently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unsurprisingly, @88PKane is at the top in team points three games into the new season but, surprisingly, he‚Äôs also at the top in team penalty minutes! What a sniper!

<|startoftext|>Why not consider MM warming up in the bullpen instead of KH considering MM only pitched 2.1 innings his last start three days ago? @GDubCub @MDGonzales @DavidHaugh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Could one more of those gifts be in the form of a Cubs‚Äô player crossing home plate?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2 observations:  (1) Lou Pinella‚Äôs first ejection as @Cubs manager  back in June 2007, was by tonight‚Äôs 1st base umpire, Mark Wegner. (2) Would be a sour ending to the season if former #Cubs closer WD saves the game tonight. @GDubCub @MDGonzales<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Cubs @benzobrist18 Something went ‚ÄúWong‚Äù on that play!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDGonzales It‚Äôs the ‚Äúplayoffs‚Äù, @CubsJoeMadd, why is HE pitching?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madkenney Stock photo.  :). Sure do miss NH as part of the BH‚Äôs D!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GDubCub Well, hey, that‚Äôs because we would‚Äôve needed him to pitch in the 8th inning in lieu of CEJ.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GDubCub So, then, does this mean that CEJ won‚Äôt be called upon?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GDubCub, given the spate of injuries, wouldn‚Äôt it maybe be best to let @KrisBryant_23 sit and rest until the playoffs start?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madkenney Need him, yes. But the process is going to be gradual and methodical coming off a concussion or concussion-like symptoms because bringing him in too soon to face high, hard SOG, physical player contact and the grind of a 60 minute game would be a mistake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madkenney Progress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GDubCub If the Cubs would only take care of business, we wouldn‚Äôt have to be scoreboard watching.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDGonzales Like I said in a different reply yesterday, maybe someone can find a tree struck by lighting and make a few bats a la Roy Hobbs (‚ÄúThe Natural‚Äù üé•) to spark the @Cubs offense!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tramyers_NHL I‚Äôd put the odds at 99%.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tramyers_NHL Any high shots?  Snap or slap shots?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GDubCub  https://t.co/8VG0H2TrQj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus And, hey, despite being -2 on the night, young Boqvist played a third of the game and had the second most points among d-men.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I should say other than phenomenal D by JB...yet again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tramyers_NHL Believe me, Tracey, you‚Äôre missing absolutely NOTHING in the Cubs game tonight...and that was with or sans KB!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh if we, fans, only had an audio link to hear what‚Äôs being chirped inside the press box right now at Wrigley Field. @GDubCub @MDGonzales @Cubs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madkenney Help!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDGonzales For precautionary reasons after getting HBP?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madkenney Wish the @Cubs had this kind of offense versus the @Pirates!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madkenney He will mean revert...thankfully.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe Kahun wearing the late Bob Probert‚Äôs number 24 on his sweater is giving him that extra ‚Äúpunch‚Äù boosting his odds of making the opening night roster? @NHLBlackhawks @Tramyers_NHL @madkenney @SatchelPrice @MarkLazerus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Hoping that past performance is indicative of future returns, Cam Ward, during his 13 year NHL career, has a .909 save %.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GDubCub Maybe someone can find a tree struck by lighting and make a few bats a la Roy Hobbs (‚ÄúThe Natural‚Äù üé•) to spark the @Cubs offense!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Well, then, how did that logic not play out when @88PKane and  @9Artemi were on the same line?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Riddle me this:  what is the good in playing vets Keith and Seabs on the same line...even if it is just in practice...instead of pairing with the younger/rookie guys?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madkenney Baby steps continue. Certainly, taking real SOG will be the true test, whenever that may come.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@smsportsguy @GDubCub @CubsJoeMadd @Cubs @MDGonzales @670TheScore It‚Äôs the collective group of players, not the manager.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smsportsguy @GDubCub @CubsJoeMadd @Cubs @MDGonzales @670TheScore ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs doing it very well.‚Äù  That‚Äôs debatable and subject to many different interpretations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smsportsguy @GDubCub @CubsJoeMadd @Cubs @MDGonzales @670TheScore If you‚Äôre implying that I am a bandwagon fan, you‚Äôre mistaken.  I‚Äôm just making an observation.  While a different sport, in the #NHL, if a non-core player scores a GWG, there‚Äôs practically a zero chance said player sits as a healthy scratch the next game.  That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But if he hit another HR tomorrow, it would be more impressive because when he did it in 2016, he DNP for a long stretch (July 11-16) before returning to the lineup to hit his third HR in three consecutive games played.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which was the only time in his regular season career.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And, for those wondering, yes, he has hit HR in three consecutive games:  July 2016.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Until now, the last time #DanielMurphy hit HR in consecutive regular season games was September 4-5, 2017. @Cubs @GDubCub @MDGonzales @670TheScore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I repeat. üò¨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this the new rule of thumb, @CubsJoeMadd:  #DavidBote hits a(nother) walk-off but doesn‚Äôt get to start the next game? @Cubs @GDubCub @MDGonzales @670TheScore #WTF #Cubs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really nice to see #DanielMurphy hit a HR for us as opposed to against us! @Cubs @GDubCub @MDGonzales @670TheScore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Make that an (adjusted) average of 6.8 IP in 5 starts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Compare and contrast: @ColeHamels, at a cost of about $4mm, has averaged 6.5 IP so far in his first five starts as a @Cubs. For $37.5mm, #YuDarvish and @TylerChatwood have averaged 4.9 IP combined in 28 starts. @MDGonzales @GDubCub @670TheScore @DavidHaugh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Kevbo_ , strange question but I was just wondering:  was the intro music to the ‚Äúold‚Äù #MullyandHanleyShow part of a real song or just synthetically created?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it just me, or does it seem more often than not when we need the @Cubs bullpen to hold down a late-inning lead, it becomes a nail-biter? @GDubCub @MDGonzales @670TheScore @MLB #Cubs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Significant changes this week on @670TheScore.  First, @DavidHaugh replaces #MikeHanley. Now, @tunein has removed #670TheScore.  This stinks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cubs killer, @Nationals #DanielMurphy, with a single-game career high 6 RBI tonight (game still in play). Several times he‚Äôs batted in 5 in a game...most recently April 25, 2017. @MLB #MLB @GDubCub @MDGonzales @670TheScore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cubs And retakes the NL RBI lead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidHaugh @mullyhaugh @670TheScore Disappointed in the change, too, but certainly won‚Äôt switch to @ESPN1000!  I‚Äôm hopeful that, while the legend #BrianHanley will be sorely missed, #670TheScore doesn‚Äôt make any further ‚Äúmodifications‚Äù to their on-air talent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, those who voted on TC going to the bullpen were correct.  https://t.co/D3GWNvjdtf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus And...shoddy defense, an underperforming power play, silly penalties, etc.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Now that the @Cubs have acquired @ColeHamels, if and when #YuDarvish returns, what becomes of the #Cubs starting rotation this season? @GDubCub @MDGonzales @Kevbo_ @chicagotribune<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tyler Chatwood didn‚Äôt allow a first inning walk for the first time since his June 30th start. @Cubs @GDubCub @MDGonzales<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@javy23baez runs pretty darn fast, but how much faster would he run if he didn‚Äôt have two tons of chains hanging from his neck?  @Cubs @GDubCub @MDGonzales @MLB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NHLBlackhawks And maybe, if needed, he can throw a couple innings of relief pitching.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MDGonzales #Problematic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While it seems like more, according to @TeamRankings, the @Cubs have allowed an average of .56 first inning runs per game this season. Last year, the same statistic was .67.  @GDubCub @MDGonzales @DavidHaugh @Kevbo_<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Here‚Äôs a solution to the @Cubs taxing bullpen situation:  get blown out and use position players to relief pitch!  @GDubCub @MDGonzales @Tramyers_NHL @MLB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The @Cubs pitching staff, through last night‚Äôs game, has surrendered 97 HR this year -(ranking 25th of 30 @MLB teams). Extrapolating their current two-HR pace per game equates to 233 HR or a substantial 20% increase versus last season. @GDubCub @MDGonzales<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not to state the obvious but, so far the second half of the season, the @Cubs starting pitching has continued to be problematic. @GDubCub @MDGonzales #Cubs #StartingPitchingIssues<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Reality on the left and two @WhiteHouse clocks?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>One last thing:  the SJS have been on the other side of a lopsided score when they defeated the @EdmontonOilers in the playoffs 7-0 on 4/18/17.  https://t.co/G7DZCIdrD4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And one more thing:  the most goals the SJS have allowed in a playoff game in franchise history is 9 (when they were defeated 9-2 by the @NHLFlames on 5/11/95).  https://t.co/WlrBNk5Jiq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turned out to be the most goals the SJS allowed in a playoff game since losing 7-3 to the @Canucks on 5/18/11.  https://t.co/LUYVcuQzwZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The last time the @SanJoseSharks surrendered &gt;= 5 goals in a POG = 5/21/16 when they lost 6-3 to the Blues. @NHL #NHL #NHLPlayoffs2018 #sanjosesharks @MarkLazerus @Tramyers_NHL<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Naturally, Marchand is/was the player involved in that play for the Bruins.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SatchelPrice Have enough pins been inserted into the 2017-18 Chicago Blackhawks voodoo doll this season or what?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus It‚Äôs 2017-18 season bad luck for the Hawks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus But of course.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SatchelPrice @MarkLazerus @aduclair10 @Tramyers_NHL He‚Äôs got just what the BH need as they rebuild:  speed, grit, youth, and plenty of upside potential.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since you @MarkLazerus @SatchelPrice are on the topic of BH player contracts, what odds do you place on the BH retaining the services of @aduclair10?  @Tramyers_NHL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus @Tramyers_NHL Yeah:  what does it take for @Tramyers_NHL to respond to a non-celebrity/non-athlete‚Äôs Tweet?  üò¨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kevbo_ What‚Äôs that all about, Kevin?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus And on that note, it‚Äôs time for the Oscars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus And to think he‚Äôs still under contract for another 6 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Something that rhymes with duck is what I said out loud after that goal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HenryInAHammock @MarkLazerus The inconsistency of this inconsistent rule is unsettling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mkovacs09 @MarkLazerus No, I‚Äôm saying if there was indeed goalie interference...why was no penalty initially called, irrespective of anything else that subsequently occurred on the play?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus So, then, why no penalty, if really interference in the first place?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus You must not have gotten outside at the right times then, Mark, as we‚Äôve had breaks in the rain with lots of golden sun.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Even though it is California, I must say that the Ice Crew at the United Center is far superior to the ‚Äúcrew‚Äù here in San Jose. @MarkLazerus @NBCSBlackhawks @NHLBlackhawks @SatchelPrice @SanJoseSharks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blackhawks loaded with minuses tonight. @SatchelPrice @NHLBlackhawks @MarkLazerus @Tramyers_NHL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus I would not want to be in the Blackhawks‚Äô locker room right now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen as many defensive ‚Äúfumbles‚Äù in a single game since watching the Bears play this season. @SatchelPrice @NHLBlackhawks @NBCSBlackhawks @MarkLazerus @Tramyers_NHL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The wifi @SanJoseSharks , in the heart of Silicon Valley, is not so great. @SatchelPrice @NHLBlackhawks @MarkLazerus @NBCSBlackhawks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kevbo_ Now that‚Äôs a statement you‚Äôd never hear on the Score!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Losing your touch @MarkLazerus?Blackhawks recall Highmore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Not that it matters at this point, but I wonder if the Hawks pretty much knew they‚Äôd be dealing Hartman, so this could have also been a factor in his benching last game?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus And that‚Äôs what your recently posted article alluded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Tough angle, tougher goal to surrender.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Indeed it was a bad penalty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Wanna put some money on it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guilford1417 @elonmusk @Tesla Close, yes, but now out to drop off ‚ÄúTess‚Äù at the service center. ‚ÄúGreat‚Äù start to my weekend!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very disappointed! And now waiting up to 45 minutes for a tow to service center. @elonmusk @Tesla  https://t.co/lfgE5ZBnY1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Unlike Jurco.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suntimes_sports @MarkLazerus Lazerus, is you think the Hawks are going to trade (again) Saad, you‚Äôd be mistaken.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Massive Google construction in Mountain View. @MarkLazerus @SatchelPrice  https://t.co/dEATd9LdUG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisDeLuca @MarkLazerus I‚Äôd put a high level of confidence that the Hawks would not (again) trade Saad, despite his underperformance this season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus And the complete opposite of last game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus And about 1000x &gt; the guy at the NHL ASG!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Would nice to see DuClair back in the lineup. Two consecutive scratches if he indeed is out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SatchelPrice How does this draft pick layout look in comparison to recent years?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What do (tonight‚Äôs) @NHLBlackhawks and California (in 2017) have in common?  They both ended huge droughts! @MarkLazerus @2ndCityHockey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NHLBlackhawks Really wasn‚Äôt much of a scrap.  I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what @johnondrasik had in mind with his group.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This game sure is exciting, but practically every commercial @WGNTV is an absolute downer (stroke or diabetes)! @NHLBlackhawks @MarkLazerus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus 7 goals combined in their last 5 games prior to tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Wow!  Spectacular move(s)!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Mean reversion is the theory suggesting that prices and returns eventually move back toward the mean or average. @Investopedia It also representative when both DK and BS score a goal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Useless Jurco finally scratched.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus @hockey_ref So you‚Äôre saying there‚Äôs a chance!  https://t.co/hpof8krAlX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Lots of dog goals scored by opponents lately on Hawks‚Äô goalies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Lots of dog goals scored by opponents lately on Hawks‚Äô goalies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus When I went to their first Friday home game against the Red Wings, at least half the crowd was rooting for Detroit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Duclair our?!  What‚Äôs the story there?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stevekonroyd Steve, will you be doing play-by-play with Pat Foley in San Jose on March 1?  Hoping I have the chance to meet you in person again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Horrible goal!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus BFD. You make it sound like he‚Äôs going to be the savior to the Hawks‚Äô season. The fact of the matter is that had some key vets played to their potential (Toews, Saad, Keith, Anisimov, for example) and the PP wasn‚Äôt atrocious, Cro‚Äôs every move wouldn‚Äôt be discussed on the daily.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Is he giving you the stare down?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus This game is about as boring as watching paint dry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus I was excited when the Hawks re-acquired BS in the trade for AP. But, like most of us, I‚Äôm completely shocked at how lost he, and his former first-line partner, JT look.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Epitome of the Hawks‚Äô PP all season!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suntimes_sports @MarkLazerus Maybe the BH should try to reverse the CM/NH trade they did with Arizona.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miracle!  Toews with a goal! @SatchelPrice @MarkLazerus @Tramyers_NHL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great analysis. @SatchelPrice @MarkLazerus @NHLBlackhawks   https://t.co/fOqtI50bIv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Until he (Crawford) plays in practice or plays in a game?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Never this much controversy in NHL games.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Stick to analyzing the Blackhawks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NHL's highest-paid player for the second straight season with only 2pts in his last 10 games, Toews really needs to step up the pace if we have any shot at the playoffs. @MarkLazerus @Tramyers_NHL @2ndCityHockey @NBCSBlackhawks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There were 3 moves combined this week of &gt;+1% (1) and &gt;-1% (2) on the S&amp;P 500. We had a total of just 8 moves of &gt;+1% and &gt;-1% for all of last year. Interestingly, in 2017, we also had 3 such moves in just one week (Aug 10, 14 &amp; 17) of &gt;+1% (1) and &gt;-1% (2). @MarkLazerus<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FitzyGSN Ouch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus You must be üö¨ something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Unnecessarily bad penalty by Jurco results in this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Yes, Toews has slowed the last couple seasons. But what else has ‚Äúslowed‚Äù?  @VZWNow  https://t.co/twGdPR82mJ Rocking @TMobile<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love when a network @NBCSN airs our National Anthem and love it even more when we get to hear him @Anthem_Singer sing both Canadian &amp; American Anthems!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Sure. ‚ÄúMakes sense‚Äù. And Jurco was really ‚Äúvalue-add‚Äù the other night, so ‚Äúglad‚Äù to see him crack the lineup again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Nice choice of numbers on his sweater.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Saving grace:  we won 3 Cups in the Toews/Kane era. Now while I‚Äôm unsatisfied with their current play, I‚Äôm quite overjoyed that I was able to see them hoist the Cup thrice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Like I said earlier today, this line shuffle is really doing wonders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus What does this 47 mean?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus The lineup shuffle continues. Why not really go crazy playing Toews on the fourth line?!  Boy would that send the team a message!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Uh, Jurco. Duh!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tramyers_NHL Hayden for Jurco swap<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goicehogs Hayden for Jurco swap<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SatchelPrice Look, just as in the case with Seabs and Sharp and Toews and other well-seasoned Blackhawks ‚Äî excluding the immortal Patrick Kane, even Keith‚Äôs overall performance was destined to decline as age and wear and tear on the body comes full circle.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus I care!  I like the insight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Ouch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Well, that explains it (why Panik was out tonight after scoring a goal last night)!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus So, scratching my head here...Panik scores a goal last night, but‚Äôs scratched today?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Ever?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus I guess the Hawks are ‚ÄúSharp‚Äù tonight, so no need to ‚ÄúPanik‚Äù.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus I don‚Äôt have a problem with this. It‚Äôs a team game and if you‚Äôre not playing up to par then, yes, you should be sitting in the pressbox. Those who have not noticed the decline in Seabrook‚Äôs play are naive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stevekonroyd  May be a bit early to ask, but are you going to be in San Jose to broadcast with Foley on March 1st?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Don‚Äôt like that move. What‚Äôs the logic behind that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Dude, you‚Äôre seconds ahead of my DTV feed. Annoying!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Meow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Well, that certainly would be one way to rapidly increase your frequent flier miles with UAL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Q does more lineup juggling than a Cirque du Soleil juggling artist. It‚Äôs very Joe Maddon-like and I‚Äôm not a fan. Tough to get consistency when your linemates change on the daily. I think that‚Äôs a factor in the Blackhawks overall streaky, inconsistency this season to date.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@elonmusk Are there any plans in the near future to show SC availability in the Tesla app in similar fashion to the navigation screen inside the vehicle?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Unacceptable to surrender a two-goal lead with a couple minutes remaining in regulation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Mean reversion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus ‚ÄúWonderful‚Äù, but not surprising given Q‚Äôs post-game comments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Still don‚Äôt understand why the NHL hasn‚Äôt been able to eradicate illegal hits (from behind). They were able to get rid of bench-clearing brawls using heavy fines and suspensions. Maybe they should do the same with illegal hits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Your tweets are about 5 seconds ahead of my DTV feed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Simply stated, it‚Äôs called regression. Third worst PP% in the NHL is absolutely atrocious and unacceptable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Yes, indeed, a miracle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus 1. Seabs should not be playing on the PP.  2. I‚Äôd load the boat with forwards (Toews, Saad, Kane and AD) and play Keith as the lone D-man.  3. I‚Äôd put Saad right in front of the net.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Hawks‚Äô PK has been less than stellar lately and, while night and day in comparison to last season, the recent downward trend has been concerning. Adding more fuel to the fire is the fact that the team‚Äôs PP production has been virtually nonexistent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus That‚Äôs how PF called it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLazerus Need to get that first line going!  Certainly the trade bringing back Saad, to spark Toews, hasn‚Äôt brought the consistent play back to Toews‚Äô game.<|endoftext|>
