<|startoftext|>Just last month, a Saudi strike in northern Yemen killed 31 civilians, 19 of them children, and injured another 18 kids. "It was an attack on a civilian-populated area where children were in the vicinity," UNICEF reported, which is to say, a tragedy that could have been avoided<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The U.S.-backed coalition has also hit hospitals, funerals, weddings, schools, markets, refugee camps, and residential neighborhoods, and it has continued to do so since the bus strike caused global outrage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vital infrastructure isn't all the Saudi-led intervention has destroyed: The coalition's airstrikes have a high rate of civilian casualties. The attack on a school bus that killed 40 children in 2018 was merely the most infamous of its genre.<|endoftext|>
