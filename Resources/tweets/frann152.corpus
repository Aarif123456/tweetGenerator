<|startoftext|>@SmallGovDude @MisterSkipworth @paulr140 @knomia @BilancieriNews Joe Biden is the President Elect of the United States. Not just the Red/Republican States.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulr140 @SmallGovDude @knomia @BilancieriNews Don't call me a liar. This is exactly what #tRump supporters do and why people feel the way they do. You're a liar and you're brainwashed and this will be the last tweet you get from me. #ByePaul<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulr140 @Harry1T6 Right,,,The travel ban from China was put into place before it was named a Pandemic in America and restrictions were put in place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulr140 @SmallGovDude @knomia @BilancieriNews So why are people who stood by now abd stood down now beating Americans who believe what they believe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulr140 @Harry1T6 March 2020,,,was before the PANDEMIC. We were not told masks were necessary in March 2020.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulr140 @SmallGovDude @knomia @BilancieriNews And,,,that is not what #tRump said. He did not include law enforcement in his comment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulr140 @Harry1T6 Can you tweet this comment from Dr Fauci? I never heard or saw it,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulr140 @SmallGovDude @knomia @BilancieriNews He said "Stand Down and Stand By". If he would have won, there wouldn't be any violence. He lost and people are being beaten because they did not vote for him. He even started to kill black people on Death Row because he is mad at Blacks for not supporting him. Go figure,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Harry1T6 @paulr140 This was tweeted on February 20, 2020 before we really knew how dangerous the Coronavirus was. #tRump downplayed the  information because he didn't want to create a panic in America.  Remember #tRump said it was Airborne and extremely dangerous,,,,,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SmallGovDude I still vote because my vote could be the difference a between win or a loss. I know who I want to win,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One thing is, they won't come to "HOOD" with this 🐂💩.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SmallGovDude @knomia @BilancieriNews No it's not. This is @realDonaldTrumps America. #JoeBiden is President Elect. #Trump is president and he is the one inciting violence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennteel09 @BilancieriNews A pack of fools who don't even know who/what they are fighting for. What has #tRump done for them? They sure aren't getting any stimulus help. #tRump is gonna take their money and leave. That's all he wants is money. He will never get elected President of the USA again,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthRae @BayleePearls @BilancieriNews They are beating people with sticks and punching them for no reason. These people are not inciting violence. This needs to STOP. The real question is "what has @realDonaldTrump done for them"? Do they have jobs? Can they feed their families? Why are they beating people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You are absolutely correct. When is Law going to step up and do something. This is all on @realDonaldTrump and will follow his "legacy" forever. Now we need the Military to step up and save America ‼<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It appears DJT is upset African Americans and Black women because they didn't vote for him. One beat him in a "LANDSLIDE" election and an African American Woman is coming for his ass in the #SDNY. Now he is electrocuting black men and a woman bc he is mad. This is sick,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't understand why these Republicans are afraid of @realDonaldTrump. Are they afraid he will beat them up? What can he do to them? I would never stoop to a one term impeached F-O-R-E-V-E-R president or anyone who thinks he is above the law. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If America never understood who tRump is they should know now. This rally was all about him. David Purdue and Kelly Loffler are toast. Nothing here is helping and these dumb people believe him. He is helping decide not to vote with these videos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan Yes,,,it showed on his face and he did not like it,,,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thekjohnston Where is she getting this information from. Rudy can't even control her. How does she even know dead people voted. This is absurd and this is why tRump is still losing, losing, losing.Yes she would do excellent in comedy as a drunk person spewing misinformation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He only cares about the election he lost and taking peoples money to support himself. The money is not going where they think, it's going in his pocket. His supporters have been tricked. Stop sending your last $5.00 to this monster. You might need it lone day,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't understand how tRump supporters believe him. He is stealing their money, he dosen't care  that Americans are dying and rising at a high rate and he is not doing anything to help people caught in this Pandemic. "HE DOSEN'T CARE ABOUT Y'ALL".....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You're still lying. You don't care about Americans. What about the 266,887 people who died from your negligence of COVID-19. 80,000,OOO people liked Joe Biden more than you. You put America last to win this election and you lost by a lot.

<|startoftext|>@jsolomonReports @realDonaldTrump So what if they do. tRump constantly bragged about how many lawyers he appointed the rush to appoint a new SCOTUS.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump No other Country has been clobbered like America, your Country, by COVID-19. Remember this happened on your watch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pablo_honey1 @IvankaTrump This is one of the reasons you were #FIRED. January 20  2022 will be a beautiful day in the neighborhood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VicStoddard @IvankaTrump This is what @realDonaldTrump has turned America into...SAD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bssweeper @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump Yep he got it done alright. He got 11M+ Americans infected and 246K+ Americans  are dead because he wanted to down play COVID-19. He turned his back on Scientist and now he wants to claim he got the vaccine done. #TrumpIsFired<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Oh please,,,you were playing golf,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JakeSherman @abbydphillip @SavannahGuthrie Yes @abbydphillip. You shine on CNN and you deserve it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Right,,,they act like they don't understand. We need to make this go Viral ‼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnaCabrera This is SAD what a sitting president is doing to his country. There is something wrong Mentally and he needs help<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cedfunches Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought Donald Trump was putting America first. With 246,129 deaths and 11,029,470 COVID-19 cases and no relief America does not appear to be put first. He is playing golf and begging for money from the less fortunate people. Trump lied to his base.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It takes a dope to know a dope and you hired him,,,It is what is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The election is over and we have a new President and Vice President Elect. It is time to ignore the childish antics of #45 and focus on #46. On January 20, 2021 #45 will be irrelevant at 12pm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DocTucson Absolutely,,,he just wants to be seen to remain relevant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂😂😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @RudyGiuliani @MariaBartiromo Giuliani is a hoax and with all the so called hoaxes he's claimed, not one has been proven to be true. His time is up too,,, #GETOUTNOW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr At this point the World sees what the tRumps are doing. No tRump will ever occupy the WH or any political position again. Your legacy is doomed bc of #45s actions and especially the PANDEMIC. Over 245K deaths an close to 11M infected. No matter what you say,,,ITS OVER. Goodbye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Delusional, Delusional, Delusional and pathetic. The one term germ is having a temper tantrum. Relax, its over. Thanks for keeping us us informed on your attempted coup. You were out smarted this time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan @realDonaldTrump Hey Gym,,, Democrats oppose you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Mr tRump,,,the RIGGED ELECTION was overturned. You lost the first count and you lost the second count. 306 to 232. 7.7M to 7.2M,,,A #BlueLandslide has occurred. Even if you read the numbers backwards you still lose. Democrats kicked your a** with more to come,,,GA Senate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly,,,they finished the Kentucky rather quickly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a cute video. Please excuse the video caption language  https://t.co/b0icxZQCuK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You got your "As* kicked". Remember you won by a landslide 306 Electoral votes and the unpopular vote you lost by 3M+. Well Biden won by a landslide,,,306 Electoral votes and a 5M+ popular vote. Shame on you for continuing to hos superspreading fundraisers bc you're BROKE. 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nogg_the @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @LouDobbs It's just like the binder on tRumps medical plan she handed NBC with no plan in it. She is really making tRump look worse than ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @ChanelRion @OANN Why is it that only you, OANN and FoxNews have these stats. Where did they come from? #GoodByedOnaldtRump. America will not miss you,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnCornyn Well sir you should be ashamed for making the country go through this. You know darn all votes were legal. How can you appease a loser over the Country you took an oath to serve. Yep,,,shame on you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @LouDobbs 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂 You don't really believe that 💩 do you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @LouDobbs What's the matter Donnie,,,you mad? This will not be the last time you lose. #SDNYComing #PresidentElectBiden and #VicePresidentElectHarris will move into the White House on January 20, 2021. You're fired at noon on the same day......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews BRW,,,You are the Orange Goose,,,not Golden. 🍊🍊🍊🍊 baby 🍊🍊🍊🍊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @FoxNews can't continue to spread lies when the evidence is written in front of their faces. You should listen to @CNN. That's good truthful news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump God, Fox News, Thanksgiving,  Christmas, The Projects, Schools, Churches, The Suburbs etc. and all aspect of The Media, print or TV  was here before you and will remain in tact zaz qafter January 20, 2021. You're "FIRED AT 12PM on Inauguration Day #LOSER<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ProjectLincoln Not to me. We want a new Administration<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Schnitzel_Dog @LabyrinthWeaver @ProjectLincoln 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😁😁😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How does @realDonaldTrump expect to run for President again in 2024 if he is treating the transition of President Elect Biden so disrespectful. America will never reelect him or elect any member of the tRump crime family again. He was already "Impeached "for holding things up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What did you win? Isn't 77M+ more than 72M+. Now I see why you llike uneducated people,,,because you're uneducated too if you think your math is correct. We already have a "A WINNER" #BYEDON<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great News!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@M7ate9 @MysterySolvent Rank<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sddphoto This ish is very scarey and dangerous. What is tRump doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cristofaro_jose @DonaldJTrumpJr They want their base to drink Lemonade instead of Koolaid 😁😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is happening with #45 and the COVID-19? With the cases and deaths going up, is @realDonaldTrump ordering new supplies, i.e. gowns, masks, gloves, Ventilators,, ,or is he just thinking about himself? We need a President who cares about the US and who respects our country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smaltzExTrumper @mmpadellan Cement,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr tRump won Texas right? Can't you get arrested for soliciting liars to buy lies about the American Election process? I suggest Lie Detector test for each liar you recruit. It's a felony offense to lie to the FBI. Be care Jr., you're gonna get more time peddling this 💩💩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr @nypost Hey Jr. If I were paid $130,000 I might lie too. Is it true you paid him to lie? For once in your life tell the truth. Sounds like payment to Stormy Daniels<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh,,,that "P" word,,, #LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glamelegance @realDonaldTrump Impeached One Term Germ.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You were suppose to put your hand over your heart, not try and hold your hair up in the rain with that fake salute. You really are embarrassing America.......Sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump This sounds like you knew you would lose so you planted a conspiracy theory for your base. Is this the beginning of a planned coup? America does not need or want a President who will not accept the truth about a Pandemic, his reelection or help his Country<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn't @realDonaldTrump doing to Biden what he claimed Biden did to the Ukraine. Holding up funds?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@judgeyourself99 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Maybe a prison library. He might learn to read while sitting there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyOstroy @realDonaldTrump We don't need anymore superspreading rallies in America. The last weeks total cases were the highest we've seen since the beginning of COVID-19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You know #45 not everyone like you. You can't make people like you or what you stand for. James Comey and Andrew McCabe did their job and they chose not to be loyal to you. You can't blame them for rightfully doing their job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dvillella @kelorie1 @jbsgreenberg @KevinMKruse @KlasfeldReports I totally agree with you. Trump cannot catch up in the Electoral college to win. Pennsylvania is all #Biden need.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I thought he lost the case in Michigan. They will just add this one to the other 10 cases you already lost if you didn't lose it already<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@faerwalker @DonaldJTrumpJr Do you know what investigating, interrogation or asking legal questions mean? Not intimidating Jr. Just questions. BTW he broke down and told the truth,,,,though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the Republicans are so sure this election fraudulent, then how did the Republican Senators and Congressmen get reelected? There would be fraud throughout the vote. How did Lindsey and McConnell get reelected again. They are the worst 2 Senators in the GOP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump correction,,,You know he is lying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandPaul You need to be examined for the 💩 that comes out of your mouth. It amazes me to see how you grown] educated men are afraid of @realDonaldTrump. What does he have on you. You knowing is lying. Why are you protecting him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ASparklyWTF @fras99 @BudGothmog44 😂😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fras99 FLOTUS started to build a Tennis Court,,,what happened to it? How much money did it cost American Taxpayers?  Who is Be Best<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You should know. The election is over and you're still trying to suppress the vote and solicit financial gain. Stop it now and just go away,,,PLEASE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Acyn Didn't @realDonaldTrump promote to America that absentee ballots were better than mail in ballots? Are you upset that Democrats listened to #45 for once. We requested ballots, mailed in the ballots, won the election and now you want to somehow eliminate mail in voting? 🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OliviaArbuckle @the_resistor @BreitbartNews @realDonaldTrump A Black tRump head would look very nice on an orange shirt, mask, hat etc. I would buy one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreitbartNews @realDonaldTrump This is so dumb. Who is paying this num nut? Taxpayers?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marklevinshow No one is more obvious reading from a teleprompter than #45. We all may need this vaccine someday, including you sir. Science is the way to go. It is what it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump When the counting is over you will lose. Remember we told you so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The map that really shows how  @realDonaldTrump lost the election is the red map of the country showing active Coronavirus cases. 10,110,552M positive cases and 238K deaths. That's the losing map as opposed to the Electoral map.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You can't say that. You're not a Legal Scholar nor a genius. Pennsylvania wants to  count all votes. This system worked for you in 2016, why not now can't it work for #BidenHarris<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngelaBelcamino @realDonaldTrump 🤚🏽🤚🏽🤚🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Are you afraid of Andrew McCabe returning to the White House? You fired him 2 years or so ago. Why are you attacking him now? I hope he comes back to get justice on you. We are fighting for justice to make you a absentee ballot from the White House. 😂😂😁😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump what is happening on the North Lawn at the White House. First you tried to build a Tennis Court, then you made the Rose Garden look like a Cemetery and now the North lawn is gone. What are you doing,,, having a TANTRUM????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump How? You don't have enough Electorial Votes. Remember those votes you bragged about in 2016? You need to stop using people for your fundraising antics. You lost. It's over. #GoodByeDonaldTrump. #PresidentBiden and #VPHarris will occupy the WH. The People have voted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Only based on you, @realDonaldTrump and your cronies. You guys have made a joke of the republican party<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump No credit to you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @newtgingrich NOT. You are embarrassing yourself more than trying to embarrass someone by firing people on Twitter. No one is going to want to work with you again once you leave our house on your way to the big house....Sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Biden out ran Obama in these states because America wanted to get rid of you. We are tired of you and your bs. Stop!!! It is over. Don't hurt America because you're upset you lost. Like Putin said, you should leave with dignity,,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Great news, but you still lose. #BYEDON<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Xtinaresists @DonaldJTrumpJr 😂😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Not one person was killed by a police officer with his knee in their neck. Are you trying to run for President or any office? You're a tRump you're "fired"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany The answer is there were Republicans, Democrats and Cameras watching "ding bat".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr So youre admitting defeat on Twitter but you tell your @realDonaldTrump to continue fighting. Something is wrong with this picture/family. #TRUMPISFIRED<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Why didn't you notice there was voter fraud In 2016. Oh, i forgot, Russia was helping you. #YOUREFIRED45  #PresidentElectJoeBiden and #VicePresidentElectKamalaHarris<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MerrillLynched @realDonaldTrump I wonder if the rise in COVID-19 is related to the superspreading rallies @realDonaldTrump was hosting in these different states,,,these numbers of cases are astronomical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani Yeah Rudy like you proved Hunter Biden was crooked. Where is the proof, in the Hunter Biden laptop? You're making your client and his family look like fools. It's over. Plus whose paying you. Taxpayers? Give it up already. Tired of seeing you and this bs everyday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dvillella @realDonaldTrump If you're correct, check the voting machines Ivanka got exempt patents for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Since the beginning,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow You promoted absentee ballots. You sabotaged the post office with Dejoy. You told your base to vote at the polls. Democrats used staying safe method and they voted by mail. Now you're complaining? You're Fired, Fired Mr tRump. Get over it. It is what it is dude.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chuck_Numenor @realDonaldTrump Not deleting this. When you tweet it, live by it. He could tweeted this 20 years ago. He must be able to lose with dignity. IT IS WHAT IT IS!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr You just mad that Russia was being closely being watched for voter fraud and could not help  @realDonaldTrump steal the the election for the second time. Its over Jr. Now we can watch @realDonaldTrump being prosecuted and sent off to jail. 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😁😁😁<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jsolomonReports @realDonaldTrump I thought @realDonaldTrump didn't like Whistleblowers. He fired Col. Vindman for thinking he was a whistleblower right. Start acting like the Biggest Loser 🤡🤡🤡 and pack your bags and leave. The white House needs fumigating!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BuckSexton @realDonaldTrump Weren't there cameras in these places. Check the cameras/tapes. Why is it ok for the tRump administration to go to court and not the Democrats? Grow up guys and accept LEGAL defeat. You're acting like a bunch of 🤡🤡🤡🤡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan Hey Gym Jordan, tell this ish to the Judge.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @EveningEdit How the hell do you think they are running up? People are counting.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You are the only one saying they got it wrong. In the future, never tell your base not to mail in votes. Democrats are susceptible to getting COVID-19 and we did not want to stand on line to vote. We requested absentee ballots, mail them in and we are winning winning winning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Yep and we don't need another Country to help us WIN. We are WINNING, WINNING, WINNING. "YOU'RE FIRED"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DevinCow STHU. President Biden is a fighter too. He is patient and he is kind  to the American people. He dosen't call people names just because they don't like him. Go get some sleep Jr. What keeps you up and going for 3 days. We already know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay,,,its looking like the "BLUEWAVE" has hit the White house. Thank God. No redwave,,,there is no such thing as a redwave today. We're nearing 306 Electoral Votes. Yes....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zoobadger @batemanjason @ShoppingDiva812 So am I<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is so sad when a man cannot accept defeat. Its because of the action taken during his reign. It's almost over. So much for winning, winning, winning. I've never seen a man in the news every day for 3yrs &amp; 10 months. Reality has finally set in. #BidenHarris #ByeDonnie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump Trust me they are all legal.

<|startoftext|>@markknoller 🤣🤣🤣🤣 How does he know which are legal and which ones are illegal? @realDonaldTrump must realize that there is nothing illegal about how the States are using their rights to count. Time for tRump to accept defeat, and shut up. It is what it is.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EricTrump First of all, who is recording this video @EricTrump. Are you telling me you guys had people recording while ballots were being recorded.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Your lawyers didn't ask for help "meaningful access" when you were getting help in 2016. What happened. No one wants your goons watching them dressed in  full military armor carrying guns. Its intimidating. Take a NAP. It should all be over in the morning hopefully. #BYEDON<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews Oh please @realDonaldTrump. He is not leaving and he will be reelected for his handling of the Election and this is not my state. tRump needs to leave to avoid being embarrassed and laughed at in "Entire World".<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Nomie1971 @realDonaldTrump He is looking for an excuse to use the Supreme Court to his advantage. You know, I know and the whole world knows @realDonaldTrump is lying. He did not win and he will not win. President Bidens inauguration January 20, 2021.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Losing in Michigan big time,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump After telling America to vote absentee, and 9M did, you're now telling us we should have voted a month ago. You know we can't count all the votes on November 3rd. What are you afraid of?]<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Did you see the polls in Wisconsin,,,you're losing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Finally the campaign is over. Now Mr Trump will you tell America what your plans for the next 4 years are. We have been patiently waiting for them. Please tell us 🤔🤔🤔<|endoftext|>

We have never in the history of America seen buildings boarded up nor have we ever seen the White House barricaded. You have to go now,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Phil_Lewis_ This man @realDonaldTrump is appalling. He is a monster an only want to protect rethuglicans. How did we ever get to this point in history. A president without an administration or any farm sense,,,SAD<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ericcervini I hope the Biden supporters or anyone on the highway at the time of this bull💩 got plate numbers of these monsters. If I were a Trumpster I would definitely vote Democrat after seeing this mess. These people are monsters and someone could have been hurt or even killed 😡😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump If Sleepy Joe Biden win, we will very quickly lose YOU #PresidentJoeBidenJr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Make this go viral!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>this could turn into murder by vehicles/people who support you. We do not need a president who believes that killing people to get reelected is ok. No one asked for protection. The last person who called himself protecting property is 17 yrs old, in jail with 2 bodies on him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump it is appalling to see your cronies running people off the road and slowing down the #BidenHarris bus. You are not only killing people with your COVID-19 superspreading rallies now your cronies are tryin to cause accidents on the highway,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngelEyes9033 @realDonaldTrump Because it was fake news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Aren't you currently losing in Michigan? Thank you<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump SDNY is going to make you  a prisoner but at least you'll be safe unless your cellmate has COVID-19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So why was this the only rally that lasted 10 to 13 minutes. You abandoned the people of Minnesota. They wanted cheer and you left them hanging. Shame on you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@okkie48 @realDonaldTrump Well it didn't disappear and on  January 20, 2021 you will leave the White House for good and disappear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You are delusional. The Surburbs has not changed and no projects can be built on their private properties. Just like Thanksgiving, Christmas, 4th of July and any other holiday will not disappear off the calendar. You are the only one that will leave when your rein is up.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thank you,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @OANN Maybe if you told America what your plans are for the next 4 years we would halfway believe you. You lied on Biden so much that people like him more than they like you. Thanks for giving #BidenHarris so much attention. We love them even more now because you lied on them !!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Show up and vote in this #BlueLandslide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What happened at your rally in Rochester, Minnesota. It was only 12 minutes long. Why did you leave so soon?😁😁😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You know you are telling on yourself. If Biden was as corrupt as you say he would have never been able to serve as VP for 8 long years. His record is clean unlike yours. You destroyed our democracy and your plan is to do it again, even harsher. #BidenHarris2020  #ByeDon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewYang @realDonaldTrump is not going to approve a stimulus package until after the election. This was his and McConnells plan all along. That's why McConnell has not been at the white House for months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump ,,,correction,,,from voting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Make this go viral,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What have you done for the people you want to vote for you? NOTHING!!! I knew you were going to wait until after the election to say you wil give a big stimulus package. Are you still going to give a big stimulus package if you lose?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump 🤚I know, 🤚I know,,, @realDonaldTrump. Look what he did to the Post Office. Now he wants the SCOTUS to back him in stopping voters from voters. He's going to lose by a "BLUE LANDSLIDE".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump How can all the votes be counted on November 3rd? You know that's impossible. You're scared and you're losing because of your actions. No one wants a President who makes fun of a Pandemic during his run for reelection. You should #RESIGN now or you'll be embarrassed on Nov.  3rd<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You can't protect pre-existing conditions and cut Social Security if your lawyers are in the SCOTUS trying to cut it and you saying you hope they will cut it. You cannot have it both ways. You tell so many lies and that's why you're get hit with a blue Tsunami,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump These things existed before you and will continue to exist. You're the one who won't have Thanksgiving, Christmas, 4th of July, weddings or graduation because you will be sitting in jail dressed in your made in China orange suit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It's called Karma dude. There will be no tax hike for middle class Americans. Only the 1% you gave the biggest tax break to. What goes around comes right back around and bite you in the but,,, #ItIsWhatItIs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>How is it @realDonaldTrump can use Air Force One and Marine One to transport him across the country to do rallies. Isn't it illegal to use taxpayer money for his personal gain/agenda? Just  asking,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Job loss due to COVID-19,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You don't have a clue if you think the H1NI Swine Flu was the worst pandemic in the history of America. COVID-19 is the worst  Pandemic and it's worsening everyday and you tell Senior Citizens we're rounding the curve. You appear to want these people to die.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Are you talking about the "suckers and losers" the name you called Americas Heros,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump These are your final days in the Oval Office. Enjoy your last days,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Correction:  10 days before the election,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Superspreading the #tRumpVirus with all of these Seniors. You have no respect for these people most of who will get sick and not see Christmas. You can't be ugly for 3 years and 10 months then change 210 days before the election. You are who you are.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr What about Ivanka Trump,  Eric Trump, Don Trump Jr.? Aren't you corrupt too. America thinks especially since you got caught stealing from a Charity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump What is the percentage of the Black prison rate. I have seen one other Black person tRump has let out. BTW why didn't you capitalize Black, but you did it for Hispanics. It a clear indication of who you and your family are "RACIST"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump Boo boo,,,you need to change your terminology from Peace to division here in the United States. We're not Red, we're not Blue. We are United and we're looking for a leader to Unite Us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricTrump When? So your father knew this and he did nothing,,,why? He's been in charge for 4 years and nothing has changed this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AuroraPicardat @dvillella @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden #45 should shut up when his time is up. She was working on a schedule that tRump tried 25  x to override and she shut him down,,,respectfully<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar That's another non answer. Who was the country successful for? Oh, his rich friends. Its not all about the money bcuz when you leave this earth you can't take that money with you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here er go Donald. Where is it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EricTrump Hey Eric,,,it's time to stop with this bs story. How corrupt is your dad with an account in China where he paid more in taxes to China than he did to the US Federal Government.

<|startoftext|>@JustVent6 @Baligubadle1 @realDonaldTrump @USDOT Not only that, no stimulus, no unemployment checks and no mail. Trying to stop mail in voters from voting won't help him win though.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PaymanBenz Please, please, please get out and register. Trump is slowing down the mail to stop mail in voting, but we can stop him by registering to vote and turning out and win this election in a landslide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>mail are not getting their important mail which is stopping their livelihoods. No checks, no Bill's that are due and especially medication. This is absurd and we can stop #45 and his cronies including the postmaster general. Raise your hand if you're with me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is happening to the mail? Is this how @realDonaldTrump think he's going to win? Everyone with an elderly, disabled person close to them should get out and get the people to the polls. We need to show #trump that he cannot cheat to win this election.

<|startoftext|>@bmooney12341 @MSNBC Why is it everything that goes wrong is the Democrats fault. Democrats did not let 160K+ people die. What did they do to prevent this from happening?

<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump This is nothing but an illegal rally at the taxpayers expense with such a large crowd. They seem to get larger everyday.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump With you eliminating CDC from getting COVID-19 information is suppressing America from the truth about the virus.

<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump COVID-19,  COVID-19 COVID-19,,,PEOPLE ARE DYING dONALD tRUMP and all you speak about is law and order.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @ICEgov What about the people that lost their loved ones, 137,000, to COVID-19? Is this all you have to talk about law and order especially since you have broken the law at every turn and want to change it. #SDNY coming for you #RESIGNNOW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Why does tRump always have to read everything? Why can't he make a speech without reading it word for word like previous presidents. Is it because he doesn't know how to or is this admin afraid he will say the wrong thing. We need a President who understands and know what to say<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SilkAnDiamonds My facts are straight. What he did do was let putin pay terrorists to kill American Soldiers and he has turned his back on 137,000 Americans who died of COVID-19. Need I say more. Get your facts straight.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump If there is too much testing, why do you keep testing. You're using taxpayer funds to test. If you stop testing then America will stop testing. Looks like the Hydrocloriquin is affecting your eyes. I'm sure you know that it does affect the eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends You wish rethuglicans voter registration was up and voting for you.  Its up because people are voting for #JoeBiden our next President.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Here's the question #45, what happens if people don't get a test,  find out a month or so they are sick and it's too late to save their lives? Will you then take responsibility? I don't think so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump @kayleighmcenany @PressSec @kayleighmcenany you said you would not lie. What happened? Everytime you defend this ignorant president makes you look just as bad as it makes him look. STOP lying and tell tha truth<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BetsyDeVosED Safely opening schools is a great idea. What's the plan. Hmmmm, I listened to you with Dana on CNN Sunday and you couldn't or wouldn't lay out your plan.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What about the lowlifes who marched through Charlottesville, VA killing a woman. You call "your people" the terminology you use, lowifes and the Charlottesville thugs are very fine people. Can you explain how you come up with the names you call people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It just looks taller to me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump Maybe because he is violating the Constitution or breaking the law<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump No #45, are YOU going to say SOOOOO SORRY for what I've done to America?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump If people don't get tested now to!!! find out if they're infected or not,  we could have a higher death toll. Why in the world would you stop testing. Do you want people to just fall in the streets and die. This is sick. Keep testing,,,its the right thing to do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Isn't that the same wall President Obama built. All you did was change the fence which are being penetrated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump @VP You don't stand up for the children in cages. They want Education Freedom. What are you doing for the children you took from their parents and locked in cages #45?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Threatening Americans again. Is this why you bought Soldiers home so they can attack American citizens? Can't wait to see you go. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteBlue2020  #BYEDON #VOTEFORJOEBIDEN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What are the terms? To help you get elected,,,SAD,,,Once a cheater, always a cheater<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So funny how you listen to and believe everyone with the exception of your own intelligence and staff. This is why you're losing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews #45 sorry to tell you but I think you already know,,,you are the disaster of our time.  Blame yourself for not listening and thinking you could do anything you wanted to do. #NotAKing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You wanted Foreign Countries i.e. Ukraine,  China, to help you right,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan @realDonaldTrump The "Walk of Defeat",,,#BYEDON<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You should meet with Congress to discuss a peaceful exit White House. You have no power!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump They sure aren't going as a vote to you. #BYEDON<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dvillella @realDonaldTrump Looks like he was crying or wanted to with that red tie hanging and balled up maga hat 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @BretBaier You said an hour ago that 200 miles were done. Which is it 200 or 212? #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020 #VoteBlue2020 #BYEDON<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You wish you could hop down the stairs like President Obama did and still does. You are the first unpresidential and inelegant person to occupy the Oval Office in the history of our country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funder But we knew this was coming. I told my husband he's going to fire his campaign manager,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoJoFromJerz I've never seen him with his red tie undone before. Maybe he's getting the message. He looks so SAD,,,I'm Retweeting too,,, 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump That didn't happen. No 2 speeches in Tulsa, OK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What happened to the millions request for tickets and the people in the overflow area? What happened to your outside speech Tulsa.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Well it happened and America is Happy. Especially Tulsa,,,the ones who didn't show up. #RESIGNNOW.  Save yourself from the humility of being embarrassed. Tulsa was the beginning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump At least #45 you will serve government again, in jail. You can fire who you want to but there is always someone to come in and take over. A Republican Attorney who donated to your campaign and you fired him. You're always firing people. Now the people will fire you,  11/3/2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You break laws every time you open your mouth and lie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Yep,,,we will be stronger without you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Is this all the silent majority. I thought over a million people would be there. Too many empty seats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Looks like quite a few.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffsessions @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Oh please stop kissing his but.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dvillella @jeffsessions @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Exactly,,,that's what he is looking for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think tRump was practicing his "GOODBYE" speech. That was truly a disgraceful moment in Tulsa. That was in no way a campaign rally. Nobody is listening to him any more and the people behind him were paid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy Father's Day<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump where are the million people. Arena not even full. This is how the crowd will vote for you. The State is named Minneapolis not Minnineaapolis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr So what do you call your dad,,,a Loser? I say yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#45 dosen't care about people getting sick because he is not  running for reelection. He's running to stay out of prison. #SDNY is investigating him and Guiliani. That's why Barr fired the Attorney in NY. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020 #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @MayorBowser It's all your fault. You started this,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Some of these people have been out there for 1 week. That dosen't sound too sanitary. Sweat, spit, stink and no masks equals COVID-19.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Fox is not kissing up to tRump anymore and the big orange baby is crying. Fox is not running for office to keep their jobs, you are. As long as they say nice things about you it's okay. Now they're tired of your lies and you're mad. SAD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@henryrodgersdc @realDonaldTrump @gregg_re @FoxNews Dems prefer you and McAuliffe need to bunker down and stay there FOREVER<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So lame when you say you love something. You're not capable of real love,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump When you have to say "you've done more" it's an indication that you haven't done sh*t. Why do you you keep saying it. Is it to convince your brainwashed base. #RESIGNNOW #BYEDON #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020 #VoteBlue2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dvillella @Keysfins @realDonaldTrump This country is not made up of only rethuglicans and conservatives. What is wrong with you. It appears you're trying to make the country white again with slave owners. This will never happen again in America. #RacistTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You built a wall around the White House,,,but still people protesting all around the country and abroad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanScavino @realDonaldTrump You know you would change your tune too if you got fired. I'm glad he's spilling the dirt on #HumptyTrumpty. Now we hear from an insider exactly who is sitting in that Oval Office. #RESIGNNOWTRUMP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mike_Pence The God I serve would never insist that it's okay not to protect themselves during a "Pandemic". I thought you were a Jesus loving man. He is looking down on you watching and listening to everything you do and say.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So I'm guessing this is law and order.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the reason tRump wanted to refurbish the military is so they can come and police America. He is a dictator wannabe.  Now he's barricading himself in the White House. Why? He has a bunker. #45 is running scared!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zarzarevich @MsMariaT @realDonaldTrump No but we know a BOT when we see one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Yes next year will be the best because you will be gone. We don't want another 4 years of the president gassing people, beating people and shooting people with rubber bullets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dvillella @realDonaldTrump Stupid and stupider<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump No it not that he visited the church, it was his purpose for visiting the church.  A photo op and holding a Bible, that was not his, upside down. Also what he did to get there.  Gassing, shooting and beating Americans,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You tried that already and look at America,,, cops murdering a black man in broad daylight, military forces gassing and beating people so you can walk to a burned out church for a photo op. Go to your bunker and shut up. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @CNN Very bad for the country just like you are.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Go to you dam bunker and shut up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @SenatorTimScott So what happened,,,where are the jobs? 40M unemployed, Schools closed, poverty is the same as when you took office. Lowest Crime rate. People are desperate and need cash money. Approve the stimulus NOW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanadaGreat @dvillella @realDonaldTrump Looters breached a small portion of the wood boarders and went in the store. But they were immediately arrested.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dvillella @realDonaldTrump Exactly,,,#45 is a moron<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump My condolences to the family, but what about the 106,000+ COVID-19 Americans who lost their lives because you choose to ignore the crisis and play golf. Now you're gassing, shooting and torturing people so you could take a gawd dam picture with a Bible that wasn't yours. Fake Ass<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TotalToughScene @realDonaldTrump @NC_Governor You sure don't know your famous people if you think this is 50 Cent<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@boxovoteblue @QuancyClayborne Not at all. My thoughts too!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You should have dealt with COVID-19 in January.  Now because of you 106,000+ people are dead, 40M unemployed, failed economy and you sit there and bash a City that are no longer welcome to. The place has been vandalized but not ripped apart stupid<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Shut up nigel and stop eating so dam much,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Right,,,go to the bunker and be SILENT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Oh, you remember there's a pandemic. #ResignNowTrump We don't want you anymore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Liar,, why didn't you get involved with COVID-19 and act this quickly instead of playing golf? Macy's windows are not broke. There are wood panels surrounding the front. Only one small area was that was broken into. Go to your bunker and STFU,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Listen to you. New York is part of America and all you do is talk about the Governor. He would be a better President than you anyday. You're jealous because he handled COVID-19 better than you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dvillella @realDonaldTrump He looks like a fool standing there holding the Bible up side down and the world can't wait until he get out of the White House. He is dumb and ignorant and nobody wants to deal with him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You call shooting, gasing and pepper spraying  Americans defending them. This was a peaceful protest and the curfew was not in effect. You're a monster and a failure and you should stop playing with God.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AnnCoulter This is the dumbest and stupidest tweet on Twitter at a time like this. Focus on what's happening in our Country not on a "Fake" news story about something you know nothing about. Disrespectful and unbelievable that you would tweet this "bullsh*t"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In my opinion the only way to stop protesting and looting is to arrest the remaining 3 officers involved in the murder of George Floyd. It will slow things down and eventually stop,,,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Your choice of interview times seem to appear you're running scared. Other networks talk about what's really happening in America.

<|startoftext|>@dvillella @realDonaldTrump And mail in voters,,, we need to get as many people to the polls as possible. This is another way of rigging "Mail In Votes". There are a lot of people smarter than #45. He just don't know it YET,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dvillella @realDonaldTrump Well he won't be fundraising for #45 anymore.  He now has a new job. Looks like this has something to do with Amazon who has switched from the Post Office for major shipping to another shipping giant. You loose again #trumpy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Drain the swamp? Looks like 33M people who lost their job will not be voting for #trumpy. You were warned and you didn't listen. Now look at America,,,Farmers and especially the meat industry is suffering. It took COVID-19 for you to see the light. It's all gone because of you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump This should have been tweeted in early February. Not after the death of 73,435 people and the 1,229,089 people diagnosed with the COVID-19 virus. This is absurd and so is #45<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kimguilfoyle @UDelaware Why do you think this is a credible assault on Biden. #45 has abused women &amp; the office of president since day one. Why is tRump hiding from his past. Why dosen't tRump accept responsibility for what he's done in his past. He is not a king and will be held accountable in 2020.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan That was a lie right there,,,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You stole the election and look what you've done to America. 61,000+ lives lost, 30M jobs lost and tanking the economy. Not to mention the failed attempt to cover up your coronavirus  response so you could play golf. We're not stealing the election, we're taking our country back.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I'm sorry but this language is not presidential. I think it's time for u to go to bed. Why are you so upset?

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @MariaBartiromo Why is everything about money to you. Canada is giving  $8,000 to in 4 pymts to Canadians. What is $1,200. Rent, food for a month and a car note? Are you kidding me. You said America first. You are the biggest joke of a president. Looks like Karma is biting you very hard, Economy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mild_takes @DonaldJTrumpJr ,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChadPergram Shouldn't you be tweeting about the death in America due to this coronavirus? Obama is no longer President and the current president is like you, are tweeting and talking about fraud and the economy which will eventually rally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeditigger @kathy_pierson11 @BrandonBeckham_ @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump Preach<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrandonBeckham_ @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump Borders? What about the victims who never left the US or came in contact with anyone infected. "What Did The Borders Do"? Thousands of lives have been lost because of his slow response and thousands more expected. I speak for Christians who want to know why!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump Thousands of people have died because of tRumps negligence and you talk about CNN? You like getting bitten in the a** with your dumb comments. CNN keeps America informed of the truth about this pandemic. You should watch CNN. Maybe you'll learn something #POTUSIMPEACHEDFOREVER<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@designs_donn @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump Yep,,,she probably wants to be one of them<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@orangecrusher1 @mmpadellan Will do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The do nothing champion of its kinda late,,,The biggest president I've seen in a long time,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrandonBeckham_ @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Yeah, 2 months too late,,,people are suffering and dying,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yaaaaaaayyyyyyyy,,   https://t.co/Vs1f8kwkl6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is ssickening  https://t.co/bLsFuGUrk0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All these quotes are from tRumps mouth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrsRosefyre @dvillella @JJohnson2u @realDonaldTrump Exactly,,,tRump tested over night and got his results in less than 24hrs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump If its stupidity,  why are you addressing it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump If you say so,,,now more people by die by putting Americans back to work? You're going to see more Americans perish because the stock market is plunging. You need to get your priorities straight or get out of the White House. We don't want you there,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyOstroy @realDonaldTrump Exactly ,,, especially his base who believes everything he says<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @fereroroherfrap A wall cannot stop a pandemic. Why is this so hard for you to understand? Get a grip and stop thinking and praising you. America First means all of America not just rich America,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@princereebus @DonaldJTrumpJr This is who they are. Criminals!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr @BrandonStraka This tweet tells us all we need to know about you and your family. You tweet about solar panels, tax breaks and relief for airlines at a time like this. What about the PANDEMIC? You need to get your priorities straight instead of calling names, like your lying father.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewJshow @realDonaldTrump What is it with tRump supporters,,,they either can't spell and don't use their vocabulary correctly. It's hear, not here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Does #45 actually see what is going on. This isn't about the NY Times or the Democrats. This issue has gotten worse and worse because of a "do nothing president" who won't take responsibility for his lack of compassion for America. #VoteBlueNoMatterWho #VoteBluetoSaceAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Which way did the FDA move mountains? Up, down, left or right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelCoudrey @realDonaldTrump I wouldn't trust anything tRump agrees with in regards to vaccines. If the FDA did not give it the go ahead, I would not take the vaccine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelCoudrey @realDonaldTrump It has taken almost 3 months for #45 to retweet the dangers of the coronavirus. Why now??? Has any close to him been infected that makes him understand its effectiveness? So fake,,,he should have said this in January 2020 when he was first aware. #FakeConcernsNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @US_FDA @SteveFDA @CDCgov @DHSgov What happens if this combo does not work. You should test this stuff on your family before you test the public since you think it's a game changer,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sean Spicer was a prop by tRump in order to take the focus off the GOP Senators so he could mention Diane Feinstein as part of the group  Sean Spicer faces backlash for attending coronavirus briefing, asking Trump a question  https://t.co/vjiRj4iZvI #FoxNews<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SenatorLoeffler The only one politicizing the coronavirus is the #ImpeachedPresidentOfTheUnitedStates. He said the Democrats were doing it,,,,,but listen to him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump The most disrespectful person to Journalists in the world. Was Shaun Spicer a prop so you could #45 could mention Diane Feinsteins' name in selling off stock, the Stock Marke and, the Economy. This is about the Coronavirus #VoteBlueNoMatterWhoAmerica<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump RELAX,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump There are 20+ GOP Senators not seeking reelection, lots of Republicans that voted for you In 2016 not voting for you again, how is it that your approval rating stays the same at 95%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Yes we will PREVAIL,,,You WON'T 🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrandonBeckham_ @realDonaldTrump What type of science-based response did he apply? Oh, I  forgot he did say he was a scientist, genius. Does this science-based response have a name?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Sure,,,tell that to the people who lost loved ones. Your slow response will nullify any fake response you tweet. You could have done better,,, instead you sealed your fate by not reacting sooner. Bye #45<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Shut up,,,you could have slowed the spread back in January. But instead you said it was under control. 9 months and you will be voted out of the Oval Office on your way to your new coronavirus home<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump So why is America last to get the necessary testing supplies? Why are we running out of supplies? Why are the numbers of the infected rising instead of declining? You and  the GOP need to stop lying for this administration. This is an absurd statement and you know it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @Surgeon_General You people don't socially distance yourselves when #45 is at the podium lying. Why do y'all stand so close together?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Lying to your base again,,,,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So what makes this a Chinese a Chinese virus? Is it the food, is it the look, what? Grow up and act your age. This is called the Coronavirus #ImpeachhedForever #RESIGN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrGJackBrown @UROCKlive1 INCOMPETENT man. #45 did this to America and now he wants to try and appease us with $1,000? We need more than that,,,leave #45 and let someone else take over. #JoeBidenMicheleObama2020 oooh,,,wouldn't that be nice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@change_agent4 @GOPChairwoman @gdfuego @realDonaldTrump She's doing it now,,,she's in quarantine,,,sinking and sinking and soon to be stuck in the couch,,,,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Baligubadle1 @mmpadellan @realDonaldTrump Don't cry now,,,,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MP_Spears @thornton_mandy @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump History will judge this family!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump What about the test for coronavirus? Are you infected? Is the coronavirus eating your brain away? You tweet some things that are not relevant to helping Americans through this pandemic. Oh,,,I got it, you're looking for a job<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @CDCgov Where are the test? When you declined help from WHO, it appears you ordered death to some Americans. Now you say calm down. You blew it #45 and you should take responsibility for this debacle!!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Screenings,,,where are the test?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What about the coronavirus? Where are the millions and millions of test for America?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@okkie48 @realDonaldTrump This looks pathetic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump Has anyone told you there is a difference between testing and distribution? What a dumb thing to tweet. BTW, where did this distribution already take place and where the next distribution will take place,,,you tweet some stupid s**t,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump So you tested positive huh,,,,potus should have restricted you from traveling to the White House/Oval Office<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fras99 I believe it. Where is he and why hasn't he tweeted any bs today,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader You should have prayed that #45 would change, but you decided to support him and look where America is since he is Impeached F-O-R-E-V-E-R. The GOP has run its course and its time to be dismantled and eliminated from the White House and the senate. Bye bye,,,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realkatiejow Did you really ask that question while running for office?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realkatiejow How do you know you're not carrying it? Have you been tested?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@loretta043 @PalmerReport Wow,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump Have you tested positive Lindsay? Are you sick or something? What's the in the care package? American people have the right know the truth @LindseyGrahamSC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why haven't we heard from Donald Trump since his brief appearance at the press conference? By this time of morning, at any other time, he would be tweeting, bragging, calling names and disrespecting people. What's up with the president? Positive or Negative??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone believe America would be dealing with the coronavirus crisis at this level if #45 would have accepted the fact that it was serious and taken the help from the World Health Organization (WHO)?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarilynAuriemma @QuancyClayborne 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😅😅😅😅😅😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaseStudyQB @KSD371 @smerconish Sanders should step down and let the person better suited to beat trump continue on. This is the reason why Americans think the Democrats are not good because they attack one another. Time to stop dividing Bernie. Let it go. You're not the only one who lost twice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dvillella @DonaldJTrumpJr Did you tell your dad that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump #45 are you okay. You don't look so good and this is the second press conference you've left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DevinNunes @joelpollak They sure did and you knew about the pandemic and said nothing. You sat there and defended tRump and you knew you had been to Ukraine. I don't know why you so called highly educated people do not understand that eventually the truth will come out. "YOU GOT CAUGHT"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan I saw the Riteaide truck delivering supplies and was told to come early in the morning in order to get toilet paper. So I went about 7am and was able to get 24 rolls of Scott.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump When people die it's Gods will not Obamas will, nor Bidens will. Stop the lying blame game. We're on to it now and so is your base.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @kayleighmcenany @LouDobbs 10 times more lethal,,,,than Swine Flu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @kayleighmcenany @LouDobbs This pandemic is not over. Coronavirus is spreading like oil on the ground. Your numbers will be out soon,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrendaScriptun2 @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump Thank you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrandonBeckham_ @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden That may be true but people are testing positive who have never left the country. This coronavirus has been here since Dec/Jan. #tRump didn't accept tesfrom WHO. This is why we're here today. What science did #tRump use based on science? Denying help,,,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump How can you say that. There's no test. You don't have a clue as to how many people are infected. This was #tRumps plan all along. He said it would go from 15 to 0 at  CDC mtg. Is it 0 or is it over 2,000 and climbing. I hope this dosen't bite you in the a**.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany Has anybody told you how many test were administered. America knows its in the thousands. All you're doing is lying to keep his base but everyone is not stupid. #tRump lies with every word that comes out of his mouth. See you in November 2020 on the loosing end 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Be careful what you wish for<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Why do you keep lying to these people. You know dam well you don't want America to know how many people are infected. That's the reason you're holding onto to test but I hope you know what you're doing. Karma is a b**ch and that's not a hoax,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewYorkStateAG @AGKarlRacine This is why we love you,,,,You continue to support out State and take on this person who thinks he's above the law. Thank you,,,New York State appreciate you and all you do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDailyShow @lauferlaw Pass the virus on the right hand side. All these health officials and they don't understand not to shake hands or be in close proximity with a nut who was exposed to caronavirus ,,, this is absolutely amazing,,,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HKrassenstein @Yamiche Such a nasty man. Everytime a black journalist ask this fool a question he goes out of his way to try and embarrass them.He is the nasty one and he is sick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What about America and this Pandemic. I don't see Prime Minister Abe praising your handling of the "coronavirus".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Baligubadle1 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs He peed,,,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs The Swine Flu? How long ago was that. Stop trying to  compare yourself with President Obama. You have no where near the intellect he has. He is a very smart, well groomed person. You're painted with extra hair and heavy,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump So #SniffyDonald can blame President Obama and Joe Biden can't speak on the pandemic. You've got to be kidding me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Right, should never have been this way. You should have taken stronger measures when you first heard about this pandemic. Look what you have done to this country. We don't need you to lead us any more #SniffyDonald<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You called a State of Emergency at the Southern Border. Why not call for a State of Emergency with pandemic. Why don't we have more test? Where is the vaccine and why didn't you handle this in December/January. Oh,,,I get it,,,covering up to be reelected,,,,,,,Pitiful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennerific713 @realDonaldTrump No dummy, it's "If You Fail To Prepare Yourself,  Prepare Yourself To Fail".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glamelegance @realDonaldTrump Yaaaaaaayyyyyyy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I sure hope you have some good news and not a lot of misleading lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@okkie48 @realDonaldTrump @CDCgov I knew this is what this man was doing. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @CDCgov Time to stop blaming people from past administrations. This is your post now #45. With the election coming how do you expect people to vote for a Do Nothing Donald Trump. Do something and stop tweeting bs. 11,000 test in a country of about 350 million makes you look weak as POTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What about the dam test. Why dosen't America have enough test for its people. All you think about is freaking money. Yes, we need it to survive, but it won't do us any good in a grave. This will fall on this administration big time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdvocatAmy1 @sddphoto @NatashaBertrand The way he is grinning being so close to #45 and pence,,,he could've did it on purpose,,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SecPompeo @realDonaldTrump The number of test has declined in the past week. #45 does not want his base to know the real truth about this pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gone4good2 @DocTucson Looks like #45 is nodding or sleeping with his mouth open<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abe_GGKM @lauferlaw He said the test was perfect, just like the letter was perfect,,,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@inhofeforsenate You loose,,,,,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Why are you upset Bernie that didn't win? You appear to be scared that Joe Biden is coming for your a**. Can't wait to see that,,,,,, #VoteBlueNoMatterWho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You're just coming to that conclusion,,,this coronavirus has been around for at least 3 months and now that you can't control it you agree it's real? You blamed President Obama and the Democrats and you called it a "hoax". I hope you make some sense tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump @gen_jackkeane Did you get tested? You were at that meeting with your father,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What do you know about protecting all Americans. You and your adminstration don't protect all Americans. What are you talking about<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You should have started this in October/ December when you first found out. Now look at this mess you created because you don't want higher numbers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDailyShow Is he high on something? He's always talking about people and calling them names but #trump needs to take a seat,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Win, who is he running against?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Did someone tell you to say that,,,sounds like crap to me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump So did Joe Biden 😁😁😁😁😁😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyOstroy @realDonaldTrump Absolutely,,,every time he opens his mouth he lie, rambles on and don't know what he's talking about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Wait, you're reading a "Vanity Fair " magazine in the midst of a pandemic? Why didn't tests for this pandemic get started in October 2019 when it was first bought to light? Where are the tests? So much for doing a "great job". Can't wait to see you go.............<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jinxy_Minxy @charliekirk11 I think so. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidmweissman @charliekirk11 Sounds like he's looking for a position in the #trump administration<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bpjohnson5576 @charliekirk11 Thank you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump So I understand the coronavirus was known about, by this administration, since October 2019. Where was the president? Oh playing golf and getting fat as hell. Not  much of a difference huh,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump First you say Bernie surge, now its a bad day for Bernie? You don't know what you're talking about,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump How do you know? Is your daughters voter machines in the mix. Go do some work and stay out of peoples lives. You don't know what is gonna happen today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blackwomenviews @Q5Uptown Ok you're right. I'm not saying she wouldn't represent as a great VP but with her experience I think that being in criminal justice she would serve well as Attorney General also.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blackwomenviews @mikecollins2141 I love Kamala Harris and she would make a great VP.  However I think she would serve well as Attorney General. I loved the way she questioned Barr. Either way she will be a very strong asset to our country. I'm just saying!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Infantry0300 @ShadeyGreySkies @realDonaldTrump Well look at you. Is this a National Crisis?? What were you doing this past weekend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fras99 It would explode after the first 5 lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomJChicago Wow,,,I could not have said it better. He needs to be removed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump If you were not president you would not be calling Cuomos brother Fredo. I bet you won't do it without being surrounded by Secret Service.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I  knew you would accuse the previous administration of something. You cannot blame people for who you and your administration are. What a joke you are,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Some people get coronavirus just being around others with the virus who have no knowledge they having it. Calm down. You "STOPPED IT" right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I can't understand for the life of me why everything, people say and think is fake news. What's not fake is your orange spray on complexion and the three colors of hair you have. Your rhetoric is also "Fake",,, and misleading<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What is there to think about. Coronavirus is not just the flu. It's dangerous and spreading like wildfires. Get a grip mr president and stop try to defend the inevitable,,,this crisis is bigger than money and "You",,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The real question is if you knew since January that this viruse existed why didn't you order  test for America? Closing the border did not and will not stop, it nor will walls keep people from coming to America. You mishandled this crisis big time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Fake presidents are the Enemy of the people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan Nothing,,,Nada,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan You have a lot of "best friends " that have turned into your enemies and are now gone. I remember you saying you would hire the best people. Well #45 you did just that and now they are gone,,,what happened?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Why do you keep saying that about the MSM?. They inform America of the things they need to know unlike you who dosen't want your numbers to grow.  So pathetic,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar The hands, the hands, the little hands. The neck, the neck the huge neck,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MysterySolvent What am I suppose to be doing, I can't remember,,,I  can't remember<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I  thought we had a peace deal. Hasn't  started  Civil here in America but knows what the Taliban will do.  Shame on this Administration  https://t.co/Kdx9yVJgNC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #45 knew about the coronavirus since January, why didn't he start preparing for it and ordering the  testing materials then? He knew the market would tank, look at all the chaos its causing. He only care about the market not the American people. Look at the Stock exchange.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnLHamilton @mmpadellan All of them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuciaRendn4 @Jwheels_74 She can still do it if Dems win and make her Attorney General Harris,,,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnMTalmadgeMD It appears that Pence and his team, just being assembled less than a week ago, has done an extremely large amount of testing. How did that happen in less than a week. All #45 did was put a team together to keep America in the dark about the devastation of the coronavirus. SAD,,,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DiamondandSilk @ugotem1 That is a Bold Faced Lie. Shame on you to put a Black President down in Black History month. BTW, how are your pockets doing?

<|startoftext|>@VivaLasVader @ugotem1 @jerrysaltz Yep,,,I  support trump,,,20 years in prison and 20 probation!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BernieSanders Turn over your medical records,,,you're doing what #45 did. Making a promise to turn over documents and when you find yourself in the lead you change your mind.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @JohnJHarwood @CNN I don't think it's appropriate to be calling people losers at this time. Look at the Stock Market. You should really consider thinking before you speak and call names Sniffy Donald,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddale8 It sounds like he was talking about a military movie of the military Dr who wouldn't carry a weapon and only worked to help the wounded. Ridge something Hill. I don't remember the exact name<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar What about the 2 cases in California? These 2 people contracted the coronavirus in California. What is wrong with you? You can contract this virus just like anyone else can with all these people at your hate rallies. Do something and stop playing games<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@candy0311 @ryanstruyk @CNN Especially China where it originated from<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mikecollins2141 @CatintheHome @Forbes Affordable? Sniffy Donald trying to increase his wealth again. There should be no charge on anything threatening the lives of people.

<|startoftext|>@Paula_White 🤮🤮🤮🤮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump And you Sniffy Donald is allowing America to go down with your lack of actions and knowledge towards the coronavirus. Resign and take the Do Nothing VP pence with you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiamondandSilk @realDonaldTrump How much did you make showing up at the White House during Black History Month. Are you trying to stake a place in history? Well you are staking a place in history and it won't be kind to you. You're the laughing stock of America especially during this coronavirus crisis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glamelegance @realDonaldTrump He doesn't realize that Ebola is basically being dealt with and the Coronavirus has reared it ugly head and is even more DEADLY pace. America needs to prepare itself,,,this could go on longer than we think<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dvillella @realDonaldTrump Could it be in the hats, sweatshirts and T-Shirts you have made coming from China. Your base needs to be careful about showing up at your massive rallies. And,  your Black attire "Work" is so inappropriate and Blacks should steer clear of anything coming from you and China<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Time to stop defending yourself and blaming the Democrats. Do something about the crisis. Your hateful rhetoric and pointing fingers is not going contain this episode. Try something new,,,maybe it will work, but not blaming Democrats and finger pointing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glamelegance @realDonaldTrump We haven't seen these two since the election and now they show up praising this nut job, in the interest of increase on both parties behalf,  as if he's changed the world for Blacks. This is extremely embarrassing to African Americans of this country who despise @realDonaldTrump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Czar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thomaskaine5 Absolutely,,,in my opinion he should choose President Obama just to stick it to tRump. But I think Biden/Harris is an excellent combination<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HowardA_Esq What Sniffy Donald is trying to do is distract America on the devastation of the coronavirus to increase his worth. Why in the world would he tell any scientist, doctors or anyone with info to speak to pence before going public. It won't work,,,we will find out,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSNBC He is doing what #45 did by saying he'll release his medical information and now he's not. What else is he holding back. I would hate to see another Sniffy Trump episode,,,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Reuters Why sue now? Is it because the new acting DNI is a yes man to @realDonaldTrump administration and will do and say anything he tell them to do or say. Will he purge the last administration's findings? This is absurd and #45 needs to be taken straight to jail.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan With @SenSanders knowing Russia is helping his campaign be the main reason he is dominating the polls. I'm just not liking what I see.

<|startoftext|>@jaketapper @Brian_Chovanec Schiff was absolutely correct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You won in 2016. America is not happy to see you fire a Patriot and his brother for doing their job. This does not look too good in Iowa. Remember you honored a Patriotic Hero on Tuesday and fired one on Friday. That make you look like a mob boss, #ImpeachPotus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump No worries,,,SDNY will pick it up. Submit your DNA and see if you win the rape case.<|endoftext|>

It won't work in your favor impeached president #3. #VoteBlueNoMatterWho  #BlueTsunami2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It's time to stop gloating about African Americans to get them to vote for you. You have disrespected Blacks for a long time and that won't change if they vote for you and Blacks know you don't like them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>No such thing as total acquittal. You were impeached by Congress and you will forever carry that title. Your acquittal is for non removal from the Oval Office @realDonaldTrump. Time to stop making false statements<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I thought you had no dealings with Russia @realDonaldTrump. You lied to get where you are, and you will be  voted out of office. Remember 2018.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@karentravers How would people pay? This sounds like a threat coming from the Oval Office. What American president threatens his fellow Americans. Sounds like someone is trying to start a war or something. #VOTEBLUE2020  #VoteBlueNoMatterWho so we no longer have to endure threats from #45,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@karentravers Why should people have to pay for following their heart. This will be the worst year of the Impeached presidents term. Everyone needs to strap in because the worst of #45 is yet to come.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Please Read this Incriminating letter. It says every thing that the Trumpers hid from the public.

<|startoftext|>Bet he didn't know he was being recorded,,,but GOTCHA. All @realDonaldTrump does is complain in plain sight and does the exact opposite in privacy. He is a Hypocrite.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SenKamalaHarris, why can't this be a mistrial? THIS IS THE REAL HOAX!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenKamalaHarris @chrislongview Why can't you call a mistrial for his lawyer Cipollone for being in the office where Bolton said he was there and heard @realDonaldTrump demanded to hold aid on Ukraine? This is a miscarriage of justice? The fact that certain GOP Senators was paid to acquit #45 s/b a MISTRIAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisCuomo The idea that @realDonaldTrump dosen't believe he's done anything wrong is absurd. He knows what he is doing. The green monster (money) is what kept him in office. The Bible say "the root to all evil is money" and #trump and all his henchmen will pay for what they are doing,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngieGr60130939 @ChrisCuomo Absolutely!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MontyBoa99 @realDonaldTrump Its true<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What do you mean least among us? Are you saying black people are less than you because  of their color or because Ms Johnson was in jail. What a disrespectful to tweet,,,I hope she sees this so she can really see what you think of her. The least among us,,,WTF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Ignorance at its best coming from a grown man. No one talks about how your big hamberder filled belly hangs over your pants. You're not perfect you know,,,the neck,,,the V shaped neck,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 Its not just party over country, its money over party too. I knew it had something to do with money. I hope it was enough to keep them fed because every last one of them will be out of a job soon. I wonder if they got paid yet, because @realDonaldTrump dose not pay his bills.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>75% of Americans wanted to see a trial with witnesses. I hope the 75% of Americans that wanted a trial show up at the polls. #45 has to go. He will  cheat to win but America can overcome this tyrant. #VoteBlueNoMatterWho #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Its being reported that excerpts from Boltons book says tRumps lawyer Cipilone was in the office when @realDonaldTrump told him, Bolton, to dig up dirt on the Democrats. It is clear why #45s lawyers fought so hard to keep Bolton from testifying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You should go to China to help out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What about 2018?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mr_hottan @StewardshipAmer Thank you!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @michaelcburgess UH OH,,,Another one gonna go down,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shouldn't we call witnesses to help understand what @realDonaldTrump is hiding. This man Lev Parnas thinks so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You let Iran bomb a military base injuring 50 Soliders. Then you say the injury was just headaches. Now these injuries have been upgraded to Brain Injury i.e. Concussions and you did nothing. What a coward. I don't think you give a hoot about the military you brag about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder @realDonaldTrump or Lindsey know Lev Parnas is about to spill the beans on Lindsey Graham<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patijo62 @Terrence_STR I can't wait to find out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GwenKWashington @Terrence_STR I told my husband the same thing. They are all in the loop. Its all about the money and @realDonaldTrump will blow them out of the water if they go against him. Look at how he is trash talking Bolton.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pr_venus Because the truth is in the book. He knows that this book is going to blow him up. When tRump is removed or voted out of the White House, all his dirt is going to go public. @realDonaldTrump can't hide and America and his family will see it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Not,,,the best evidence is in the unredacted phone call. There are audio tapes, pictures of you and your family on numerous occasions with your buddy Lev. #BLUEWAVE2020 #VOTEBLUENOMATTERWHO You're going to prison Impeached president<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarshaBlackburn Because people like you Marsha act as if you don't what #45 did. Why not have witnesses. Your legacy will have to deal with what you did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRickWilson @IvankaTrump This is America's president. I had suspicion this would catch up with you. Now you're impeached.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump When you're out of Washington the swamp will be drained once and for all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Oh, I thought you didn't watch CNN? You watch them because they are accurate  and they fact check you all the time. You know you like CNN.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Why all the name calling. This is what the Senate, Congress and your entire staff think about you. Your ratings are the lowest in the history of a President at this stage of their term. Soon people will be calling you #JailbirdDonnie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Same reason you are adamant about turning over documents,,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@072Maga @badboiBreezy @dvillella @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Who said I was watching CNN? You? I heard the tape, I read the transcript. Its not my IMPEACHMENT falling apart.

<|startoftext|>@small4lyfe I feel when the House Managers ask for witnesses the trump lawyers will ask for the Bidens. The Bidens are not being impeached!!! This is crazy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@small4lyfe This whole defense is absurd especially after the Bolton bombshell hit the press. They're making it seem like the Bidens are on trial.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@072Maga @dvillella @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump No hun,,,you need to get over yourself. #45 is the one who released the transcript of the call.  Lev Parnas released the tape with #45 telling him to get rid of Amb Yovanovich and take her out. That's the tape I'm talking about. Listen to the tape<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr What about the Bolton news and the Parnas tape. You and your dad are doomed. Stop trying to justify what your dad is doing with these dumb tweets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The Democrats were told they'd be taken to court to fight the subpoena by Boltons attorney. Get your facts right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Sorry Donnie boy,,,you should never have held up the military aid period. It was not your money and it was approved by Congress,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump Because he and his attorneys are SCAAAAAARED of him  becoming UNHINGED and showing his true self in the public!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @70sRockbest If you did not tell John Bolton the aid to Ukraine was tied to the investigations into the Democrats and the Bidens, tell him to come in and testify. What are you afraid of? I know,,, you're afraid of Bolton telling the truth,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lauferlaw @realDonaldTrump SDNY on the way. He can run from NY but he cannot hide from NY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spydermary @Fuzzy_Fuzzbutt @realDonaldTrump It will be on White House attorneys head if America ends up under a #trump dictatorship and when their children grow up, they will live under their wrong doings.

<|startoftext|>@itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@axios I say Open The Floodgates. We need to hear from John Bolton and all the witnesses that are "In The Loop"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Listen to the tapes. Read the Bolton manuscripts. Stop lying to America and #RESIGN. Being president of America is not a #REALITYSHOW. It's time to stop with this READ THE "TRANSCRIPS!" nonsense,,,and By The Way,,,"YOU'RE FIRED" 🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump All lies,,,Zelensky wanted an official invitation to meet you at the White House not at the United Nations.  Now there is a  tape of you and Parnas and a manuscript of Bolton blowing you up. You need to #RESIGN immediately and stop pretending that you're innocent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dvillella @GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump They are all in the loop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump So what,,,@realDonaldTrump plays golf every weekend. By the way there is a picture of you and Lev Parnas. Is this the reason you're not running for reelection. tRump is IMPEACHED F-O-R-E-V-E-R,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dvillella @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Listen to the tape<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The tape "get rid of her". I don't know who Parnas is,,,but you're on tape giving him orders to take her out".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My heart goes out to the Bryant family. We will miss you and your legacy will live forever Kobe Bryant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What about your taped conversation with Parnos. "Take her out"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmoneyResists @HawleyMO They = GOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmoneyResists @HawleyMO I don't  know what he was watching. You are trying to tell a good lie. Anyone that watched the hearings saw no such thing. Grandstanding? Come on.

<|startoftext|>@okkie48 @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump Absolutely,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sdr_medco @MarshaBlackburn @realDonaldTrump Thank you. I just don't understand why the people can't see through #45. Now there is more new evidence with his on tape saying "take her out" referring to Amb Yovanovich<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>,,,dancing, dinner, a movie what? The leader of our country giving orders like that is scarey,,, I cannot stress how important it is to #VoteBlueNoMatterWho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So there is more information @realDonaldTrump on a tape. #45 is on tape telling Lev, the guy he claims doesn't know to "take her out" referring to Amb. Yovanovich. What exactly was he telling them to do? How were they suppose to "take her out".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Have you heard the tape yet? Listen to the tape as  @realDonaldTrump is telling Lev and  Igor to "take her out". What exactly did he mean, take her out? They can't fire her. Were they suppose to take her to lunch, dancing or a movie? This sounds like something very serious to me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Don't need them now. You're IMPEACHED already,,,F-O-R-E-V-E-R<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You are lying,,,Can't wait till you get escorted out of the White House.

<|startoftext|>@okkie48 You've been abandoned @realDonaldTrump and no one wants to help you. So called "best negotiator" than anybody. Abandoned and Impeached illegitimate president. What a joke you are and an embarrassment to the United States of America. #RESIGNALREADY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @Varneyco @FoxNews So why is the deficit so high? Are you pocketing this money or using it for family vacations,  your kids security,  GOLF. You said you wouldn't have time play golf,,, IMPEACHED  LIAR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepDougCollins You are very clear pastor. You said and you meant it.  You say anything to appease @realDonaldTrump. All you do is say iish that makes no sense and you lie to protect impeached, rapist and racist criminal. You need to get down on your knees and ask God for forgiveness pastor,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdwardTHardy Whose to say these threats won't still be carried out. One monkey don't stop no show,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdwardTHardy Absolutely true,,,Pompeo is trying a little too hard to make this point using phrases like "full stop and period". If there was a imminent threat to American sites when did they get this intel. Soleimani was not the one who would've carried these threats,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oNe_iLL81 @GAHRPIRATE @mmpadellan Too Bad,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrettBoggs2 @dvillella @realDonaldTrump I use to get upset that my husband watched the new all the time. Now, I've been watching the news everyday, all day since #tRump got elected. He really thinks he's charming but he's the dumbest person I've seen in decades. I can't wait until he gets voted out of office,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump #45 is the IMPOTUS who sent thousands of Americans into war zones of his making with no imminent threat to America and now he's begging NATO for help. How embarrassing you are,,,, #VoteBlueNoMatterWho  #VOTEIMPEACHEDPOTUSOUT MAKE AMERICA AMERICA AGAIN 2020.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan That she is and its killing #tRump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>,,,he wanted to undo Obama's plan so he could renegotiate it. I hope they all say no to his request. He will be gone soon anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't understand how @realDonaldTrump has the nerve to ask NATO for help when he's the one who took America out of the agreement. I hope France, Germany,   UK, China and all other leaders turn their backs on him just because of his stupidy. This was his plan anyway,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was no imminent threat to America for @realDonaldTrump to kill Soleimani. The threats to America was old news and nothing current. This administration and #tRump used this as a distraction from his impeachment. You're stilled Impeached regardless of what you do and say<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ContraryMeri @atrupar Absolutely,,,as stupid as @realDonaldTrump being president.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@belden_betty @mmpadellan Liars can't look you in the eye when lying. Nor can they look at the camera.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@democracyinper1 @ArianMoayed @kidsneedheroes2 Love the hat. Are they on sale,,,if so where?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArianMoayed @lrozen We need more people like this gentleman in America, who can see what's happening, to get out and vote this so called president out of office. He can't even pronounce the word "Tolerated" with the world watching. He said "Tolirided". What does that word mean?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WithForethought Just followed you to make up for any one follower who unfollow you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rubk2017 @mmpadellan Not a King, but a wanna be king<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan This so called president @realDonaldTrump should not be, and I'm  using his terminology, "Tolirided" any more. Who did America put in the WH. He is reading a speech that was  written for him and he still uses his own words. He needs help NOW. "Tolirided" is not a word<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GSmitty2016 @Amy_Siskind @realDonaldTrump @jdawsey1 Bots don't enlist 😅😅😅😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeathMayo @change_agent4 Nikki Haley is looking for a position in the WH and will say anything to appease to #tRump. Where did you get that information from @realDonaldTrump? You know he's a liar and so are you @NikkiHaley<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listen to Judge Napatilano say house should reopen impeachment inquiry @CNNPolitics @cnnbrk @MSNBC_Breaking @CBS @ABCPolitics @frann152<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Judge says House should reopen impeachment investigation based on new emails,,,  https://t.co/eWmVni6pap<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samueljcookiii @abbydphillip @Dartagnan_Llore Exactly,,,the same way the Quid Pro Quo got @realDonaldTrump impeached, this killing will get him out of the Oval Office for the illegally assasination of Suleimani and violating the War Powers Act<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CheesyKraftman @Strandjunker @realDonaldTrump Both,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@okkie48 @amvetsupport @realDonaldTrump So what. Send them to fight anyway. They might save each other from their father #LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Why is this "over his lifetime" just coming up. This sounds like Joe and Hunter Biden and the company Hunter worked for. Another "DISTRACTION" to steer America from @realDonaldTrump criminality and his Impeachment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricMMatheny @Sargeby1 What goes around comes back around<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dvillella @realDonaldTrump Wouldn't that be great,,,😁😁😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan @realDonaldTrump I second that,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PackersFavreFan @realDonaldTrump So do I.  Can't wait until November 2020 election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PackersFavreFan @realDonaldTrump Yup,,,he is scared<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMeltdown99 @dvillella @realDonaldTrump Especially with the bot accounts. Everything about #45 is fake,,,even his hair<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dvillella @realDonaldTrump Fake followers like fake president.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dvillella @realDonaldTrump Exactly,,,his base is shrinking especially since this war and the  deployment of our Soldiers started. Does he really believe he's gonna win again? Is this why he started a war?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You really think you are a king. Kings like you get impeached,,,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC @MariaBartiromo WTF are you so busy doing,,,killing people???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You need to read the transcripts and stop telling Zelensky to lie that it was no pressure. 90 minutes after the phone call to pressure Ukraine you froze the aid is pressure. Maybe you don't know what pressure is but Pelosi, Democrats and America knows...SAD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump How do you know they don't ready have one. Oh, I forgot you're a genius,,,🤣🤣🤣🤣 NOT,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@okkie48 @realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC @MariaBartiromo And guilty he is,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC @MariaBartiromo All you want to do is take peoples lives to prove something, including Americans. #RESIGN #BLUEWAVECOMING2020 #VOTEBLUENOMATTERWHO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC @MariaBartiromo So continue to be busy and Congress will continue to do its job. You've been Impeached so the Articles of impeachment is not weak. If the Republicans really cared about you, they would tell you to step down to save what dignity you have left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Maybe if you acted like a president and not a crime boss you wouldn't have to slaughter a man to win reelection. Now you're trying distract Americans from your criminality,,,but you got caught. Its over DOTARD,,,#RESIGNNOW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bpjohnson5576 @realDonaldTrump Of course he did,,,he said President Obama would attack Iran if he lost his second term but President Obama won. Now he knows he's a  loser so he attacks Iran and he doesn't care about the American lives that will be lost fighting this bogus war he started.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You sound like you're scared. Don't do the crime and the Democrats won't have to waste their time. You have been impeached and there ain't no more to say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoJoFromJerz @dvillella I wonder if @realDonaldTrump saw this crowd of angry people. If he did he'd say its the same amount of people at his inauguration. These people are angry and it all happened because IMPOTUS was infuriated by something Soleimani said, so he had him executed,,,SAD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OMGno2trump This is Stupid. It shows just how sick he is and how much he cares about this country.I wouldn't want a man  who is Impeached as a president on my mail,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/5Zi6vZ1aZP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Well @realDonaldTrump if you #RESIGN the Democrats  won't make you spend money on this very credible impeachment and so called hoax. You're loosing and many of your bases families will die bc  of your recklessness. Its always about money. What about the money you spend on golfing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Why as IMPOTUS would you threaten a country on twitter. This is not the apprentice reality show, this has everything to with Americas National Security. You need to stop tweeting this madness. For the sake of America. You're a threat to this country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_ReaalAmerican_ @RepSwalwell Absolutely true,,,just imagine his base whose families are being separated are going to war and they may never see them again...SAD and is being done for the russians<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarTheResister @jastein2002 I don't believe him either. His son Eric knew, #LindsayGraham knew and some of the people at Mara Largo  knew. He can't even keep a secret. Soleimani infuriated #tRump on twitter and now he is dead. What is going on. This man still believe he's about the law<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdPekarek @Gerry2834 @american2084 @TarikNiazi Thank you for the clarification<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joncoopertweets @SallyDeal4 @EricTrump Someone might drop a "can of whoop ass" on him just because,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maddow @Lady_Justice26 Oh please,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarleeTake @MtnMD Looks that way to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MtnMD So @realDonaldTrump was infuriated by a tweet from Soleimani, now Iranians are chanting death to America because Soleimani was killed on orders by @realDonaldTrump because of a tweet. It's time for IMPOTUS to get out of the Oval Office and go straight to jail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyBCampbell @cljmo This is so SAD,,,A lot of these people going back to combat zones are tRump followers/supporters and their families. I wonder if they still believe him now. No one believes he is telling the truth about this strike. Was it justified or not? I pray for everyone's safety<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DearGoodPeople @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @POTUS And ice cream,,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@american2084 @TarikNiazi Its called market manipulation,,,remember why and how Martha Stewart went to prison. Somebody needs to investigate what the hell #45 is really up to. I would say it includes distraction,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flitchy8959 @Mw19imp @AmbJohnBolton Retweet to many people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So why didn't you put a hold on the funds in 2017 and 2018. Is it because Vice President Biden decided to run. There is a lot of new and good stuff in tthese emails #45. Instead of rallying all the time, why don't you come testify and clear this iish up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mw19imp @AmbJohnBolton Why the name callling,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fly_Sistah @TheRickWilson All about him. I've been saying this right after his inauguration. He predicted what he would do if he became president and lost his first term. He just didn't know he would get impeached too!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I sure hope you explained to @realDonaldTrump the implications of what he did and that he is still Obstructing Congress. Impeach and Remove!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@encinitas99 @mmpadellan Doing Putins bid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan @cljmo Yes,,,He is still Obstructing Congress,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politvidchannel @cljmo Total distraction from @realDonaldTrump. Ineffective Negotiator,  Illegal IMPOTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedTRaccoon @AmoneyResists The entire GOP and #45 should resign immediately and take Pence and Pompeo with them,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavePowersG @AmbJohnBolton For @realDonaldTrump and @AmbJohnBolton<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mw19imp @AmbJohnBolton Make this go VIRAL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@morten @realDonaldTrump Lets make this video go viral to show who @realDonaldTrump really is and what his intentions were all along. This video was recorded in 2011 during Obamas second  campaign for President. Please RETWEET until #45 is gone,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baktear4 @morten @realDonaldTrump During President Obamas campaign for his second term. Now he knows he is going to loose @realDonaldTrump decided to do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@morten @realDonaldTrump Thank you @Morten. This is exactly what #trump said President Obama would do if he lost the 2nd election. Since he didn't loose, #45 decided to do it because his reign is over. You need help @realDonaldTrump. #VoteBlue2020 #VoteBlueNoMatterWho #BlueWaveComing2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@okkie48 @jimsciutto @realDonaldTrump So now after Melania said she want "peace on the world" you release bombs to blow up Iran. Is this what "peace on the world" looks like. This is not good. Tell your son Eric to stop tweeting your intentions before they actually happen. He has no security clearance...SAD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VicStoddard That can of whoop ass should be his ass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It has happened,,,Americans will die because of this. So all you tRump supporters who say #45 can do no wrong and he's bringing our troops home, well he lied again to your faces. He is sending Americans to the the Middle East. Lots of Soldiers won't be coming home,,,SAD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Nope,,,it didn't fail. #tRump is IMPEACHED period. 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @cvpayne America has never experienced anything like you in its history. You divided this country, you're starting a war with Iran and you're bringing more and more division with your iish. You are the "witch" that got caught.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump #45, it is the CRIME OF THE CENTURY and some of your cronies are in jail which is where you will be going once the SDNY steps in. You're not a king nor are you above the law<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump You're on notice too #LindseyGraham 😁😁😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Is that what #tRump is doing to you. You seem to be very knowledgeable on this topic #LindseyGraham<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump #LindseyGrahm doesn't care about or try too protect Americans. Why should anyone listen to you!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThisWeekABC @realDonaldTrump What do you expect? She gets more new evidence everyday. Calm down you will get exactly what you asked for soon.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@irishson1916 @realDonaldTrump Yup!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The Impeachment is still going on. though. New evidence is still coming out. Did you hear what Judge Roberts said?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenJohnKennedy @realDonaldTrump Senator Kennedy it's time for you to go now. You don't know what to say. Your legacy will be one of the worst top 8 ever recorded. When you don't know what to say, shutup and don't say anything...period...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Acyn Sounds like someone is upset because they are not overrated. You as president should not have asked her. You should have released the funds. The money is not yours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeJUofAR @jastein2002 @RepGosar @azdemparty @IndivisPrescott @IndivisibleofAZ Wow,,,the GOP are pathetic men and woman and will be remembered for years to come. What a legacy to leave for their families,,,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kurtmichaelson @SenSchumer @RepAdamSchiff Hearsay is what the witnesses heard #45 say and they reported it. Ms Hill was all they needed,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedlieu Now most of the Republicans are going to retire. I wonder why.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@okkie48 @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Since you're always talking about people and calling them names, tell me what does that neck look like. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends You are pitiful. Being #45 is not about you and the nice things people say about you. Its about the entire Country of the United States of America. I can't wait to see you leave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Wow,,,How long ago was this attack. Instead of tweeting about Joe Biden and the Democrats that "Impeached" you, this should have been tweeted 5 minutes after it was reported,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You don't want no part of Joe,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Hey #45,,,Joe Biden was not impeached, Joe Biden is not on trial,,,you are. Your children are working in the WH with no security  clearances, using prohibited email accounts, getting paid big money and getting patents from other countries. What,,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Randomwatcher4 @realDonaldTrump Don't forget he knows more about "Windmills" than anyone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You said if President Obama didn't win his second term he would start a war with Iran,,,So instead you're starting a war before you're removed from office.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Why don't you do some presidential work instead of bashing Americans and their districts. This is not how presidents act. Real Presidents help America and her people,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You have to defend yourself because of you. No one told you to think you were the "chosen one". You have disrespected leaders/people all over the world bc you think your smarter than everybody else. But you're the one who got "IMPEACHED" and no leaders want to deal with you.<|endoftext|>

A man who is hated by World Leaders and who mock people with disabilities. They don't want to deal with you for another 4 years.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Nobody wants to hear from you. You're being impeached. A respectful man would accept what he did wrong and walk away.

<|startoftext|>@dvillella @realDonaldTrump Tweet of the day!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You are the joke,,,come in and clear things up. Let your cronies testify. What are you afraid of #45. You make this a bigger joke than it is. Show yourself and clear this up if its a joke.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RepDougCollins is yelling again and making no sense. No matter how much yelling he does #tRump will sit in the history books as an impeached president. The sad part is he won't learn anything from this. Stop yelling or you'll get a hernia #DougCollins<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@siano4progress He doesn't look you straight in the eyes while he is lying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QuancyClayborne dOnald tRump is a fraud,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump why would you attack a 16yr old young lady and say and when someone mentioned your son Baron's name you and @FLOTUS blow her up on twitter. You are a bully and no one will respect you for this. You need to Chill and loose some weight. Get a neck lift,,,#VNECK<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 That's right,,,KARMA will bite Matt gaetz in the behind sooner than he think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To sit here and watch this debate is sickening. The world is laughing at the GOP. I hope Hunter Biden sue #Gaetz pants off. He is despicable and petty and should not be in Congress. I wouldn't want him to represent my State.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump This will go down in HISTORY as the most corrupt, lying administration ever. And the lawyers,  prosecutors,  judges act as if they don't see what is going on. It's not fraudulent point, its the truth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump If you thought Ukraine was so corrupt,  why would you ask them to do us a favor, though? This is the dumbest thing I've ever seen in my life. Why would you ask a "Corrupt" country to do us, the United States of America, a favor though. They are not the corrupt ones, you are,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Why don't you come before the Committee and clear things up. I think its because you will do exactly what Mulvaney did. Tell the truth. "That's why we held up the funds". The truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @NBCNightlyNews @CBSEveningNews @ABCWorldNews @realDonaldTrump He should be doing some presidential work instead of watching TV. @realDonaldTrump is guilty and you can't prove otherwise<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @brithume @BretBaier When you can't remember,  you need to go. You not remembering is not good for America. You're hurting United States of America<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Oh, now you're trying to be and act like a president. #PLEASERESIGNNOW #PLEASE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You won't end the anything. The Democrats did it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I thought they were Do Nothing Democrats????? You are a weak leader and you got to go. You should resign in order to keep the 1% of dignity you have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamParkhomenko @realDonaldTrump Absolutely,,,what are you hiding?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Michele48016832 @AdamParkhomenko @realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Adam Schiff did answer to this. Impeach #45 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What has the FBI done to you to make you hate/fire them. You put yourself in this position so now deal with it. You cannot run over America in the same fashion as Putin  does Russia. Maybe you should run for President in Ukraine. This is the wrong Country for that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshgerstein @KlasfeldReports Just like his testimony,,,,,,,,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Steve Castor is blowing it for the Republicans,,,he can't even read his own notes. What is the defense of #45? Sounds like there is none,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec @POTUS @realDonaldTrump So why won't POTUS let Pompeo, Mulvaney and Bolton testify? Why didn't he show up to testify? America knows why. #45 is guilty and Steve Castor has not said one thing in the defense of #45 nor is he making any sense. GOP could've picked a lawyer to defend the #LiarInChief<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DevinNunes @realDonaldTrump @DailyCaller You and Nunes will reach low ratings while you both are sitting in jail. SDNY coming,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NM_Che56 @KlasfeldReports It's obvious he was a plant,,,probably got a nice paycheck as well,,,#ijs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NM_Che56 @kurtbardella @DrJasonJohnson 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This man sounds like a fake preacher standing in front of a brainwashed congregation telling them why they should give him their last bit of money to benefit him. Question Is: What is your defense  @RepDougCollins??? Defend #45 if you have one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You say it but you don't mean it.,,,Your America first is only for the 1%. What about the rest of America who depend on the government assistance, i.e. Medicaid, Food Stamps, housing or even a monthly stipend? What about those Americans?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanScavino @realDonaldTrump This is the Stupidest thing I've ever seen. He won't even live to 2048 or 4ever. The things people do for money. The Bible says Money Is The Root To All Evil. Its unbelievable what people will do and say for money.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So you changed your Bot information. We know a Bot when we see one. Its been said you signed on a substantial amount of Bots and now you're telling your base to listen to them. BUSTED again. You will never win by cheating again.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@speechless299 @_ReaalAmerican_ @GOP @realDonaldTrump @GOPChairwoman Money,,,Cash Money<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump You need to stop putting this fake information on twitter. You know this is crap. If #45 is so innocent why does he stop people from telling the truth,,,why won't he come forth and exonerate himself. Oh, I know why,,,He is Guilty as sin and you know it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tracy9672 @lmresists @MelissaKDavis2 Following now,,,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dvillella He can add as many bots as he wants to. We know how to identify them. It's a shame that the sitting president has to cheat his way back into the White House.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Hey Jr it's vile for your father to separate babies and toddlers from their parents and lock them in cages. Its disgusting and vile that these children won't even remember their parents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump So why don't you tell #MoscowMitch to do his job and sign the bills on his desk. This is for America,,,not Canada and Mexico. #45 said America First. Not USMCA first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @NATO None of the younger handsome leaders want to deal with you. They are true leaders who represent their countries with dignity. They don't sit on national TV at a NATO Conference and bash their own country like you do. You embarass America. The whole world is laughing at you!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You heard one of the Professors say something to that effect and now you're tweeting about it. You also said you would have Giuliani and your AG call. Still lying to your base. Like Nunes said "you got caught". #Resign,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You were successfully laughed at by World Leaders for a second time in public, remember at the UN when you said they were laughing with you. Why would people laugh with you? You're not even funny and they were laughing at you #45 🤣🤣🤣😁😁😁😅😅😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FLOTUS Your husband has immigrant children locked up in cages for months. You never said one thing about it. Now you want to say Ms Karlan should be ashamed,,,you should be ashamed of what your husband is doing to children in cages who don't even remember their parents,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gregolear Hopefully #45 will be out of the Oval Office so he won't be able to pardon him. For the life of me I can't believe these supposed smart men let tRump get them caught up like this to win an election. More to come. I mean go,,,to jail<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AndyOstroy @JustinTrudeau @realDonaldTrump What is he blabbering about,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMattGaetz @realDonaldTrump ,,,#45 will not protect you. He will throw you under the bus just like he's doing Giuliani,,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMattGaetz @realDonaldTrump I can't believe you grown men are letting #45 trap you. Look at the people sitting in jail or are about to be sentenced to jail. Your actions are going to land you on the bottom side of your legacy. Keep lying and we will see you all, the GOP, in orange suits<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump How much did you pay him???????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Mini Mike has more money than you,,,I'd be careful calling him names #VNeck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump We read the transcript,,,,,and you did put pressure on Zelensky in order to get dirt on Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @MariaBartiromo Prove the Democrats are getting killed in their home districts. Another lie,,,you can't win without lying and cheating<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump American people have no idea what USMCA is all about. "Quid Pro Quo" you sign mine,,,I'll sign yours. You know the ones, 300+, sitting on #MoscowMitchMcConnells desk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Is that the first time you shook Sen. Tim Scotts hand? Looks like a Comey handshake,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @GreggJarrett 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @MariaBartiromo If you can tell over 13,000 lies and get away with it, so can Adam Schiff except he is not lying. This process is done according to our Forefathers. If you ever read it you would be as educated as Adam Schiff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What about the ones who committed suicide over your tariffs?  Ever think about them and their families<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>These stories have to be shared with the Media, @MSNBC, #CNN @FoxNews @CNBC,,,this is why #45 hates the media,,,they tell the real story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShadeyGreySkies @okkie48 He also doesn't care about the legacy he will leave for himself,,,this is the worst presidential situation I've seen in my lifetime,,, #VOTEBLUE2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@okkie48 @ShadeyGreySkies He doesn't care about climate change because he claims he doesn't believe it,,,what will his family, grandchildren and friends say about that in the years to come. He is setting them up for disaster,,,because he don't believe it,,,what a mess!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarbMcQuade @mushroomfeet He's throwing Rudy Giuliani under the bus as everyone predicted he would.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@okkie48 @thedailybeast @realDonaldTrump should never talk about Adam Schiffs neck. He called him little neck Adam. He needs to look at his own neck. It looks like a female part,,,something I can't say<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iTweetyNerd CNN didn't break the news,,,CNN reported it as breaking news. You may want to think twice before going up against CNN and Chris Cuomo,,,you're the one that will be running and they will track you down because of this bogus lawsuit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomiahonen @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson He should not hold a TV position in America.  Carlson needs to be in Russia if he is rooting for them. Was there a paycheck??????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Not expanding,,,replacing !!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyfullyDazed @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Exactly!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Its not building a wall. If you're taking down a broken wall and replacing it with a different wall you're replacing it. Mexicans are still climbing your new wall,,,it may be going up fast but it a replacement of something you tore down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@okkie48 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews That's all he does is lie, lie, lie. At this point I don't think he can tell the truth,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Is that all you've done so far? What about the deficit being so high,,,add that to your list of accomplishments and explain why it is so high. Impeachment polls show 50% to impeach and remove, while 43% disapprove,,,Fox is lying to you and you know it,,,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tribelaw What won't #45 person do to protect these dictators do. It's time to get this imposter and his cronies out of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the White House. Pompeo always had a smirk on his face but it appears the smirk is gone,,,he is just as guilty as #45,,, #VoteBlue2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KatrinaPierson @realDonaldTrump @TheDailyShow 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,,,believe this bs if you want to. What has he done for black people. Its not going to happen. How do you know what Black people are going to do? Oh I get it, you're black,,,right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IiBensinger @realDonaldTrump He is not the president of people,,,he is the president of the Country. I sure would not take a bullet for this  wanna be a dictator. This narrative is not America first,,,its #tRump first. You can die if you want to,,,Not me, I've go too much to live for,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoWay7790 @realDonaldTrump You are exactly right. He reaches out to who people who  believe his lies. Remember he said on National TV  "What You Hear and What You Read Is Not What's Happening". These people really believe this and he's not doing a dam thing for them,,, #VoteBlue2020,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SallyDeal4 @realDonaldTrump This will backfire in #Trumps face at the polls,,,,,,,,,,, #VoteBlueNoMatterWho2020 #QuidProQuotrumpHasGotToGo every time #Trump opens his mouth is a Quid Pro Quo,,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SallyDeal4 @realDonaldTrump The military are the ones who turned Gallagher in because he broke military laws. I think this will go against @realDonaldTrump as far as military is concerned. The majority of military voters don't like his ethics and how he runs the country,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump We know this Admiral to Norway will do whatever you tell him to. If he doesn't he will be fired. This is getting tired you firing people who knows you are not aware of what is going on. This is not the apprentice. AMERICA DID NOT VOTE FOR A WANNA BE DICTATOR,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You are the only one worried about the 2020 election. If you're so innocent you would only have to say it once not tweet it all day everyday to your base so they can remember your lies.

<|startoftext|>@tomiahonen @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump Fox hires only people who will say whatever they tell them to say. I wonder if they lie to their significant others, their children and families the way they lie to America everyday. I Boycott @FoxNews and listen to true news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bml_khubbard @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Witch Hunt? It is so sad to see America being used by @realDonaldTrump for putins sake.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Lies, lies,,,lies,,,That's what Nunes and the corrupt Prosecutor of Ukraine told you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Lies,,,Ms Hill threw you under the 10 buses and 5 trains. The real news is your buddy boy Devin Nunes and he is direct evidence after we hear from Parnas who will confirm a Quid Pro Quo,,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump DEVIN NUNES IN VIENNA,,,,Why don't Fox news talk about that. He is toast and you're toast with orange marmalade,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Did you hear about Nunes in Vienna where you sent him to get dirt on Biden. You guys are so sloppy as crooks. You're not even good crooks,,,Giuliani said if tRump throw him under the bus that has insurance,,,Is that car insurance 😁😁😁😁😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill They were "All In The Loop"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Did @DevinNunes tell you this crap after he  visited Vienna and met with Guilianis partner to dredge up dirt on the Bidens. Time to stop telling the fake stories to the public because you, @DevinNunes and your group of cronies, the GOP, "Got Caught". Say something about Nunes,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 what a joke. Americans know what they heard. You are so petty with these videos and you need to stop spreading lies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Tell the Do Nothing #MoscowMitch to sign some of the 250+ bills on his desk. Quid Pro Quo,,,you #MoscowMitch sign bills,,,Democrats sign bills i.e. USMCA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And they talk about Hunter Biden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff  This might be interesting to me you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmbJohnBolton You should come and clear this impeachment inquiry up. Show some patriotism and testify. America is waiting,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Oh 62 million people voted for you and 65 million voted for Mrs Clinton. You can't win without cheating and you're begging russia to do it again. America knows what you're doing. You are not fooling anybody.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump No they haven't. You have disgraced out country trying to bribe a Ukraine leader to say they were going to do the investigation and that russia did not hack our elections. We already know who is at fault,,,YOU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@woodruffbets Mulvaney stood before a room full of reporters and told the truth and he told America to get over it. We don't need him to testify. He already testified. Thank you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DevinNunes ,,, what does Dems have to do with tRump being a crook. Give it up dude,,,Ukraine had nothing to do with election meddling. You cannot seriously reject Ms Hills or Mr Holmes testimony. You were not there,,,they were there. This was not hearsay.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PressSec @POTUS @realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😅😅😅😅😅😁😁😁😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec @POTUS @realDonaldTrump He has been calling this a "Hoax" since the impeachment hearings started. Now he's saying he wanted nothing. He said there was no quid pro quo. Now there is a quid pro quo. Make up your mind. He knows what he did and so does America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr Hey #MoscowMitch why won't you sign the bills on your desk. You need to take a seat at your desk and sign the bills that have been sitting there for a while. #PresidentPelosi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davis5_krista @HillaryClinton Yep,,,Go Home president tRump for 2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan What happened to Jim's eye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is Gym Jordan always yelling. He got laughed today. Everybody involved should be prosecuted and go to jail!!! Trump, Pence,, Pompeo and Giullani<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani So why were you there?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@babyruth1994 @morten @RudyGiuliani 😅😅😅😅😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRickWilson This is sad,,,this is who people voted for and put in the White House. It's time to clean the house.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Everyone' hair is on fire<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tmancares @_ReaalAmerican_ @dcexaminer @EliseStefanik @realDonaldTrump Wow,,,name calling!!! Hmmm,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_ReaalAmerican_ @dcexaminer @EliseStefanik @realDonaldTrump Because he got caught<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump We do not need to read the transcripts now. We are listening to Ambassador Sondland.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You should have waited until 11/20/19. Your 1M dollar donor just said there a quid pro quo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @RepMikeTurner But,,,Sondland has just made the case,,,though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Not a "Hoax". You should be ashamed of yourself lying to America the way you have been.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump How will you go down #45? I know, you will go down as "TRAITOR OF THE UNITED STATES" along with Vice President Pence, Secretary of State Pence and your personal attorney Mayor of America Rudy Guiliani. Bye Ya'll.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump No one wants to deal with a liar and chief for holding up military funds. You're done and you need to #RESIGN now!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VP @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump You have been implicated by Amb Sondland, in this quid pro quo to hold up military funds for Ukraine. Any comments Vice President Pence? It is a shame that a  Christian like you would let a man like tRump get you caught up in this mess. You are in the loop. #ResignNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanShead Actually we don't need the whistleblower,. The whistleblower<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😁😁😁😁😅😅😅,,,🍔🍄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AustinDavisBro1 @Turbo_Mike @WhiteHouse He should use his own account instead of trying to be  incognito,,,the world knows who tweeted this crap<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse Why are you tweeting on the White House account. Did someone tell you to stop intimidating witnesses because it looks bad,,,SAD that #45 has to be told to stop<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrChuckUFarley @siano4progress @WhiteHouse Because I lied for #45.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Not,,,,#BlueTsunami2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepAndyBiggsAZ @WhiteHouse @RepStefanik Wait for Sondland to testify. We are really going to hear the true story,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Shut up and stop tweeting until you make some sense,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan @realDonaldTrump @Jim_Jordan who released the funds, #45 or Bolton?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveScalise You did the same thing to President Obama. What goes around comes around. Stop acting like sore losers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump It was fair when you did it to President Obama.  Why not now. You grown men who has represent the Republican people are putting tRump before all you ever stood for in life, your Country and integrity. What are people going to think about you when he's gone?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Well tRump,,,America will decide on November 3, 2020. Bye,,,bye Donnie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Lies, Lies and more lies. You really don't know how to tell the truth,,,SAD....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Where's the gun law, the lower drug pricing, infrastructure and more. Oh, look on #MoscowMitch's desk. He's holding these things up to use as leverage to get you and himself reelected. It won't work because we already know what you're doing to America. Traitor for Putin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lady_Justice26 @tomiahonen @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Done,,,#LickMulvaney<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@okkie48 @CBSThisMorning @CBSNews That's exactly what #45 is doing. He really believes he is above the law. I truly hope America has learned a lesson on Election day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Yes we do know how its going to end. @realDonaldTrump will be voted out of office, more of his cronies will turn on him and he will be found guilty by SDNY and sent to jail for a long time. Can't blame nobody but yourself Donnie boy!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoWay7790 @realDonaldTrump And the list keeps growing,,,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Where, in Russia,,,definitely not in America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dvillella @realDonaldTrump tRump needs to remember Martha Stewart<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrudenceFaulkn9 @sandyhook Can't blame Congress. It's #MoscowMitch that needs to move. Congress has done their.  The real question is why are 200 bills sitting on his McConnell's desk. Are they trying to bribe Americans by telling them the Dems are "do nothing". No, its McConnell who is holding things up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffreyGuterman @NikkiHaley She is now coming to the defense of tRump to draw attention to her book,,,,sorry I'm not buying it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dvillella @NikkiHaley @NikkiHaley So #45 calling people "scum" is acceptable to you as opposed to George Conway calling someone "trash". What's going on here is you kissing  up to tRump. This tweet is absolutely unacceptable and disgusting coming from you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngelaBelcamino ✋✋✋✋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sddphoto One reason, I believe is they are waiting for clearance on his tax return.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VicStoddard Wow,,,he'll be looking for a pardon soon,,,but won't get on in the SDNY,,,,,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan Hey @Jim_Jordan ,,,is this true,,,you should be a shame of yourself,,,#RESIGN or get #VOTEDOUT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andylassner @Jim_Jordan @mattgaetz @GOPLeader @DevinNunes @senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump Absolutely,,,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AndyBeattie9 @Mary_Miskanis @robreiner 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThePubliusUSA I was under the impression, according to the GOP, that @realDonaldTrump released the funds. Bolton needs to be subpoenaed to testify and clear this up for America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You tried to bribe Zelensky and you got caught. Germany and France (Europe) have nothing to do with you trying to bribe Ukraine. Leave them out of this and that was your first excuse. You've been doing this kind of thing for  so  long, and got away it until you became #45.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@by_rhonda @Mrtimrock @realDonaldTrump ABSOLUTELY,,,They are truly missed,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Now that the transcript of their testimonies have been released, invite him to come back on your show and have him explain to America what this exciting news is. It sounds like a fiddle to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Donnie, you're the one who started with the no "qid pro quo". Not Adam Schiff. It is really sad to see these rich people, who don't want to loose huge tax break, come on @FoxNews and spread lies to the American people. Its sickening,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iTweetyNerd @realDonaldTrump Happy 25th Birthday,,,enjoy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pradeepraturig @realDonaldTrump @EliseStefanik Looks like tRump train to the penitentiary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It is time to stop trying to intimidate the witnesses. These people can't be lying on you under oath. But, you won't go under oath because you'll probably freak out. There has got to be some truth in these accusations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SallyDeal4 @realDonaldTrump I wonder if @realDonaldTrump still loves Wikileaks,,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr But George is still with his wife,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You're an illegitimate criminal president and when you go to jail no, amount of money will get you and your cronies out of jail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@siano4progress And tRump keeps on loosing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanLizza Absolutely,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blakesmustache @ShadeyGreySkies He sure did,,,that was one of the electrifying moments today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not hearsay anymore,,,tRump was heard loud and clear that he's interested in the big things. Sondland to trump, "he loves your ass"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayMontano @StewardshipAmer @realDonaldTrump Amen,,,God is a God of Love!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FunmanDave @waltshaub This is so sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar Why do they have those stupid signs behind them. Are they on a picket line or something,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jammie04038 @irishson1916 @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@morethanmySLE @Jim_Jordan Praying for your health and strength<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StewardshipAmer @realDonaldTrump He threatened a witness on national television and you're still kissing his but,,,you need to get on your knees and ask God for forgiveness,,, christian<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMarkMeadows @RepChrisStewart Did #45 threaten a witness in real time?  Yes,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HouseMajPAC She should run for President<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@morethanmySLE So sorry he's going to Florida. He needs to get his own Island so no one has to ever see him again. He and his little hands and things 🍄 can walk around naked if he wants to. Bye #45. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #VoteBlueNoMatterWho2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EliseStefanik Karma baby,,Schiff and Obama is not on trial. You support a criminal in chief bc you're afraid he will blow you up. Put you big boy pants on and stop trying to convince people to believe a liar. He threatened this woman for telling the truth and you're mad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Witness Tampering,  Lying to Congress, Intimidation and obstruction of justice, some of the  counts Stone is guilty of. @realDonaldTrump is doing these very things today. You're next #45.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Roger Stone is guilty,,,your dad is next. BTW jr, the Democrats are doing their job<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Roger Stone found guilty!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Sitting in the chair next to you. It could be Lindsey Graham, Mitch McConnell, Matt Gaetz or anyone else close to you. It could even be Gym Jordan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMarkMeadows @realDonaldTrump You must be getting an extra paycheck too,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @RepRatcliffe I thought you didn't watch the impeachment hearing,,,you stand in front of America and lie like a mangy dog.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@morgan313 @DevinNunes Thanks,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DevinNunes This is too cute. But did you really sue a make believe cow?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Strandjunker ✋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bloomin3pa @mattgaetz You nailed it. Why now? Because Biden poses a threat to #45 in 2020 and he was trying to start a smear campaign on Joe Biden and Hunter Biden but it backfired on him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShadeyGreySkies @BeeRadDev1 @robreiner The best tweet of the day,,,so far @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robreiner Unfortunately @robreiner, the republicans will not vote for an impeachment. But this trial will stain #45s reputation,,,and while he's in prison he will wish he had been a better person. #LockHimUp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan you want the person who started this whole thing. #45 is your man, not the whistleblower. Thank you @PeterWelch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec @POTUS 😅😅😅😅 you're funny. Most Americans have not spoken to #45. Yup,,,in a presidential impeachment witness do not have to have dinner with #45 to know he's a criminal destroying our democracy and putting our security in jeopardy. He's a liar and a crook.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMattGaetz @realDonaldTrump @Jim_Jordan Jim Jordan didn't nail a thing. 98% of the country never met dOnald tRump and we know he is a crook.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It would not have been televised if these dummies didn't act like children saying we want a public hearing or crashing a hearing. Republicans should be careful what they ask for because they end up getting it. I say deal with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulLidicul This ish is really scary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lee8772 @oscarbeaglesmom Thank you ,,,I figured Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell were in Russian money. This is great. Thanks again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Strandjunker  https://t.co/tB6zv0ZvoF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HKrassenstein It appears that everything he touches loose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrierWHStaff She said she teaches her children not to lie, but with the 14000+ lies #45 told, she thinks he's truthful.  Yeah, she is interviewing for the VP spot. She is as fake as #45 is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/5mA0riQguw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffreyGuterman @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @EconClubNY Its really no surprise. He said he did know Sondland, the man who put 1M into his campaign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump That's fantastic. This is not you country and we are not your people. You are the one that needs to leave and seek asylum in one of the countries you betrayed America for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan @realDonaldTrump You said you were going to release it Tuesday. We know what you're doing,,,editing and trying to make it sound perfect. But, the first transcript, summary, is all we need. Stop playing yourself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Whining again, blaming everyone but yourself. You like a 4 year old trying to tell his teacher he did his homework and he know he didn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still loosing,,,  US Judge: Trump Can't Sue NY in DC to Block Tax Return Release  https://t.co/x8f3VQIqsZ #Newsmax via @Newsmax<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So who wrote that speech....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump You left a couple of things out,,,using Charity monies you raised to line your pocket and to build the wall that Mexico was going to pay for<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump So stop trying to identify the whistleblower then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump To you it's perfect,,,I read it and you did a Quid Pro Quo and Mulvaney confirmed it. Get over it  and deal with the consequences #45<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRynheart 🤣🤣🤣😅😅😁😁😁 Just like your lying DAD,,,he said he'd just finished reading the book, but how could he when he was tweeting all day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr What are Republicans doing about the bills sitting on #MoscowMitches desk? Why doesn't he get them signed and approved?0 Thank you Democrats for smearing dOnald tRump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What about the children you put in cages? #WeWillNeverForgetTheChildren. You're an evil man #45. You can't even return these children to their parents because you never documented it. Karma,,,what goes around comes around<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So did the Democrats in Virginia, its all #Blue now. #Bluewave2020,,,#MoreBlueComing2020 #VoteBlueNoMatterWho #QuidProQuotrumpGottaGo #BlueTsunami<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣 please stop with this fake ish,,,you are so scared of losing and going to jail that you'll say anything. You're going to jail when all is said and done. Can't wait to see you go!!!!! #SDNY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Why should they be investigated?You're the one who got busted and who got caught up in criminal activities, corruption and fake propaganda. You really really should resign to spare yourself with what's to come.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dvillella @realDonaldTrump #MoscowMitchIsNext,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Strandjunker Talk about corruption,,,✋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You mean your "Summary" of the transcript,,,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SallyDeal4 @GreggJarrett Oops,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump We saw it,,,it was half and half. The LSU win and the touchdowns were louder,,,,,,,lots  and lot of boos though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glamelegance @realDonaldTrump And he knows he doesn't read, but he's advertising for him. I call that benefiting financially and according to his #45 its a crime. The nerve to go after Hunter Biden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Not.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump First of all if you were the genius you claim to be you would know how the process works. BTW your so called transcript is not verbatim,,,it is a summary of notes from different people who were in on the call. Stop lying to your base. Its a SUMMARY,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joncoopertweets Yaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyy,,,Bye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoWay7790 @DonaldJTrumpJr I'm confused,,,why would the son of an illegitimate president have to write a book begging daddy donnie to love him? This appears very stupid of jr to beg for his father's love,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrumpWarRoom @realDonaldTrump Not,,,you want black American votes. You are not fooling anybody, you make promises to get what you want and once you get it you say screw black people. You lie like a dog, so much for winning,  Mexico paying for the wall, and all this so call winning. You lost and its costing 2M<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Msdesignerlady @mkraju Exactly,,,,,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You know you need russia to help you win. This is why you and your cronies are putting in overtime to defraud Ukraine. Let's see if you can win all by yourself. BTW you are making it hard for yourself. We're watching you!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Oh please,,,you're a crook<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amy_Siskind @RudyGiuliani Seems right to me.......<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani What about you #giulianibehindbars? Is what people are saying about you a farce or a hoax? This is not a frame up and not a hoax as in the russia investigation. Stay lawyered up. You're gonna need them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dvillella @realDonaldTrump All of them,,,,some have never judged any cases<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irishson1916 @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Love this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Deb4Democracy @dcexaminer Absolutely,,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Twitter @FBIWFO what can be done about this. I also thought @Twitter was no longer allowing advertising political ads. Is @realDonaldTrump above the law on twitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@janahyde1 @Alyssa_Milano Amen,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano @kevinsullivan3 Okay Pastor Paula, did you ask #45 what happened to the babies/young children he separated from their parents? Where are they? You call the WH "holy ground".  Its a wholly mess. I use to like you,,,but praising a rapist, racist, liar and crook does not sit well with me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Yes indeed,  it surely has fired them up. They are sick of your rhetoric and they decided to put a Democrat in the Governor's house. Thank you #45.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @EddieRispone Maybe you should stay home,,,then again you should go. You rallied for Kentucky governor and he lost. Yeah you should go #lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump You're not funny,,,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😁😁😁😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Not if he depend on you,,,did you see what happened in Kentucky after you begged them to vote for you. Think again,,,he will get the same deal as the republican governor and so will you,,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amelia07689496 @nelsonwendella @realDonaldTrump Bot with 0 followers!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The nerve of you. Didn't you pardon criminals? Give me a break already. When are you gonna act like a president and do something  to help these so called failing cities instead of bashing them. Pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marklevinshow @realDonaldTrump One person<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It's being reported that Border walls are being cut. You know the saying "where there's a will, there's a way". I'm sure you know about that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So why are some Republicans saying you have done a quid pro quo and you're saying no? Soon all the Republicans will all say yes to "quid pro quo".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You gave Kushner the ok to arrest Khashoggi an American journalist who was subsequently arrested and killed? Despicable,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeHolly81 @JudgeJeanine @realDonaldTrump OMG ,,this is just as bad as trumps no quid pro quo. He was an American journalist and the nobody, kushner, gave permission to kill him. This is insane,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@roxeyinflorida @Mitch_Roschelle @realDonaldTrump 😅😅😅😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump From day 1 and before. That's because no one likes you!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Why do you keep saying it was "perfectly". It must be a big fat lie you're telling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Calm down. You will get all the information you need in record time,,,all you want to do is bash the whistleblower calling him names and trying to discredit him/her. Slow your roll captain, you will get all the info you need sooner than you think ,,,#BlueWave2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarReNaples @beyondpartisan @thedailybeast @TheRickWilson I'm glad I'm not a bot. 100% human<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar They may have come forth. #45 is just upset he doesn't know who they are,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngelaBelcamino @mmpadellan He is scheming what his next move is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar Any time you have to say the phone call was "perfect" a thousand times means you want people who don't read to believe you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMarkMeadows @realDonaldTrump The aid was released in September though. The reason it was released is the whistleblower came forth about the call and #45 got scared and said he had a transcript and he released it,,,but he vetted it and took out key points and got busted. #ImpeachTrump #Bluewave2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thedailybeast @TheRickWilson He knows he's in deep. The expression on his face tells it all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RetiredCo857 @NoWay7790 @IvankaTrump Disgusting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What's wrong,,,you don't want to live on Barak Obama Avenue? 😅😅😅😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It appears you're running from something but the SDNY knows where to find you. Don't change your address thinking you can get away with any crimes because it won't ,,,,make a difference. You committed crimes while you lived in NY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr That is a lie #MoscowMitch,,,why are you blocking the 400 bills on your desk. You haven't signed  anything since 2016. You're a fake senator that will do whatever tRump tells you to<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/C6xPV8wsmp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump And finally,,,we got the witch 🧹🧹 #VoteBlueNoMatterWho #QuidProQuotRumpgottago #Bluewave2020 #VoteBlue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What for? It been changed and some of the information is missing. You really think you are very smart. You're not and every time you break the law you get caught. So much for a stable genius<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@okkie48 This is great news. I cannot for the life of me understand why these so called professionals, congressman/Senators, are giving up their lives and whatever integrity they have to protect this crook #45<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glamelegance @realDonaldTrump No,,,not my President<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@okkie48 @realDonaldTrump #45 is a traitor. I can only imagine how much classified security information #45 leaked to his pal putin. Since he is so interested in corruption someone needs to investigate him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Some did find something wrong with it, like cutting parts of the phone call off the transcript. You think you're slick but you get caught all the time. #Dodobirddummy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr That will never happen. We know who and what you stand for and its not America. Tell #MoscowMitch to authorize the bills on his desk. Why is he holding them hostage. We will get them passed when the Democrats take your office and #MoscowMitchs seat. Bye,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngelaBelcamino @realDonaldTrump I vote Blue all the time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @SteveDoocy @foxandfriends Nooo,,,the rethuglicans has been asking for a vote since the inquiry started. Can't even get lie straight,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepLeeZeldin This ish is laughable,🤣🤣🤣😁😁😁😅😅😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepJeffDuncan @realDonaldTrump So the 47 GOP congressman are so dumb that they don't understand what is being said. Why are they in the closed door meeting? Gym Jordan look like the big bad wolf, he was so angry at what he heard. I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow the house down,,,,🐺🐺😅😅😅😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepDougCollins @realDonaldTrump Isn't this inquiry an investigation? What are you saying? You can't find anyone guilty without an investigation. Sounds like you don't want America to hear the truth like  missing information from the phone call, i.e. #45 saying I have tapes etc.........<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMattGaetz @realDonaldTrump You took the oath to serve the people of America and to protect the constitution. How do you know he's innocent. Do you think he is gonna give you a job when  #45 leave office and you are voted out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMattGaetz @realDonaldTrump So ignorant,,,how do you know he's innocent? Better protect yourself because when he loses, he will throw you under the bus in a heartbeat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMarkMeadows @realDonaldTrump I think Americans already see through this debacle of the GOP. You think people don't know how an investigation is handled. I just can't understand why you so called scholars don't get it. But then again when I see you all screaming like preschoolers, I do understand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SallyDeal4 @realDonaldTrump Thank you,,,all I can say is WOW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Stop saying it was a perfect call darn it. If it was so perfect you wouldn't have to say it a thousand times. Shut up!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump GM closed the plant in Ohio. You told them not to worry and don't sell their homes. Now the automaker is gone and many people have left Lordestown. When will you start building the new plant you promised? You always brag about winning so when and what are you going to do #45?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump #45 you corrupted and destroyed  the integrity of the GOP. Face it dude, you're a mess and eventually, at least, 25 GOPers will decide for themselves whether to lose their position to save you. I doubt they save you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You say and do anything you want because you think you're above the law. Well there's plenty people who don't agree you had a perfect call. We can read you know. Btw you're the one who released the transcript now deal with it. You pressured Zelensky. #LOCKHIMUP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bpjohnson5576 @realDonaldTrump @TigerWoods For Real,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump got booed at a World Series game in Washington DC. Tell me how it felt to hear "Lock Him Up" directed at you. This is an indication that what goes around comes around. The World Series? Btw why didn't you take your son to the game?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VP @realDonaldTrump I thought ISIS was defeated ,,, Liars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoarseWisperer Yup,,,,Lock Him Up!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So why are you tweeting it. Shouldn't classified information stay in the oval office until it's confirmed. So unpresidential of you. You're still going to jail no matter what, when or how you look at it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshtpm It won't be the first recession we dealt with<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You better believe if they feel they need him/her, there will be testimony. Its not they don't want the whistleblower, they just don't need the whistleblower at this time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Funny we haven't heard of you celebrating your anniversary since you've been in the WH.,,,I wonder why<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump No one wants to work with you. They might end up in jail,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nelsonwendella @realDonaldTrump Absolutely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump How much do you owe the government or the different states you owe monies. You should pay your own debts before you tweet about someone else's conditions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump How do you know what Kamala Harris is going to do? Is that the Sudafed or Adderall talking for you,,,you embarrass America more and more every single day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JRehling @realDonaldTrump Hmmmm,,,total giveaway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kathatestrump @realDonaldTrump He needs to slow down on his dosage,,,he looks like he's taking too much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What are you gonna do if there is no Adderall?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StanleyLewis09 @joelockhart @realDonaldTrump Absolutely,,,this is why he's fighting so hard to stay in office.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dvillella @realDonaldTrump Love this 😁😁😁🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pmjatlanta @B52Malmet @AliVelshi Exactly. I'm surprised that people haven't caught on to him yet. They should bar him from coming unless he pays in advance. @realDonaldTrump is taking advantage of his position<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The whistleblower is right next to you. You just don't know who it is. It's not a Democrat, it's someone you talk to everyday. Now the book from the Anonymous writer is coming out. You should #Resign now before you are walked out by Federal Authorities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump If you did nothing wrong you should stop trying to vindicate yourself.  As long as you say things like no Quid Pro Quo and it was a Perfect Call you look guilty. Be quiet and let your Attorneys handle it,,,even though you're at the top of the list for "The Biggest Liar"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngelaBelcamino @realDonaldTrump I totally agree, but #45 is fighting like hell to stay in office because when he's out the Oval Office the Southern District of New York, SDNY, is coming for him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump No no no,,,not ending the investigation until you're found guilty. Btw, didn't Guiliani get paid by a company with "Fraud" in its name? Calm down donnie boy, the truth will expose all involved including you..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Mr Taylors testimony is all they need. Hahaha🤣🤣🤣. What's the matter? Does this make you nervous? Sounds like you're afraid of something that the GOP and all your cronies can't help you with,,,though 😁😁😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marklevinshow @realDonaldTrump And @realDonaldTrump deserves be treated worst than terrorists of a mass murderer. He separated young children from their parents, sold America out to putin, he is a traitor and most of all he is a liar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Give me a break. Is this a joke, a prank, what? You know darn well you don't read.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan @realDonaldTrump Trapping criminals is what the FBI does. Be careful @Jim_Jordan  because you could be next for hiding the sexual misconduct,,,oops!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump You mean what is #45 hiding. What is tRump afraid of. He's so corrupt and he's corrupted the entire GOP. What legacy will you have,,,and how will your grandchildren cope  knowing you supported a criminal. Man up dude,,,you know what's really up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@littledeekay Americans should have listened to he when she said #45 was a "putin puppet",,,now look at what is happening,,,I hope they listen in 2020 because he is still lying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepDougCollins @realDonaldTrump What are you afraid of? Do you really believe what you're saying,,,I  don't think so and I suspect the people who voted for you will feel the same way. You guys are unbelievable and you're afraid of something #45 has on you. Man up and stop being idiots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepLeeZeldin @realDonaldTrump Do you smoke? It shows,,,,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nelsonwendella @GaryCoby @realDonaldTrump Yaaaaaaayyyyyyyyy!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Acosta Tweet of the day. @realDonaldTrump should learn from these few words!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funder #ImpeachmentTaskForceRises<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmclghln @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Tell #MoscowMitch to sign one of the bills that are sitting on his desk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrDenaGrayson @GOP The GOP is acting like the gang of  WHMob-13. You mean to tell me the GOP will give up their careers to please a traitor in chief. He will turn on them in a heartbeat. I hope lawmakers hold everyone of them accountable. There is something really wrong about this type of behavior.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PalmerReport Colorado is the State with the most prisons. The city's name is Prison, Colorado. Maybe the wall is for him and to keep other prisoners from getting to him when he arrives. I can't wait for that day🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@New_Narrative Is this a Threat of war against any Democrats? Where is this information coming from?  You,,,are you inciting war in America? I'm just curious and want to know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@74Jill @mmpadellan Criminality and to protect his/her identity. I don't agree nor do I  disagree. I'm just gonna be neutral on this one because I cannot say what I really want to say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HKrassenstein Good to hear,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ISIS will wreak havoc around the world all because of you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someone's reading again. What @realDonaldTrump is reading does not come from his heart. How can you claim victory when you gave Turkey authorization to kill our Kurdish Allies families and  children. You betrayed our Allies, ISIS  is regrouping and more grief is coming,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @GOPChairwoman @ElissaSlotkin @realDonaldTrump Okay,,,we will send you packing too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman 18 of your colleagues. Not dozens. You just upset you got kicked out of the hearing last week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump The only value Ivanka, Jared, Donnie jr or Eric  brought to the table was access to the illegitimate #45. Corruption??? Which one of #45 children have Security Clearance. Why is Ivanka sitting in the Oval office. GOP  doesn't want to talk that corruption.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Case just starting to heat up. Why did AG Barr put the whistleblowers letter to the side and not release it to the proper authorities?  Do you and Barr think you're above the law? NOT,,,btw, wheres Guiliani? #SDNY coming for you and all your cronies 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Sitting somewhere close to you. You know darn well no Democrat could be the whistleblower. You don't allow Dems around you when you're making such calls as to Ukraine. Someone close to you is watching and listening to you break the law and they are telling on you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bpjohnson5576 @NASA @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @Astro_Christina @Astro_Jessica Exactly, why is his daughter sitting there. Where is his wife? She must be tired of his s**t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You don't have a choice but to find someplace else. You are not above the law #45<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You should not have started this so called important work. I know you see all he dead bodies of Kurds and you think you're doing something. I hear you got played by Turkey. Good for you. #PutinandTurkeySellout,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump trump tower is 2 blocks away from this same situation in New York City. What?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So why did you send 3000 troops to Saudi Arabia if you want our Soldiers out of the Middle East? Something fishy going on here!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump @SteveScalise You will say anything to keep from being rejected. Shame,,,shame,,,shame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Mitch Mulvaney said Quid Pro Quo. What do you say #45? The whole world is 🤣🤣🤣 at you!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ananavarro Hurricane Donald 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@happysnarkygal2 @debraggery All Americans are concerned with his mental health.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump President Obama is no longer president. How many have you killed. I saw a little girls life less body being held by her mother rebuking you for killing. A little innocent little baby girl. You're a monster wearing a "Red Tie"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump With @realDonaldTrump being the biggest Witch in the history of America!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyOstroy @realDonaldTrump With a Sharpie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Didn't Erdogan throw your letter in the garbage? This is how he feels about you,,,garbage bound.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nelsonwendella @realDonaldTrump Now he is the dumbest person to ever sit in the Oval Office #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #VoteBlueNoMatterWho #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteBlueToEndtRumpsReign I'm voting Blue,,,Are you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Common dude,,,120 days. You've got to be kidding me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Only 60 republicans stuck by you. Turkish FM says this is not a "Ceasefire" its just a a "Pause". One life lost is just as sacred as 1 million lives saved. Remember the woman who held her rebuking you for killing her,,,you are a pathetic person and not a leader at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr How many bill are you blocking, #MoscowMitch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What voters? The ones who believes your lies. Money is the root to all evil. Money can't buy everything,,,I don't care how much you raise. Make sure you pay your bills at these venues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump @SteveScalise And @SteveScalise  had his head down during Nancy Pelosi statement on #45s meltdown. Why? Is he shame of #45?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nelsonwendella @realDonaldTrump It will<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @VP @SecPompeo @RTErdogan For 120 hours? Really,,,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @VP @SecPompeo @RTErdogan You must be feeling guilty. You've killed people and more people will die with the resurgence of ISIS,,,your bloodshed in this region will forever live<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funder @MaryBurgessH Can Congress stop this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@callis_karen @funder With the bedbugs, mold and decaying structure, it should be cheaper. #45 is trying to make as many dollars as he can. I hope no one shows up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Me me me me,,,all you think about is yourself and money,,,traitor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump You looked like you were embarrassed when Pelosi was standing up to #45. Why did you put your head down? Was she telling the truth? I think so and she made the GOP and you look so stupid. 360 to 60 and you were one of the 60. Go somewhere and sit down with your head down,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nelsonwendella @realDonaldTrump Fantastic News,,,Bye Felicio<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump YOU DID NOT BUILD THE WALL #dummy. Can't you see the wall was already built<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump All you tweet about is money,,,is that all you have,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EarlyStart @AprilDRyan Rest in Peace Sir. Gone but never will he be forgotten,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad to hear Elijah Cummings is no longer with us. Praying for the family,,,we will miss this man of integrity, decency and respect. Rest in peace Sir. Gone but will be forgotten. We love you and thank you for all you have done for America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisMurphyCT #PalmerReport did you know this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyOstroy @realDonaldTrump You can tell everything about a man who can't sit up straight in a chair. #trump never sits back in a chair and cross his legs like his predecessors and most of his visitors. That's a scheming position that you use when all you do is LIE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Oh by the way this is an inquiry not an impeachment,,,use your dictionary  please<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Did you know there are pictures of you hanging with Guilianis arrested men 5 years ago? You sit on National TV and say you don't know these men. Let America see the server Ivanka is on and you're dreaming if you think the the GOP will take the house. You corrupted 2016 election<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisMurphyCT IMPEACH tRump now for lying all the time @CNN  @donlemon @ChrisCuomo @AC360 what do you say now @FoxNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PalmerReport Yesss, 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Pappiness @realDonaldTrump @seanspicer This should give Sarah Sanders something to think about,,,she was there longer than Spicer,,,period........<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends @SteveDucey @ainsleyearhardt What about the young American woman who was fatally shot in her own home by a Fort Worth Texas police officer? You just said America First 5 minutes ago. This is an indication that you don't think before you tweet. #RESIGNNOW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Liar,,,you mean tRump and his hotels first, right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CatintheHome @realDonaldTrump Absolutely,,,there is a special place for people  like this. I hope his base finally wakeup and see what he is doing to America. One day their children will be caught up and lost in this war because they supported a monster,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump Total distraction,,,for those who are dumb enough to believe him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@firstlastsecond @voxdotcom You never hear from her until it's time vote. What does she do anyway?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@outofcontroljb @realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EugJHawk @realDonaldTrump People should boycott her label,,,,,,,they charge you big $$$$ for things you can get with the a Target, Marshalls, HER etc label. Wake up ladies,,,everything they make is Made in China<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump People are dying because of your recklessness and betrayal and all you can think about is Hunter Biden. You are ruthless and a traitor. Hunter Biden is a better man than you anyday. All that matters to you is money of which you will never be able to spend. You're going to Jail,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump you started this mess because you have approximately 119 business interests in Turkey. You and your name and family will go down in history as shameful and greedy. Your upcoming family will regret being associated with the name Trump.  our young family<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jinxy_Minxy @austinsagehurl1 @PostTheOnion @BettyBowers @yashar I totally agree 💯%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealChr55685706 What kind of iisshh is this. I can't believe Twitter is allowing this to be seen by decent Americas. No,,,this is not a joke. Its sick and Twitter should take it down!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jinxy_Minxy @austinsagehurl1 @PostTheOnion @BettyBowers @yashar The person responsible for this video should have their account restricted forever. This is not funny and yes they should to be interviewed by the FBI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamSchiff @debraggery I knew this from day one. @realDonaldTrump has to have a major interest in Turkey in order to let them release ISIS again and let the Kurds population be annihilated. He is a very sinister person and he must be defeated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi This just out,,,Guilianis clients just arrested on Campaign Finance Charges. #45 and tRump jr met and had lunch with them. More to come<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump Times up #MoscowMitch,,,don't try and put this on the Democrats,,,Kentucky will vote you out!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump #TrumpPressuredUkraine,,,this is a distraction from the Ukraine scandal and you don't care about people being killed. You're a corrupt individual who should be investigated.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Your impeachment poll is steadily rising and this situation blocking Sondland will make it go even higher.  Can't wait to see you outside public office.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So why did you block him testifying to Congress. I assume, based on what you're tweeting, Sondland would have exonerated you,right.  But you hide the truth so your base would believe your lies. Time to go and let the white house air out. #TrumpPressuredUkraine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump This iisshh is so old. Please STOP Impeachment is trending now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan #TrumpPressuredUkraine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan My thoughts exactly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Can you explain what 5G is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyOstroy @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends No no no no. You're the one going crazy,,,look in the mirror.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Well #45 there is always a first and you're it. Doesn't it feel good to be first at something. AG Tish James is doing what AG's do. Unlike Barr running all over the world working for the illegitimate president. SDNY coming for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mrtimrock @realDonaldTrump I've never seen #45 and his wife this happy. Thank you President and  First Lady Obama. Wish you could come back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You will soon be known as "the blast from the past" 😁😁😁😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The endless wars are just starting with you. We are focusing on a giant picture to get you out of the Oval Office. America will go back to be more civilized once you're gone,,,Bye,,,president liddle hands<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump They are not interfering in the 2016 election, that was 3 years ago. But you and Russia interfered in the 2016 election. It's 2019 #trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump OMG,,,is the president of the United States calling someone an a**,,,you have stooped to the lowest of lows and it doesn't look good. You know you're gonna loose the election and you're slowly melting down. Sad,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bpjohnson5576 @realDonaldTrump Biden too!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funder @suekrek He needs to take pence with him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ByronYork You are a very frightened man who is afraid of running against Biden. You haven't said anything about Biden being corrupt until he entered the race. Now he is corrupt and you're investigating corruption,,,you should be investigating yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You are the one who got duped by Russia. They played you like a fiddle,,,and they are still playing you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Could it be you  don't understand what you're reading. You're reading it the way you want it to be interpreted but, we know what you said though,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You do not hold the title of investigator,,,you should use the fake title to do something positive for this country<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kaitlancollins Pence going down with tRump. He got caught and he knows he gotta go to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan Wishing Bernie Sanders a speedy recovery,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HillaryClinton @Kathatestrump Thank you. Americans must be vigilant about these issues because of what happened  in 2016. #45 is trying to prolong his time in office  so he won't be prosecuted in DSNY. But they are coming for him. #LockHimUp .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TravisAllen02 There's one not far from  me 😅😅😅😅😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joycehand7777 @RepMaxineWaters Exactly ,,, I hope and pray the Congress gets his but<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMaxineWaters ,,,agree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMaxineWaters This sounds like a plan to me. The entire GOP should be impeached. Oh, including pence,  pompeo, nunes, gym jordan the whole dam bunch who stand here and agrees with #45,,, start the impeachment inquiry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump If the phone call was so perfect, why do you keep reiterating it? Why does the call transcript and the written transcript  match so perfectly? If you're telling the truth own it and wait for the outcome. My outcome,,,#Impeachment,,, #YoureGoingToJail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump #LiarInChief ,,,you did it and you hurt America everyday with your criminality and your racist rhetoric<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StewardshipAmer @realDonaldTrump @RepAdamSchiff So are your tweets,,,BOT,,,Liar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Maybe Adam Schiff should read the call. I hear the call and the transcript are verbatim,,,you know you said it. Then again you say so much crap that you don't remember you said it.  Read transcript and call compare them,,, btw SOS pompeo is a liar too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nelsonwendella @realDonaldTrump I love this,,,it should replace the tower on Barack Obama Blvd,,,New York City #lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Your language is so unwelcoming of a so call president,,,but coming from you we understand how upset you are for being impeached.  My grandma use to say,,,you make your bed hard,,,you lay in it and we know how much you like gold. Prison beds are just as hard though,,,,😁😁😁😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump,,,Why do you you insist on bashing people of America? True the day you entered office you should have been impeached, it was an illegal win and you lost the popular vote. You should calm down,,,this should teach you how not to be so corrupt!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi Happy Birthday President Carter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mea_mark @AuthorKimberley I totally agree with you,,,he needs to be stopped now!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You are the most  delusional, unhinged out of control person I have seen in all my years. You need to stop with the petty tweets let this situation play itself out. You're a stable genius right? Twitter can't win this war for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Your bad tweets are no longer distractions, the reveal a very scared man trying anything to help his case. You're done #45. You have gotten away with criminality for many years. Time to go come to SDNY and face the music,,,  https://t.co/EBe6dqmF9h<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump We don't want to impeach this,,, we want to impeach you,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewsCorpse Gym Jordan does not want #45 gone,,,he is trying to keep the media story off of his involvement in the sexual harassment he has been implemented in. He is either dumb or just plain  stupid, both equal assessments,,,either way he has lost his mind!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump 😂😂😂😂😂 You're screwed 😂😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Sorry #45 the case just started. Not all of your base believe the case is closed. They are now beginning to realize you screwed yourself up and they are not with it. #ByetRump #Resigb #VoteBlueNoMatterWho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Why don't you stop this iisshh,,,All news is not fake with a few exceptions created by you, "THE CENTRAL PARK FIVE AND THE ONES ABOUT PRESIDENT OBAMA. You need to stop and face the music,,,you're a liar period,,,and you're mad because you did it to yourself,,,Grow Up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewsCorpse @realDonaldTrump You are the "Savage" for being stupid enough to release the information that incriminated you. But #45 we appreciate this information and we look forward to getting more,,,,,,,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glamelegance @realDonaldTrump Yes, and you can see it all over the face of @realDonaldTrump. Every time he is implicated in a scandal he calls it "fake news" or "witch hunt". This is the best fake news, witch hunt I've seen since 1/20/2016. #ImpeachTrumpNow  #VoteBlueNoMatterWho #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Hey donnie boy,,,you fit the "extremely rare" category perfectly,,,that is why you're being investigated for impeachment. By the way, you have been the top news story every day since January 20, 2016. A smart man would stay out of the news and act like a president should act<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mauigirl52 @realDonaldTrump @WashTimes @FoxNews Exactly,,,had he remembered what he said he would have known the call was not a perfect call.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mauigirl52 @realDonaldTrump @WashTimes @FoxNews @realdonaldtrump did not read the transcript or the call before he released it,,,now he's trying blame everyone else for his stupidity. So much for being a stable genius,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @WashTimes @FoxNews Ok enough already,,,President Obama is no longer occupying the oval office,,,when are you gonna stop blaming him for your mishaps. The situation you're in, you did to yourself by thinking you are above the law and giving the Dems evidence for you impeachment,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is an indication that @realDonaldTrump does not read. He didn't know he was telling on himself,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimMYoung4 @dvillella @realDonaldTrump is desperate,,,he will do anything to distort the truth,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fras99 President Barack Obama, of course<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Another one of your Lies,,,Dems are now known as the Impeach Trump Party,,,they did a whole lot and more to come,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump If this call was so "perfect" why are you saying fake news or another hoax.,,,You can't say things then try to change what you said, its on video, it is written and it's recorded in your voice. So much for exposing yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You are the swamp @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarySanchez12 @TheRynheart Especially if its #RudyGiuliani ,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1happyphantom @ProudResister He released this nightmare.  The transcript and the cell phone documents are his own words and were released by him. I hope and pray it sticks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonfavs @Saintsswimmom @realDonaldTrump really believes he is a dictator,,,this is one of the reasons he requires total loyalty to work for him. But the people accepting his loyalty will go down with him and they will be looked at as traitors for the rest of their lives,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a must read. @realDonaldTrump is in it up to his ears,,,Bolton knows the whole story,,,Looking forward to his Book<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @CNN You used "discribing" as a word. DISCRIBING IS NOT A WORD,,,#dodobird,,, you should use your dictionary more often. Also look up the difference between a Hyphen and Apostrophe. It shows which is which and when to use them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani is taking the spotlight from @realDonaldTrump. He said he is the hero but he is actually a zero. He is doing exactly what #45 want and he has lost all credibility as Americas Mayor,,, he should receive the "Hero to Zero" award<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRynheart Oh #Ukrainegate is a scandal? I thought it was a perfect call<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan Exactly,,,we will hang in there until this tyrant is gone,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VicStoddard @ProudResister @HillaryClinton I hope America has learned its lesson regarding Election Fraud and that it never happens again!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyannePolls It is especially if the person being impeached is a corrupt racist, rapist, traitor who is trying to cover up his wrong doing as #45 is. Are you one of the people the #Whistleblower is going to name @KellyannePolls?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You created #Ukrainegate now deal with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 @djrothkopf This Country's leaders are so corrupt that its sickening. We already know about #MoscowMitch n Lindsey Grahams connection to Russia. I wonder what other GOPer will be tied to the NRA. Is this making America great again or making greedy men richer,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Yes they can. They just know not to ask for favors like your dumba** did. These are great lessons for future Presidents not to EVER ask for favors from foreign leaders to get reelected and to receive funds already approved for them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The #Whistleblower seems to have you freaking out. You committed Treason and your a traitor soon you will serve two terms,,,one in Washington prison and one in New York State prison. Your loyalists Giuliani and Barr will soon join you!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You are a DO NOTHING #45 and as long as #MoscowMitch is majority leader nothing will ever get done. Democrats need to #FlushTheWhiteHouse of all the venom that currently occupy it. Too many snakes there,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump No scam,,,this is #trumpwatergate2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You constantly blame Democrats for your shortfalls. Not one Democrat was in the office with you when you were on the phone with Zelensky. All news about you is not  fake nor is it a witch hunt. Own it,,,you did it. Its time to accept it and move out of the Oval office<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews You did it, you finally made "History". You call every story about you fake news, you use 'no collusion, no obstruction all the time. I can't wait to hear the Whistleblowers version of the truth.  I hope he/she gives every persons name involved in this coverup,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You are dreaming if you think you and your party will win 2020 in a landslide ,,,this phone call has doomed your reelection. The USA does not want a criminal leader. #ResignNow  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #VoteBlueNoMatterWho2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It appears the Witch (#45) has been  caught asking a foreign leader "do you a favor", trying to cover it  up,,,calling the whistleblower "scum", and saying its fake news. Nothing fake about this news. You have defeated yourself by thinking you are above the law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Why do you think you are under siege? The country is under siege since you took office....We wish you would just #Resign now and save this country from your bs,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You wish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like this wall can be climbed,,, @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @BretBaier You got busted,,,asking a foreign leader to investigate Biden,,,Do you think you can stand on 5th and shoot someone and get away with it now? You are not above the law. I'd like you to do us a favor  #RESIGN #VoteBlueNoMatterWho<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump is shaming the USA once again with his non enthusiastic speech he is reading to the leaders at the United Nations. Looks like he has had too much "ADDERALL". And, he is orange as hell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bill_Maxwell_ #LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjjw2 @MaddowBlog We do not want an edited transcript, we want the actual call,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaddowBlog @Jeannie70264082 Exactly,,,Barr will do to this transcript the same thing he did to the Mueller report. #ImpeachBarr and the GOPers who support what @realDonaldTrump Is doing to America,  #CountryFirst,,, not #45<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StewardshipAmer @realDonaldTrump Bot,,,,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Yeah,,,you wish. You're under 40%. How the hell you get past 50%,,,this is another one of your 12,000+ lies. Your approval rating has never ever been in the 50's. You're not only a liar but you're the biggest joke,,,#Resign and save yourself the humility of being voted out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @MadanMo73308910 @FoxNews It doesn't matter what you, @FoxNews or anyone else say, you cannot win without cheating. You know the whistleblower and you definitely know it is a GOPer which is why you or your cronies won't release the call or the transcript. You're done,,,your reign is over, bye Dumbo!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GregShugar @senatemajldr #MoscowMitch is up for reelection,,,he will do and say anything to keep his position.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pressure on the Ukraine leader. Why did you send Giuliani to start the investigation, which he failed so #45 called to and tried pressure him,,,but he go caught.... #VoteBlueNoMatterWho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only way @realDonaldTrump can win reelection is by Cheating and lying to his base,,,the reason he is starting to look older than Biden is he got caught. Someone close enough to  him (Gop) ratted him out. Now he is trying to clean it up by saying he didn't put,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Please stop,,,you messed up and now your blaming Biden and the Democrats. You already know who your Whistleblower is. Who can sit with you in the Oval office while you're on phone. Only a GOPer who is tired of your mess and they are calling you out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Why????? This really makes no sense. But we've gotten use to #45 not making any sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewsCorpse @realDonaldTrump @nytimes @MZHemingway @MediaBuzzFNC This video depicts a desperate man loosing his mind in order to take his opponent down. You are using headline to make a point. Why not release the whistleblowers memo to Congress and the truth will come out. But you're scared the truth will be told<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump America should sue you for being a illegitimate #45 for all you are worth and the taxpayers money that you are illegally using,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mexican congressman climbs U.S. border fence to illustrate that Trump's wall is 'totally absurd'  - ABC News -  via @ABC  https://t.co/1DSIUNYS0q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You also said you didn't remember the phone call, but you then said it was a perfectly great conversation. This tells America that you do know who the whistleblower is and you are terrified. Will we see another firing soon? I bet we will,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Someone in your own party is the culprit and you are ticked off which is why Barr and the GOP won't release the report. But one day while you're sitting in jail, or sooner, America will find out who you really are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You said it was a Partisan but you don't know who. Hmmm,,,,what Democrat is sitting in the Oval office while you're on the phone talking to foreign leaders? None,,,I would guess you know who it is and as usual you're blaming Democrats,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fras99 President Obama,,,#45 mentions his name more than he has mentioned his wifes name in the last 33 1/2 months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump If there was nothing said wrong then why  not release the statement to Congress,,,this indicates that the "Whistleblowers" statement is true and you got busted promising a foreign leader a favor if they lie on Biden and his son Hunter,,,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So what have you done for America then tax cut for the 1%, the jobs for American people with no benefits and who have to work 2 &amp; 3 jobs to makes ends meet, take money from military families for education and infrastructure and fired people who are not loyal to you,,,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PackersFavreFan @Melissa26922212 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump #45 didn't reduce taxes for the average Americans, only 1%. Trump is riding Obamas bring back from a recession that a Republican President created. It's not here yet but wait and see. Our deficit is very high and he's using funds from different entities to fund taxes for the rich<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @SteveHiltonx Large Companies are laying people off and leaving America too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @SteveHiltonx Well thanks you for letting us know @45 is NOT tweeting this mess. There are mass shootings going on, a hurricane in route to the US, a fire on a boat with 34 people missing and all you can talk about is his fake inflated job numbers and his so called wins? Such a disgrace,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You're jealous of Amazon owner, Bezos. You will never have his smarts to start a business and win. You are a crook and you're jealous of President Obama too. You'll never be equally match to either one of these "Successful Gentleman".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kwil0944 @glamelegance @realDonaldTrump #45 does not know what priorities mean!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glamelegance @realDonaldTrump And some Americans call that leadership attacking his own country. That's not making America great again,,,it is making you look like a fool and the fact that you don't care about Americans in general,,,only the 1%. What about  the other 99% @realDonaldTrump?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Melissa26922212 @realDonaldTrump 😅😅😅😅🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I wonder why,,,YOU, of course<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cwyyell @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/G4LuwC1qPi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It's only bad because of you and your racist rhetoric, only caring for the rich and hating brown/black people of all nationalities. You will never eliminate the people who built this already great country. #RESIGN,,,you should go where you will be king and are chosen,,,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Yeah right,,,you weren't saying this when your properties were not in the path of the hurricane. Now you're worried. Such a pathetic person to call the leader of America. You were not saying this when Dorian was headed to Puerto Rico. God has a way of getting your attention..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why. @realDonaldTrump is monitoring thr hurricane. He is worried about "HIS" properties not people in America,,,this includer Puerto Rico  Trump properties Doral, Mar-a-Lago potentially in Hurricane Dorian's path  https://t.co/d38SDI4TRJ via @msnbc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Not,,,if you're tweeting maga!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Is it going toward Mar-a-Lago<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Maybe if you apologize others will apologize. The kids locked in cages, the names you call people, the nasty things you said about Puerto Rico and the things you do and say in general, these are some of things you should apologize for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Every word coming from your mouth is a lie and you embarrass yourself. You don't need any help embarrassing yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrenzieK @MFantfant @realDonaldTrump @OANN 😂😂😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The question is, Will You Pardon Them if they break the law?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You're always calling people names,,,you canceled your trip because the PM made a statement using the word "abzurd". I wonder if you even know what absurd mean. You are a disgrace to America and you should step down now that we know about where your money came from.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StewardshipAmer @realDonaldTrump @EmmanuelMacron You need to get on your Knees and God to forgive you for making the biggest mistake saying tRump cares about all Americans and you knowing its a lieYour tax break must be huge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @EmmanuelMacron We'll find out the truth when the summit is over,,,you  could be lying again #Liarinchief<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StewardshipAmer @realDonaldTrump Wrong again,,,its people who pretend to love God like you that despise Americans. Gods love is not how much silver, gold and the mighty dollar you have or how much money you save in taxes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You are always trying to tell people how to do things and you can't do anything yourself,,,No one is listening to you anymore and soon the GOPers will turn against you too!!! #BLUEWAVE2020 #VoteBlueNoMatterWho2020 #dumptRump2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump This is another distraction from what this unstable man is doing. @realDonaldTrump is "EXTREMELY"   jealous of President Obama's Legacy. He will never equal the Integrity of President Obama. That's why he blames him for all his losses. Jealously causes instability !!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@richstanislaw @AMVETSHQ I don't really think he knows what respect is @richstanislaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Too bad Israel can't vote for him. No disrespect to Israel, but #45 is no king in the USA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He call people names, talk about people wives, disrespect women and you tell me he can't take the word absurd. I guarantee he does not know how "absurd" he look and sound and his mental stability, in my opinion, is in need of help. Lord help us now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#45 is upset because PM of Denmark used the word "absurd" which he said disrespects the United Stated but he can call parts of Africa "Shithole countries". What is happening to the United States under his unstable racist reign. It's time to impeach this fool now,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump He says the same thing over and over again just like you. Talking loud and saying nothing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChiefsHeadCoach @kaitlancollins Exactly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kaitlancollins First of all why say that to anybody.  Supporter or not. He's fat, face getting wrinkle, nose running with cotton candy hair. But he wears a toupee when he goes out to these rallies. He should look in the mirror, he can't hide from hiself and who he is.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Not today donnie!!!  "LOL"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StewardshipAmer @realDonaldTrump Wait, whose paying you? The Dow just today, is  down 800 points today and you're praising him?????? This so called extraordinary negotiator is losing and a recession is looming. You must be getting big money if this doesn't affect you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I have never in my lifetime seen a real President of the US ask the leader of another country, on twitter, for a personal meeting. President Xi is gonna laugh you right out of the Oval Office. That market plunge is getting to you, huh.TOO BA,,, What goes around, comes around<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itzaclareday @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump @Varneyco I totally agree with you. Knowing that he'll loose, he will destroy America and put us in a bad position. But, America always bounce back and we'll be better than ever before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @Varneyco @FoxBusiness You said the tariffs would not hurt America. Now you decided to stop tariffs until December to spare higher prices to consumers for Christmas. Another lie that it won't affect consumers. You're trade war is gonna hurt America far worse than you say. Stop lying so much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Where is the money coming from into the US and what are you doing with the money.  Look at the stock market. Its only gonna get worse when the recession hits. Tell your base the truth. You're a liar and 70% of Americans know this, even your base!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CariniGambarini @thehowie @Comey Absolutely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @CNN You are bad for America. Always tweeting about yourself and blaming it on others,,, TRUMP is BAD for America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenniWrenB @JeffreyGuterman You took the words right out of my tweet. I would have done the same thing to get away from this dummy too!!!#lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You should put your name where  The New York Times is. You just spelled  out who  you are and what you're doing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr The world is watching you too #MoscowMitch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I thought you were on vacation. Usually when people take vacation they spend time with their wives not get on twitter and call someone elses wife psycho. Especially not the illegitimate POTUS or does he? Hmmmm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoanieReb @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump 😀😀😀😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump What 12 people donating 1 million each. That much support is overwhelming<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @nytimes Liar liar,,,this was a photo op instead of being about victims. That's why they didn't want to see you,,,you'd probably make them sicker.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump No DOTARD, the press is way more accurate than you think.The Media reports honest news unlike Tucker Carlson who is now on an unplanned vacation after saying white supremacy is a hoax,,,and that statement is fake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The only real work you do is watch tv, use your Twitter finger all day, cause disruption around the world, lie, brag about yourself, trying  to destroy America and mainly kissing up to putin and kim jong un. I don't call that work<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You probably did see numerous patients, none of the shooting victims wanted to see you,,,the only one from the tragedy you saw was a baby who doesn't know your rhetoric caused him to be without parents<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FLOTUS @POTUS Do you realize this child lost his parents because of your husbands racist rhetoric and you're holding him smiling and he's giving a thumbs up. Are you gonna adopt him? He has no parents and no one to take care of him but the government<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stucam7771 I would never have my grandchild or, whatever relationship this child is to these people, see or be near the tRumps. His non policies are why this child is parentless,,,bad move #IJS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Goss30Goss Thank you #AndrewGross. You are 100% right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @OANN He was doing what you wanted him to do. He followed you and agreed with your rhetoric and racist tweets. Now you're trying to blame Democrats who has nothing to do with this. You are a pitiful man who will do and say anything (lies) to get votes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clairecmc Now that these people are no longer able to work, who will be processing the food. Will there be a shortage? Will the prices of food go up. Did dummy #45 think of this? Who will fulfill these positions. What is America coming to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarinaEmberly @nursegalmom @stucam7771 That's what I thought<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I wonder why you or your staff did not tweet your comments on crowd size or Beto O'Rourkes crowd size. Someone you claim to have so much respect for you did because they tweeted the video. The position of the president is not about you but about America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump But you comments were about how big your crowd was. What about the injured victims you were suppose to see. They rejected you so you come home bashing Americans. You should have stayed home with your running nose. What no tissue. You look worse now than before!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kokomothegreat @DHumanservices I'm about to lose my donations from Russia so I'll do or say anything to keep it going. Please, Russia  please don't cut me off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Time out dude. Every President that sat in the Oval office was investigated just like you. You should know,,,you did it President Obama.  Oh, I see,,,Donnie boy had a bad day today,,,not going so well huh!!!!    WE KNOW,,, #VOTEBLUE2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Why? What's the purpose of doing that. Oh, did you leave your toupee on Air Force One because your hair looked like cotton candy when you left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You are so fake. Did you ask anybody to vote for you? And you better believe El Paso doesn't love you. You're the biggest liar to walk on this earth and the world knows it!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Photo session for #45<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Strandjunker I knew they were some how connected,,,#45 is the biggest crook and America better watch tRump. He is a crook<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump That's fantastic. The deficit should be covered,,,right? We no longer have a deficit of 1.2 trillion dollars,,,right? Or is this another one of your fake nu.ber stories that is full of crap? Which one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Name one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RRspunkypete @realDonaldTrump Yes indeed he did. He is so embarrassing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump If billions and billions of dollars are coming in, why is the deficit still at an all time high. Where is the money going? #DividerandChief, #illegitimatePOTUS, #Russianpuppet, #Criminal, #Rapist #RacistDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr Well pass the darn gun law #HR8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @kilmeade @foxandfriends 20 mass shootings in 2019,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump @kilmeade @foxandfriends He knew President Obama would have wiped his but out. At least he know who to pick fights with. He didn't win this election, he bought it with the help of Russia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mzceetee @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump @kilmeade @foxandfriends Exactly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @kilmeade @foxandfriends President Obama never incited violence like you calling people of color murderers, rapist, traffickers, bringing drugs, crime and calling them invaders. There has been 20 mass shootings under your administration and you invaded the White House with help from Russia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProudResister @senatemajldr @GOP This is what #MoscowMitch and the GOP family does. They stoop to the lowest level of mankind. They are so petty!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @Google So what is Russia doing? Are you following Russia to see that they are still interfering with our elections and posting ads for fake protest,,,false advertisements ect.. That's who we're interested in. This is a Complete Distraction from what you and your campaign is doing!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs The way you're going after Google is the way you should be going after Russia who hacked our electoral system. You're going after Google for personal gain. The presidency position is not about you,,,it about our Country<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs That's why the market tanked last week and started this week down almost 800 points and like you said nobody did this but the #45. Tariffs,,,that's right,,,Tariffs. Sounds like the message was edited<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JFKucinich @mindyfinn He is the one with the mental problem!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NanaTamara21 @MashiedNp We will see if he loses voters without shooting someone in the "middle of 5th Avenue",,,I think he will<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ananavarro His support comes from them,,,that's why. He thinks the white supremacist domestic terrorism is going to help him win. But,,,the #BLUEWAVE that came during the midterm election is coming bigger and stronger like never before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Did you go to El Paso or Ohio. Have you reached out to any of the families who lost loved ones. No,,,you were too busy playing golf and now you want to talk about immigration reform. Do something about Gun Reform,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Immigration reform? People lost their lives to home grown terrorists and you want immigration reform. I say we need white supremacy reform, gun reform and you out of the White House reform so we can get back to normal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The Media is doing their job,,,reporting your crimes and evil doings, i.e. racism, rape, fraud, money laundering, russia. They only tell the truth and they can back it up. Thank God for the Media. You're just mad.....Too Bad🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump Can you explain how he is standing up for America when everything he does for this country is tearing it down and dividing its people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You are a major violation. Everything you say and do is a major violation. Don't  worry your time is almost up. Why don't you just resign. #DividerInChief #bluetsumani2020, #Voteblue2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MabonTail @Richiericher1 I hope and pray the SDNY will not let him off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nelsonwendella @realDonaldTrump This is not mental illness nor does it have anything to do with health. #45 pushes his hate rhetoric against any nationality that is not his. He started with stopping Muslims and Mexico will pay for the wall. These people love tRump and his racist bs,,,its his fault<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump These people are doing this because you get in front of crowds and spew pure hatred. 291 mass domestic shootings in one year and you can't see that what you're doing has anything to do with it. Wrong,,,if you stand with people of America,,,then STOP it!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @USATODAY So how many times has this happened since you were illegally put in office. This has everything to do with your racist rhetoric. Can't wait to see you go. #VOTEBLUE2020 #BLUEWAVECOMING2020 #VOTEBLUENOMATTERWHO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@i24NEWS_EN @PastorDScott @ericlandskroner Sounds like this #45 supporter is looking for a job. But little does he know,,,he will never make it in the white house<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So if China is paying tens of billions of dollars to the US why is our deficit so high. Shouldn't some of the tens of billions reduce the deficit instead  of raising it,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FreakinLibs @ThankYouBob44 The Hands,,,the Hands<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse We know you're trying to build in North Korea. Great reason for kissing KJU's but. Just like you want to build in Moscow and Saudi Arabia. We see what you're doing #VOTEBLUENOMATTERWHO<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LeeHolly81 @bpjohnson5576 @realDonaldTrump They need to make an example of him in the justice. This is what we have to deal with in tRump era. Time to stop this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Have you been to the southern border to see the children, women and men you put in cages. Show some photos of you as illegitimate POTUS at the border since everything is a photo op for you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It takes a THIEF to know a THIEF. Stop telling on your self. Using charities to make money. You are a corrupt THIEF who stole billions from fake bankruptcies,  fake Charity endorsements, students in your fake university and your fake real estate classes. #FAKEPOTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr Exactly what you doing McConnell,,,putins destabilizing work. Blocking Election Security means you still want putins destabilizing work to help you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SallyDeal4 @realDonaldTrump Amen,,,I love it when a Bible verse can sum up the leaderships role in our country.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan @realDonaldTrump @PeteHegseth @foxandfriends This is why he is so unhinged and on a Twitter rampage,,,he and his family hates when America finds out who they are.

<|startoftext|>Hello @donlemo,,,happy Monday, on Saturday there was an incident in Brooklyn NY at Ole Timers Day,,,1 dead and 11 hurt. Why doesn't CNN bring attention to this incident like they did in California? This is news also<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BishopPMorton Amen Bishop,,,he is going to do and say anything negative because he knows his time is up. This is called distraction from his position in the Oval Office that his time is up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump He needs to get down on his knees and ask God to forgive him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Why do you use the word "STOLEN". Have you ever "stole " money. You are so easily using a word that has been associated with you. You should be careful with your terminology,,,it paints a picture of you, i.e. your "Charaties"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan Yes,,,we absolutely know who he is,,,#trump knows his time is up. That's why he is showing America who he is and it will get worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I know you don't believe Elijah Cummings is going to say thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@morten @realDonaldTrump Now that is embarrassing,,,you know your twitter rhetoric is teaching America not to vote for anyone like you again. What about the conditions at Mara largo? Rats, mildew, rust, unsafe food temperatures,,,you never talk about that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump No one plays the race card more than you. We have never had a sitting leader in the news everyday attacking his own country but won't condemn a foreign entity for attacking Americas democracy,,,#VOTEBLUE2020 #BLUEWAVECOMING #YOUAREGOINGTOJAIL #CRIMINALFIRSTFAMILY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You should stop wasting time trying to prove your innocence and start focusing on our country. No witch hunt and no hoax has ever had a leader as unhinged as you. You're proving yourself guilty with every negative thing you tweet and say. You are a disaster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @PeteHegseth @foxandfriends You are talking about yourself dividing this country. What is wrong with you anyway. Every since Mueller testified you are going Twitter crazy. You need to slow down old man,,,its bad for the heart<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalbertSwan @realDonaldTrump @RepCummings I bet they won't come to a African American neighborhood and do that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Speaking for yourself eh,,,you are describing what you're doing to this country and not just Baltimore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HMeemaw @realDonaldTrump @replouiegohmert 🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @replouiegohmert Still can't accept the fact that you are going to jail. You want to blame everybody but yourself.  But #45 the song says "you can't hide from yourself, look in the mirror, there you are. You're going to be a very lonely man in jail or out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @JesseBWatters You haven't done nothing on infrastructure, drug prices or trade either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Yes they do,,,hahaha,,,watch it donnie boy. Your days are numbered,,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump America will get back to business on January 20, 2020 without you representing us. We can't wait for you to go. Your base see right through you. You're grossly unhinged and near the end of your reign,,,,its just disgusting to see what you are doing,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Are you telling Barr to start another investigation,,,if you spent more time being #45 maybe people wouldn't dislike you. But all you do is disgrace our country and the citizens of our country. You're acting this way because you know you're gonna lose.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews is one station. What about the other polls and millions of Americans who don't agree with you and @FoxNews,,,,this is so dumb that you choose a propaganda network to boast about your ratings. I wonder do you ever read the replies you get on Twitter. I didn't think so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoryBooker are you running for President to represent America or are you running to discredit Biden.   You can't win just by discrediting your opponent. How are you gonna help America? What policies are you working on? Your ratings could change if you change,,,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Your policies are troubling. Economy is working for 1% of Americans. Most African American, Hispanic and Asians are working 2 n 3 jobs to make ends meet. Its not working for the majority. You're not helping by cutting food stamps n medications are still the same price,,,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We need a winner in the to run for Democratic seat. But if you win I will support you anyway but come up with a new plan and not focus on the old ones. This is 2019 not the 1960s or 1980s.  No one is perfect and everyone makes mistakes. #IAMVOTINGBLUE2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We love you guys but we need to move on and create better policy for the American people. We need a candidate to beat tRump not run against him and loose. Lay of VP Biden,,,he has the expertise and best chance to get America back on track. @CoryBooker @SenKamalaHarris<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Democrats want to win the election in 2020 now is not the time to bash and put their opponents down for issues from 40 years ago. If you have no chance of winning you need to back off of VP Biden and come up with your own plans @CoryBooker @SenKamalaHarris ,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You really think people are going to kiss your a** for the sake of your occupation of the White House. Your tariffs from China have been Exempted for your daughter. You are a criminal and you're going to jail #tRumpgoingtojailin2021,,, #VOTEBLUE2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @trish_regan No way you can read a 448 page report in 4 hours. You don't read. You can barely read from the teleprompter.  You are as guilty as Al Capone and you are running scared. #GUILTYGUILTYGUILTY #YOUAREGOINGTOJAIL #VOTEBLUE2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump CNN has 17 nominations,,,how many does @foxnews have,,,just asking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump One thing President Obama did not do was get on TV or Twitter telling America step by step what he did to take down our worst enemy. He just did it. That's what real Presidents do,,,not announce to the world what and when #VOTEBLUE2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acnewsitics @realDonaldTrump Because they're going to tell all and Mueller will tell the truth about Obstruction of Justice and the tRump campaign involvement!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Listen #45 you started this mess so deal with the results. All of America will be watching and your base will understand what Obstruction of Justice is, because you all in it.

<|startoftext|>@lenny_phil Bring me Hamberders,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump There you go again,,,in other countries business like Iran, Turkey, Mexico, UK etc. You need to focus on America and housing for homeless veterans, reuniting children with their biological parents and the safety of our streets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ida_skibenes @realDonaldTrump @SwedishPM He think money talks,,,but money is going to ruin his family, in the long run. The Bible says, "The root of all evil money"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stucam7771 He said "how stupid are Iowans, how stupid are the people in this country". So yes, I believe they think #45 has fixed the economy. They believe anything he says,,, #VOTEBLUE2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@owenawhaley Great job,,,keep this going<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is real,,,this is what @realDonaldTrump wants us to become. We need to get out and vote like never before to rid our country of this administration and their nonsense #VOTEBLUE2020 #BLUEWAVE2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@VP You are one pitiful Christian to lie to people about the conditions in tRumps concentration camps.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Sorry for typo,,,"what else"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump We were watching the Women Soccer Champions and you're bragging about what you won. We don't care. What didn't you win,,,the new set of lawyers for the census, Barr recusing himself. Whatelse????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan Acosta Is planning to cut funds to anti-sex trafficking of children by 80%. If this isn't an eye opener, and #45 is condoning it.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump This is awkward,,,the office you hold is not about you. It appears you like to take pictures but at the end of your reign, #November2020, all photos of you and your family should be archived or burned.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @nytimes Why don't you do some real presidential work and stop calling every news article, about you, fake news. Did you rape a 13 yr old, did you cheat on 3 wives, did you pay hush money to hoes, did you steal money from Charities? Nothing fake here. You're just mad that we know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You had the House and Senate for 2 1/2 yrs. You know you're a loser and you knew Democrats would win the House, which is when this wall became a national emergency. Why should they help you when McConnell doesn't help them. What goes around comes around<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRightMelissa @hogangidley45 @realDonaldTrump I pray God will awaken you to see through you &amp; #45s lies and deceit. July 4th is not celebrating only a Country. It is celebrating the men and women of this country who fought for our "Independence" not showing off fire our power. Good Christians don't follow evil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nelsonwendella @hogangidley45 @realDonaldTrump Wow,,,what a dog he truly is to threaten physical harm or death to a 13 year old just for a nut. Now we deal with this nut every day and he is threatening Countries with annihilation because his button is bigger than theirs,,,but he still got that mushroom,,,🐷 a** 🍄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Blame, blame, blame,,,you never blame McConnell for not passing bipartisan legislation,,,he is the one holding them up. Also, if you think the people in cages are living their best lives now, why don't you stop by,,,it really clean right??????<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You sound nervous. Joe Biden did add debt and guess what dumbo, Joe Biden was not a President. How can you compare him to all other Presidents when you are the one who increased our debt. Always blaming people for what you did.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Arapahoman15 @Patrici15767099 When he call a Coast Guard Commandant a commandad i turned it off. And i heard about the airports in 1812 yes, I'm glad i did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acnewsitics @realDonaldTrump What about "Commandad" instead of Commandant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The name calling is one of the main reasons you won't get elected in 2020. How would you like it if someone called you a name you don't like. Grow up #45. Not everyone likes you either,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@terri2uus Who ever wrote this speech is getting relieved of his job. What is @realDonaldTrump saying. This crowd of people  standing in the rain doesn't know what he is talking about,,,and neither does he,,,they were slow to applaud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimKilbane @StewardshipAmer @realDonaldTrump Thank you @JimKilbane<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Patrici15767099 Why does size of a crowd even matter. This is suppose to be a celebration of Independence and these Soldiers should be enjoying their lives at home with family and friends  not making one man look big. This is so dumb.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StewardshipAmer @realDonaldTrump So where was the airport in 1814??? I believe America deserves to know where was located. #45 should read his speeches and learn how to pronounce "Commandant" before he says "commandad".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoriBianco2 @peabodypress @GotArtAttitude Me too<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Isn't it gonna rain?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I will NOT answer your stupid question. Census is about the total amounts,,,not are you a citizen. Are you a citizen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulDEaton52 @realDonaldTrump Thank you for your service Sir,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You should change the laws,,,you are suppose to be the commander and chief and you can do anything, according to you. So do something yourself and fix your problem. You created it now fix it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I'm guessing the GOP could've fixed the border problems. If so, why didn't they fix it 2 years ago. Democrats only had the house since January. What was the GOP doing the 2 years the had the house? Eating hamberders,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You're baiting Iran and you are putting Americans in a bad position threatening Iran. So many young men and women will lose their lives because of your mouth and you don't care. Remember you said that "that's what you signed up for". You should be careful with your threats #45!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump This presidency is not about you!!! It is suppose to represent the people of America not just 1%. You are a show off man who thinks the country should praise you,,,Not,,,,, you're spending taxpayer dollars just like you blew you fathers money in 10 yrs. SAD,,,, #VOTEBLUE2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump These are not your people,,,you do not own America and the end of your reign will end probably sooner than you think. This is not a reality show where you can flaunt your power. This is real #45.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You are a sick person,,,forgetting what you said, thinking homelessness started 2 years ago. You don't even realize what a ticking time bomb you're creating at the border,,,The God I know is not pleased with you, your antics and your rhetoric and he will fix this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProudResister American people won't let that happen,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProudResister I won't watch either<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr I distinctly remember your father saying homelessness started 2 years ago during his reign, not knowing the difference between California being in the Western part of America and the Western Hemisphere though,,,now you with politicians gonna politician, instead of politic,,,Ugh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You punked out. 150 people is nothing compared to 911. What about the numerous people that died, jumping from the 110th because it was too hot. How does 150 people even compare?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan @realDonaldTrump Hey Gym the crisis is no soap, no toothpaste/ toothbrushes, no showers, no clean clothes,  no beds, no pampers/pullups for babies and +toddlers.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What the Newspapers do is report the NEWS. If it's about you than it is NEWS. Remember this is New York where you're from and they know all about your reputation. Sounds like you're mad because they're putting your business out there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump #45 do you know how many people died on 911 and you are worried about 150 people. They tried to sink one of our ships  in international waters.  And you are worried about 150 people. So dumb.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump No baby,,,cheating is your only hope. Your #45 punked out of going after Iran because 150 people would die. What about 911. How many Americans lost their lives and he is bothered about 150 people. Give me a break. He punked out period.........<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ECMcLaughlin @chrislhayes This is tRumps administration. All they care about is the amount of money they are saving/recieving, not paying taxes not about children who haven't bathed, brushed their teeth in weeks or changed their clothes and they what<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Are you worried about something #45?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You act like the Democrats had Congress for 2/12 years,,,why didn't you ask the GOP congress for what you wanted. You knew they wouldn't  give it to you and you knew the Democrats would win Congress so you could blame them. We will win the White House in 2020 too,,,watch<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You know the Democrats have only held Congress for 5+ months. What was GOP done in the 2years prior. This did not just happen at the border. Always blaming Democrats for your short falls. #DEALBRAKER #TANTRUMTHROWER #WALKINGOUTOFMEETINGS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump No #45,,,Democrats are not going to be bullied  by someone that doesn't have a plan<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Its going to get darker for you real soon. By the way I thought you was happy with Muellers report. What happened?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Isn't it true your son had a meeting with a Russian lady to supposedly talk about adoption, but it really was to get information on Hillary Clinton.  You knew what was going on and you didn't do anything to stop it. #RUSSIAINTERFERED #RESIGN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec You're a liar who does not understand what you read or hear. It clear and simple,,,based on the so called law #45 could not be indicted by Mueller. But he told Congress its up to them to take it from here. Mueller did not exonerate #45.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You're the witch that was caught in the witch hunt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GinnyMac55 My prayers are with you and your family<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I can't wait to hear what Special Counsel Mueller has to say. I know who will be watching @realDonaldTrump .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump How can you say God Bless America when on foreign land you publically disgrace a former American Vice President by agreeing with a murderous dictator. You don't mean it and you shouldn't say it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump This adds up for now,,,but what are you setting this Country in the future. I want you out of the Oval Office whether you're impeached or voted out. It is really time for you to go #Brokehontas<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chapolean @GREGORYSADLER @EdwardGaillard @realDonaldTrump He committed crimes according to the #SDNY and they are coming for him. He is scared to come back to New York because of his money laundering, bankruptcy, fraud and tax invasion to name a few....that's the major reason he is unhinged, deranged and wishing "Death" to Americans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Willall500 @GREGORYSADLER @EdwardGaillard @realDonaldTrump And the #SDNY roll up on his criminal but<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Ford is closing and people will be losing jobs,,, about 7,000. Go spend some time with your wife and family and stop tweeting "Death" to Democrats. You sound crazy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @AbeShinzo All you do is kiss up to these Leaders bcuz you think you are going to work with them in your future,,,but your future when you leave the Oval Office is with the #SDNY. You and your crime family will be in #jail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GinnyMac55 @realDonaldTrump @AbeShinzo This man doesn't care about #BeBest. All he does is talk and brag about himself. These Leaders don't really care about him. They are using him to get what they want for their country. #45 is a #BEWORST nut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GinnyMac55 @realDonaldTrump Yes, and I wonder when does he spend time with Melania. He acts so childish tweeting and calling people names, but gets angry when someone say something he doesn't like #smh #VOTEBLUE2020 #BLUETSUNAMI<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JesseBWatters @realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC @WattersWorld He needs to talk about the $800,000 he got from the Russian Oligarch too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Can we see your financials first. You go from calling @SpeakerPelosi names, to claiming you're a genius, to sending more forces to Iran and now you want to talk about healthcare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Their???? Calling people low IQ,,, What's your IQ#45<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChibiRaya @MuhammadKhursid @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump He is going after Iran and Iran does not want a war. Peace?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Pavox @realDonaldTrump Who,,,#Brokeahontas?????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Remember when you laughed it up with the Russian in the closed door Oval office after putting everyone out? Remember,,,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MadmanIke @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump #45 bankrupting businesses is part of his con game. He said "being a developer does not mean he developed anything". That's conman talk. It's all in his financial paperwork that he is so angry about America seeing. That's one of the reasons he is unhinged. He's a conman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump He needs to talk about something other than himself 😂 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan So are those young men interested in getting to the bottom of you and bs story that you claim weren't aware of,,,can't wait for you to be exposed<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ShanniJ9 @CNN Not many<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN How many have we caught #45 slurring words,  not being able to pronounce words and misspelling words. He is showing the American people his true colors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaketapper #45 will try and hurt America if he is voted out. Like Cohen said Individual 1 will not leave without a fight. #VOTEBLUE2020,,,#BLUETSUNAMI,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeTakei @Deanster1220 Don't leave out Lindsey Graham the one who got $800,000 from a russia businessman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Why don't you release the Mueller unredacted report so you can get back to work. Releasing millions of pages and not know what they are or what they say is irresponsible of you and could implicate you more than you ever expected!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr #45 might wish he never started this. More of his corruption will be exposed. We see what he is doing. Using his ag to boost his base with lies, be careful what you ask for individual 1,,, you may not like what will be exposed,why not release the unredacted Mueller report<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dictionaries do exist,,,oh, I forgot, you don't read with comprehension<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Bing Bing Bing man!!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So he can explain what "Obstruction' is to your base and to let them know who you really are. The real question is why you don't want him to testify? But don't worry. America will soon find out #LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @AbeShinzo What is wrong with your hair,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump When are you going to be a president and stop worrying about what people say about you.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You are the only person to occupy the Oval Office to make so much history. But the history that fits you perfectly is that you are the worst, lying, disrespectful child to sit in that chair. I hope and pray Biden or whoever, pick Michelle Obama as their VP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KaptainKobold @EdKrassen @GIowing0rb Hopefully before his term ends or until he is voted out in 2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@This_Actress @WarriorZoltar Men who commit rape or incest should be forced to get a vasectomy and pay child support for 99 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@asmoore @WarriorZoltar Yes,,,remember the physically young lady who got pregnant while in the hospital/rehab. Would a woman in that condition living in one of these States have to carry and keep the child or would the Government step in to take care of the child,,,just curious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WarriorZoltar @Natgcoh @ellabagh @JagbusAnne I wonder if there are women in these supposed  lawmakers families. Will they get exceptional treatment or will they have to carry it full term. Life doesn't give you the direction of where you'll end up. Smart people know this, why don't they know<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tribelaw Look at what happened in Ohio. You told Ohioans not to sell their homes. Now people are losing jobs, companies are closing and leaving our Country because of the tariffs. Where are the statistics of the companies leaving or Americans losing their jobs. Bet you don't have any<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump . You should be working instead of using taxpayer dollars to play golf.

<|startoftext|>Lucy Flores said @JoeBiden was standing behind her put his hands on her shoulders and kissed her on the "top" of her head. She must be 4ft tall for someone behind her to kiss her on the "top" of her head. What do you think?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr How do you know this investigation was not about russia? Did you see the report? If I were you I would wait for the report to be published and let the American people decide before you come to these conclusions<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HillReporter Yeah right,,,what? Her and her private email account. N0 tRump will ever hold a political office again because of #45 and his bs. She will probably be in jail with the rest pf her criminal family<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump if you're innocent, please let this play itself out. #SDNY can't touch you if you are innocent. Defending yourself everyday and calling people names makes it seem like want you are guilty as hell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Khashoggi, gun control, America needs a President who represents America, not the GOP, his followers or himself. 45 is unhinged about his future once he leave office. #SDNY, #BLUEWAVE2020,  #VOTE2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump is on national TV bragging about himself and what he has done for this country, how many votes he got, the witch hunt hoax, Robert Muller. The country part is appreciated but what about the floods, in the midwest, Flint water crisis, children locked up in cages,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProudResister And a FRAUD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump should be talking about the floods happening in the mid-west flooding and all the disasters happening in this country. But he is on TV bragging about votes and what he is doing regarding the economy, not about him and the Democrats. Never talked about,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@parscale @realDonaldTrump @TheJusticeDept That you are!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It began when 45 fired Mr Comey over this russher thing and Rosenstein appointed Special Counsel Robet Muller to investigate it. 45 started the probe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani You had a back channel connection with Cohens Attorneys. Are you upset in didn't go in your favor.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump #45 started this whole investigation by firing Comey about this russher thing,,,he just didn't know Rosenstein would hire Muller to look into his allegations, now its a witch hunt and hoax. A lot of witches were caught though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump Nixon all over again,,,tRumpgate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Ok #45,,,so you say they found no collusion, BUT,,,look what they did find. People are even serving time. Manafort thought he was free until SDNY stepped in.  So now you know  whats gonna happen to you when you leave 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandPaul Maybe they used Collusion to find obstruction, fraud, treason, greed, sexual abuse, racism and hate to prove he is a russian puppet trying to destroy our country. They found many witches in this investigation including #45 and his family.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Dianne12mc @Mimirocah1 @LincolnsBible Wonder what @FLOTUS thinks about this one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mediaite But he said he didn't know her<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump @SenRickScott @RepMattGaetz @GovRonDeSantis @SarahPalinUSA @GOPChairwoman But @realDonaldTrump  said he did not know her.

<|startoftext|>More coverup from tRump campaign.  Don Jr., Eric tRump and Jared Kushner met at tRump tower. This is a good read and we already know Individual 1 won't know nothing. #SMDH  https://t.co/jJdNKQiCMq<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Just like POTASS, can't spell. He will get his GED in jail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tweetmommybop Everything,,,thats why he ordered his school not to release his records. Donald The Hump Trump is a big dummy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill @FLOTUS She is so scripted. No emotion, no sense of caring and no passion when she speaks. I challenge her to Be Out and leave the white house. This is not a fashion show. We probably won't see her again until it's time for POTASS to start his campaign rhetoric,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Can the Democrats call for a National Emergency to get rid of you by any means necessary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The GOP congress didn't do it. They were in charge for 2 years. This border emergency didn't exist then. Now the Dems have the house you are calling for a National Emergency? Give me a break. The Emergency is getting rid of you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr You lied about the russian meeting. You and your entire family are a joke. You're gonna look good in your orange suit. It will match the orange hamberder guy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Yes,,,he is tired of defending and lying for you!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec @realDonaldTrump They have only been in office for 60+ days and the Democrats are doing all of this or is one of your false statements to defend #45. Its nor a fishing expedition, its looking for the Truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So why don't you call Mr Spakovsky and speak with him regarding this issue. Twitter is not the place for you to call him out. What, You can't hold a decent conversation?. What are you afraid the Senators will find?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Why are you so concerned? If you did nothing wrong relax. Only guilty people become unhinged like you. Sit back and watch it play out. Bad boy, bad boy what you gone do when they come for you! 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @DevinNunes @FoxNews Boy are they nailing you with crime. To keep what dignity you have left and for the sake of your children and grandchildren you should step down.

<|startoftext|>@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump He need monies for commissary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump We have had a country for decades and border crimes are down,,,this rhetoric not help you win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So what if he is being paid by Hilary Clinton. She is helping someone who needs help at this time. By the time you finish paying your lawyers you won't have any money left for commissary and you will do anything for a hamberder #lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Are you tweeting this nonsense to prove to 1/3 of America or flotus you're not a criminal? You are "Going Down" and all of America and the World will be watching. Republicans have abused the constitution long enough. Must end now!!! #bluewave2020 #bluetsunami2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You knew they were coming after you taxes, your charities, your family finances and your russian financial interests,,,your son said you don't need Americas money, all your monies comes from russia. calm down,,,this train just started rolling,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Did you read this book? Oh, you don't read. Why keep a liar on your payroll 10 yrs? Is it bcuz he lied for you numerous times and now he's telling? Never push anyone under the bus that knows all about your lies and your criminality. They will throw you under the train,,, Hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Nope,,,you lie!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhredDouglas @realDonaldTrump He'll have plenty of time to think about all this drama real soon. He will be haunted for a long time for all his misleading statements, and the bad treatment of the people of this Great Country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seadude56 @realDonaldTrump Because he is a two faced liar and will say anything to make him look good. If KJU hadn't responded to what he said we would not be hearing/reading this mess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Your name is being removed from just about everything you conned people to put it on. You're legacy is being dismantled by America &amp; other countries and you're still in office. Can't wait to see if anyone remembers you when all is said and done and you're in jail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Crowd,  crowd, size does not matter at this point,,,wait until 2020 and see how big the crowd size will be when a new Democratic President is elected. You inflate everything including your taxes. #BLUEWAVE2020,,,ooops i mean #bluetsuami2020 #Senate, #Congress, #OvalOffice<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Something is MEDICALLY wrong with @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waltshaub He is obsessed with crowd size. He is sweating, and blabbing about the fact that he has TIVO, bashing Comey &amp; Sessions,,,what is going on in the White House,,,when does this madness end<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The GOP did not defend POTASS (individual 1) at all. They just wanted to bash Michael Cohenand try to make him look bad and it backfired on them. Gym Jordan, there was plenty of new news, you just refused to acknowledge it. #BLUEWAVE2020,,,I mean #tsunami2020,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Now we can ask you "Why YOU Didn't Do It". You met with KJU twice and you still came up empty with no plans of achieving Sh*t. #BLUEWAVE2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump should not be making comments about Spike Lee. What did Spike say that was so racist. He better leave Spike alone or he will make a movie about the #45 legacy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Why is it bad for our country? We didn't collude with Russians or have a private meeting, or laugh it up the Oval office with them. Our country did nothing so it's not bad for us. It's bad for you and it must continue to the truth comes out<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Name calling again,,,grow up donnie,,,its not a good look<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Why keep attacking the media? If you are telling the truth, stop bashing the media. You make the story bigger by denying it. Innocent people let things play out instead of attacking every article. You make yourself look guilty as hell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Extremely low<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Yes, it is the 2nd (second) witch hunt. The first witch hunt bought Nixon down and he resigned as his position. Will you leave quietly or will you be dragged out fighting. I can't wait for this "witch hunt" to be over. You're going down #45<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump When did America become radical? There you go name calling again and you can't take it when someone call you mushroom d**k or captain little hands. If you can dish it you should be able to take it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump That's because you are a fake #45. Totally unfavorable with a 39% approval rating,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump YCRS,,,you can't  remember sh*t. How do you expect people to respect you when you disrespect women.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump #45 you did do a great job for the richest Americans. But what about the rest of the country. There are far more under priviledge people in America than rich Americans. We will vote you out. #BLUEWAVE2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@8maggiemay @realDonaldTrump He watched the movie Sicario and an actor playing a Muslim put three prayer rugs down, then blew himself up. The girl kidnapped was blindfolded and taken away. This is why he wants a border wall. Movies are not a National Emergency<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Well then #45 they can win just like you did if they have to. You are done mr hamberder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What about taxes and how they were suppose to help. You said we would get more money back at the end of the year, but we are paying.

<|startoftext|>@KellyannePolls Since you told CNNs Jim Sciutto that you watch TV, you and #45 should go on demand and watch Border Wars. Maybe you will learn how drugs come into this country. He can buy you some hamberders and some cold fries. Oh, what's up with your hair?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump These were 304,000 that came about because of the shutdown. People had to feed their families and keep a roof over their heads. But you #caved anyway,,,Go Speaker Nancy. #45 your nightmare has just begun<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Wolverinish_Dad @SpeakerPelosi Nancy Pelosi has been Speaker of the House since January, 2019. The country is in a worse position since #45 ordered the shutdown in December.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump How do you know the statistics of Mexicos murders. 9 people died this weekend at the hands of US citizens and you never mentioned it.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Do you really think Americans does not understand English. We know what we saw and heard. We don't know what your Intel team told you but my gut tells me you don't want America to know how much danger you are putting America in so you call it fake news<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BBCWorld Yes He did. God wanted to expose tRump to the American people so we can learn who he really is i.e. traitor, crooked family, thief, russian spy, racist etc. God wanted Americans to see who they are doing business with so contractors can make better decisions not to deal with him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump you will never stop heroin, cocaine or any drugs coming into this country with a wall. You act like you don't understand you will never stop it. It's not only coming from the Southern Border. You just want your name on it. The tRump wall blah blah blah<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump We will find out when Cohen testify. You always think about you, what they did to you. What about people standing on line at food pantries to get a hot meal bcuz you won't pay them. You have made a mockery of the oval office, Kanye using the F bomb, laughing it up with russians<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanAFournier @realDonaldTrump Oh please,,,when CNN broke the story they said it was not confirmed,,,stop bashing the media,,,if you listen you can learn something like #45 is fake and is the enemy of the people,,,shutting down peoples livelihoods,,,that's an enemy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@illy064 @jimseagolf @realDonaldTrump He can't help himself,,,he thinks this is a reality show. He needs to get his hair done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump All because you lied and said isis was defeated, people lost their lives lives. The people you are not paying is the wall you claim you so badly need,,,TSA, Coast Guard, Border Officers, ICE and our Military. That's the wall you need but you're not paying. Grow up &amp; open Gov't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse I hope it about opening the border<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You can't stop Drugs and criminals from coming here. It lives here and its been here for a long time and the tRump name can't stop it.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The Democrats will Make America Respected Again,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump He wants his name on the wall. That's why he is campaigning and hurting America,,,all for his namesake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump If that's true, why do you put pUtin first? Why are government workers not working? Did you know more terrorists have easy access to the US bcuz of your actions. You dont care about America. What about Soldiers/civilians dying? You sd isis was gone. Another lie,  STOP LYING TO US<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump you need to watch National Geographic Channel to learn how drugs are coming into this country. You will never stop it with a wal i'l with your name on it. Educate yourself and open the Government!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump And In the end they found you,,,this will go down as the "Greatest Witch Hunt" in the history of our country along with your wall. The Big Orange Witch has fallen<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GinnyMac55 @GOP @realDonaldTrump Exactly, he will never stop drugs from coming to America,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump does not really care about this wall, he is trying to make history by building a wall and calling it a tRump wall. He wants his name to shine. He will see people murdered just to get a wall with the tRump name on it and it's all about a distraction<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffreyGuterman The corners of his fish (Nemo) mouth look white,,,a sure sign of drug use<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@krassenstein Wow,,,imagine if pUtin was wearing a wire at the time of the meeting and has info on @realDonaldTrump that could really damage his credibility,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Singing Happy Birthday to our beautiful, elegant and lovely First Lady Michelle Obama,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You are petty,,,its time for you to grow up and act like you have sense,,,this is not a reality show and you think it's a distraction.  It's not #45.

<|startoftext|>@AtamboerRobert @funder @realDonaldTrump But drugs come through tunnels. One thing I do know Rob is drugs will never stop entering America. This has been going on since the 60s and 70s and maybe even earlier. A wall will not drugs. BTW nice bike,,,I ride the HD Street Glide,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AtamboerRobert @funder @realDonaldTrump Yes Healthcare/Border Security is needed,,,Liberal logic, Not,,,there is a need and a problem does exist where healthcare is concerned. Shutting down the Government is not a solution. It only increases the crime rate here. People will do what they have to for their families<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AtamboerRobert @funder @realDonaldTrump No,,,I believe in Security at the border. Walls don't stop tunnels,,,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AtamboerRobert @funder @realDonaldTrump Mexico is paying for the wall,,,HIS WORDS not Americans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DixieKoch5 @funder @realDonaldTrump Caring for American citizens by shutting down their livelihoods, their medical needs etc? You're a nurse and you see peoples needs every day,,,and this is what our grandchildren and their children have to look forward to In the future. THIS IS NOT CARING  AMERICAN CITIZENS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funder @realDonaldTrump Since Barr said no need to change the law on indicting POTUS' he will only be free for the next 2 years. He will not be #45 forever,,,SDNY will be waiting for him on January 20, 2020. He will finally get his 2020.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump #45 it's time you stop hurting Americans, peoples needs are not being met, Soldiers are being killed/not paid, children are not getting the medical attention etc. Show what dignity you have left in you and please open the Gov't. This situation is absurd and needs to stop !!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What about the Coast Guard working to save lives, and could loose their lives, working without pay,,,p<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump It's not about a wall,,,he wants to make it hard for Democrats to do their job. But he better think again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump No you aren't. Who are you telling this mess to, your base? Yeah, you did say Mexico would pay for the wall,,,you cut regulations for the rich and gave the 1% a tax increases,,,but to close our country down for a wall doesn't appear to be what you pledged to do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What did you do. Put russia before America?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMaxineWaters @foxat59 Go after #45 taxes,,,they will answer all of our questions about tRump and russia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyOstroy I don't trust anyone working for tRump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So in the past 2 years while you had both Congress and senate. Why didn't you get funding from them? Your only goal here is to try and distract from what you did and said at the meeting with pUtin,,they will Subpoena your translator,,,cant wait to hear what they find out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamSkyThief @CindyMickler @FLOTUS @WhiteHouse #45 walked out of the last meeting which lasted 15 minutes that was planned well in advance,,,why should they give up their vacation knowing if he don't get his way he will walk out,,,and he told his base (us) Mexico is going to pay for the wall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamSkyThief @jdc_atl @oneDown5iveUp @CindyMickler @FLOTUS @WhiteHouse Probably?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump We've been waiting for 2 years to see you gone. Can't wait to see you gone. You're disgracing America and the World is laughing at you tRump,,,remember when they laughed at you at the UN. They are still laughing louder than you think tRumpsky<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Why should Congress come to negotiate with you? All you gonna do is walk out because you can't have your way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this making America great again @realDonaldTrump ???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Consequences should be true,,,pUtin and $$$ won the election. Not you. Ask McConnell and Lyndsey/Lindsay whoever,,, just ask how much they got<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You need to do something with your hair and your puffy eyes while your waiting,,,you look a mess. Today you have hair tomorrow you don't,,,which is it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelh920 @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump And he said Russia was a great country before he said the United States was a great country. Is Russia first now<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews How do you know thousands of illegal aliens committed sexual crimes,,,did you arrest them,,,did you see the arrest reports from Mexico,,,or are they unhinged just like you? You know it takes a sexual predator to know a sexual predator #45,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Wait and let the report become public and America will make it's own decision. All this name calling only reduces your credibility,,,I cant wait to hear the name they give you #lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I bet at this point you wish you didn't run to be #45. All your business, before &amp; after 2017 is out and America knows who you really are.  Are you really a Russian Spy #45????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pizzafaice @realDonaldTrump #45 is loosing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Yep,,,this is it,,,you are a the top of the list of "Witches" of this "witch hunt". Do yourself and leave with the 1% dignity you have left or you're going down with none!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Was this new deal approved yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Now he wants to try and use funds allocated to rebuild Puerto Rico ,,, it's not about the wall,,,its about him and the lies he fed his base to steal the electon,,,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@diva_bronze @PeterParros Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now it's a crisis at the border. Wonder why it just became an imigration crisis,,,I thought it was a security issue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is it, since the Democrats won the house, this issue about the southern border is so important? It should been just as important when the GOP had the house. This to me is a total distraction #MUELLERSTILLCOMING, #SDNYSTILLCOMING<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So you are telling me people are happy about not getting paid, not being able to buy food, not being able to put gas in their cars to go to work for nothing and you're saying these people support you? Something is wrong with you #45,,,please see a doctor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@krassenstein I will be watching the OWN channel. I'm sick of his bold faces lies and the fact is that he knows he is lying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I'll be watching the OWN network<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Tell the American people that with this shutdown the airlines, trains, boats etc, being the main entry point of terrorist, that they can get on Airplanes to enter this country easier than ever before. It appears you have a problem with Hispanics becoming Americans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Didn't you say ISIS was disassembled, defeated, done, gone out of Syria?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani What???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Grow up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump How many tunnels do you think this wall will stop? NONE...sad...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You're not fair to Government workers,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Maybe if you explain why Mexico is not paying for the wall we will be able to figure it out. You campaigned hard on the fact that "Mexico would pay for the wall". Please tell America what happened and why you lie so much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @SpoxDHS @CNN @TSA Sure they are,,,calling in sick everyday,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Did this happen at the Southern border,,,or from all entry points,,,you will never be able to stop the flow of drugs into this country with a wall at the southern border,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gmasonii @realDonaldTrump Because he wanted to blame the Democrats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You are EVIL. what goes around comes around . You need to stop this mess so people can get back to ordinary business. People cant  take care of their business bcuz of a wall? You will be held accountable in 2020 all for a wall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@krassenstein Sorry for what's happening to you,,,I would take their picture and place it on Social Media to expose this person,,,but be careful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can #45 call the Congress Woman disrespectful for the word she used when he sat in the Oval Office and let Kanye West same word and #45 smirked about it. tRump uses profanity all the time!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump did you see and hear Hakeem Jeffries introduce Nancy Pelosi ,,,and he was not reading (like some powerful people do all the time). Somebody better learn something #lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrianKarem @GinnyMac55 You mean the most habitual liar history of any Party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kokomothegreat @JMyers1971 Its always about #45,,,he doesn't care what people think,,,he wants his  name to shine,,,it will shine really bright soon,,,#Mueller2019 #SDNY2020 #2021JAIL #kidstofollow2021<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the name calling needs to stop!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But he is sounding very desperate at this point for something to happen in his favor. He really feels he needs a win now,,,he needs calm down and listen to other peoples advice!!!. I see why no one wants to work with him. He's all about his interest not Americas interest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is @realDonaldTrump on TV blabbering about, Dems, Mexico, Healthcare, the wall, India, Russia,  Syria, Yemen, Iran, Iraq and the "Reports" etc. We know what reports he is talking about,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarackObama Happy New Year to you and your family Mr President,,,we will be right there with you helping "Make America Respected Again"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump LIAR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It's not the Democrats not caring about  open borders, it's the American people not caring about tRump and his disrespect for them DOTARD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @jairbolsonaro Too bad you don't know how to make a good speech. Especially reading to the Troops and not using your own words. No one time could you look at them, while reading, your fake speech. You're an embarrassment to the United States of America #RESIGN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@I_ask_2017 @AP Yep!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Why do you call people names and then get mad about what people write or say about you.  What's good for the goose is good for the gander. Oh, the "fake news" line that you use is played out,,,try another line,,,so is witch hunt, hoax and the Democrats fault,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It would be good if it were true. Look at the stock market. What happened? Say something now about the "stock market" that you bragged about. So much for winning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse The only thing you will win is a jail cell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I know you didn't read it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Well it's your turn now,,,Democrats are stopping your agenda now!!!  you had full control for two years,,,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GinnyMac55 Happy New Year,,,he's probably there and saying he is at the WH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews This is like the GOP Not Approving President Obamas choice for SCOTUS. Now you're gonna punish average Americans to pay for what you campaigned Mexico would pay for. What goes around comes around<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Kimberly is not Robert Mueller and she knows nothing about what he has on you. Don't worry you will find out sooner than you think #hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Kimberly is only 1 person,,,how many millions of Americans who are witnessing what you call "Hoax"? Believe me more people see this is not a hoax than the 1 person you believe. But if it makes you feel better than,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Lies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What about Americans pay,,,people need to keep a roof over head, buy food, and pay bill's. Some of the people you gave jobs to are now not getting paid. Do you really think they will support you in 2020. And, what happened to the Stock Market, I'm afraid to look at my 401K<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You never cease to amaze me #45,,,never a dull moment of your madness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It is pathetic how you use peoples tragedies bolstering to your base. How can you say this little girls father did not give her water for days? How many days? Did he tell you that? It's a bold faced lie and your base is getting tired of you lying to them all the time,,,UGH<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump And Putin would have gotten the penthouse.  Didn't you know becoming #45 you would be investigated the same way you tried to bring President Obama down about where he was born? Now the world knows who you really are<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I KNOW DAM WELL YOU DIDN'T WRITE THIS LETTER NOR DID YOU READ ON THE HISTORY OF PRESIDENT BUSH.,,,IF YOU DID YOU WOULD ACT LIKE A PRESIDENT INSTEAD OF A NUT JOB<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KarlaAshenhurs2 @ezrateach @realDonaldTrump He is the dog<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump And you took this country even further in the wrong direction (to put it mildly)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So you sold America out so you could do business with Russia? America investigates every sitting president to make sure they are not corrupt, if you were so smart and your gut told you everything, you would have known this and Ivanka would not have used a private email server<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funder I totally agree 200%,,,being unhinged like he is and new things coming out every day he is definitely a flight risk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS And no extra money in our pockets,,,people loosing jobs,,,what else are you wishing for<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What's the matter #45,,,are you getting ants in your pants anticipating what Mueller has coming for you. Now the Attorney who would take a bullet for you is singing his head off. Be patient,,,THEY ARE COMING #LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngelaBelcamino 😈😈😈💩💩💩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This will eventually cause children to retaliate and sometimes its really bad,,,and they end up takikg their own lives because of bullies. So sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuzMember In the US some children that are bullid get guns and go after their bullies shooting up schools. I believe this is what causes a lot of school shootings and some people wonder why kids do this. This boy choked the kid and tried to make him drink something,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BooleanOper8or @realDonaldTrump I told my husband the same thing. That is why #45 is so unhinged. He is upset because Mueller waited for his responses to the questions. Then with those answers he came down on Manafort. Mueller knew he would catch them lying. I like Muellers way of doing things<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Mueller only wants you,,,deal with it<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You started this mess with Twitter,,,now deal with it. No other president in history has run the country on Twitter. Only you,,,calm down and go answer Muellers questions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrsRabbitResist Dont know all facts but I think its bogus. Remember he is suing @realdonaldtrump for Stormey Daniel's. I  think there is something fishy about this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is there 3 African American men standing behind him (2 Pastors including Paula White),,,is he trying to show he cares,,,not buying it. He lost and is trying to make up for his recklessness,,,not buying it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse He got laughed at by World Leaders at the UN and is embarrassed, he acted like a nut during the elections doing rallies,,,now doesn't show up to honor WW1 Veterans and sat in the White House tweeting on Veterans day. What a disgrace to our Great Nation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN Imagine how tRump would act if Robert Mueller was to ask questions he doesn't like. Mueller would have to tell him to "sit down" and answer the question. He went be able to walk away<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ActMeasuresDoc @realDonaldTrump Vote in 2020 to get rid of the mess<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Your trip was to honor Americans who lost their lives in the war and you didn't go. You were the only one who didn't show up. Everyone else walked and you didn't. The World Leaders are still laughing at you. No excuses. YOU'RE AN EMBARRASEMENT to America<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Yeah right,,,you didn't show up to honor Americans,,,you mad bcuz WORLD LEADERS, laughed at you and you were too embarrassed to attend. They didn't want hear your mess<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump There you go blaming the Democrats again. Maybe stocks fell becuz of the way you used tax payer dollars to fly to Paris only to turn your back on honoring Americans who fought and lost their lives for this country<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Like why is the Stock Market falling or is this "fake news"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RickieBansbach @queensue31954 @realDonaldTrump No one else is smiling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You sit around watching CNN, tweeting all day about what is wrong in America. The Democrats, 52 States, cable, the election etc. Put your phone down do some presidential work for once. Your hatred speaks volumes, but we know a distraction when we see one #ROBERTMUELLER #NYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Obama should never forgive you on how you treat our "MILITARY". You want to throw out their votes, never once visited those fighting for our country and you "BAILED" out of the Ceremony honoring them. You are the one who dont care.

<|startoftext|>@jazziegrace @krassenstein What if the indictments were already sealed, will the acting AG be able to block them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@krassenstein I think he knows it,,,that is why he is so unhinged,,,disrespecting  Journalists,,,acting crazy in Paris and calling FL elections a fraud with no proof. Just doing and saying crazy things. He says he is smarter than anyone,,,but #45,  Muller is smarter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattyhoyeCNN @AprilDRyan @Acosta @realDonaldTrump He is afraid of whats he faces back home,,,upset about the election,,,his children are facing indictments and Mark Whittaker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When will the GOP see what tRump is doing to their reputations. It's amazing how after so many years in public service you stoop to this level of disrespect, #45 does not care about you and he never has, this was all for his love of money,,,grow up there still time!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You should Vet people before you put them in a position that needs a security clearance. How could you have not known. You said "I am very smart". Did you lie again?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PressSec This is the most "history" making administration I ever witnessed in my life. Every sentence ends with "history".

<|startoftext|>@vqlerie762 @MichaelAvenatti You are 100% right. He didn't help his Attorney Michael Cohen,,,I hope Sessions decide to come clean after being fired. He needs to tell Muller everything he knows about tRump and Russia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@krassenstein Its really sad to see how many Americans think this is a scary time for the US. This iish is real and #45 doesn't care. I'm praying for a peaceful resolution and that America does not suffer from the rhetoric this administration spews.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aymanndotcom It looked to me like she turned into his hand, which was up, as she tried to snatch the mic from him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PressSec You are suppose to be a well educated church going mother raising  your children to be honest Americans. The "TRUTH" will make you free Sarah.

<|startoftext|>@krassenstein Brian this really makes me think that #45 will hurt America before his 2 years are up!  His mentality appears to be "if I go down I'm taking America with me". We can only pray for the best<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump All Jim did was ask you about the "caravan" You appear to be unhinged over this Mueller investigation and it was clear yesterday. If you are Innocent prove it to the American people and get on with your job. As #45<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You can initiate a stop to this VIOLENCE #45. But it appears now the only thing on your mind is the investigation of you. If you are innocent let it play out. You would probably get more respect America,,,I couldn't comprehend your actions against Jim Acosta,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@krassenstein He is guilty and even if he shuts it down I'm sure Mr Muller has covered himself and this investigation. Mr. Muller has been doing this long enough to know what to do. #45 Is guilty of something pertaining to this investigation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@krassenstein He better hope Sessions does not "Flip" on him as Sessions was the first one who endorsed #45. He has to know something about this Russian investigation. And tRump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@67Lasse67 @realDonaldTrump Clear and present danger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump We see your true colors shining through. If you are so innocent why act guilty. If you have nothing to hide let it play out.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I think you lost a lot of support by showing in a State that asked you not to come until the deceased were mourned and buried.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You are always trying to defend and distract. Treated very warm by how many people? 3 maybe 4 this is America and all you could attack was 3 or 4 people out of a State you won. Another show disgrace and a loss for you. You should have stayed home!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Has anyone noticed that every name #45 calls people fits  him personally,,,Crooked, Thief, Liar, Horse Face, Enemy of the People,  Fake, Child Molester, Womanizer and his eyes are puffy. He talks about himself every time he opens his fish  "NEMO" looking mouth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@krassenstein @RonDeSantisFL @AndrewGillum He was talking about himself,,,,he is a "THIEF"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawnHenslee @StephenGlahn @realDonaldTrump When the electoral college gave tRump the seat in the White House,,,SAD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You are the flame that needs to be put out,,,everything and I mean everything is absolutely true. Where is Mueller? Isn't he coming for you after the elections #hahahaha,,,a little nerve wracking isn't it<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is what we have come to,,,threatening to kill 8 and 12 year old children because they are black,,,this man should be banned from all social media outlets. This is "DOMESTIC TERRORISM" at its finest with Brian Kemp @donlemmon @chriscummo @realdonaldtrump @homelandsecurity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I knew he was lying when he said it. Thousands of people lost their lives that day and on the same day as a massacre he lies about a previous one #VOTEBLUE2018  Trump falsely claims NYSE opened day after 9/11 to justify holding rally after massacre   https://t.co/ICgwzuaOyI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @jaketapper Oh wow,,,you just described yourself. Thanks for summing up who you really are!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump This hatred, division and disrespect for humans life is all you fault,,,you spread hate,,,and yes it has to stop but it should stop with the person in charge first<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Wait,,,you're gonna speak to the media. You spoke the New York Governor on the morning this domestic terrorist was arrested, 4 days later,,,now you want to speak to the "fake news". You need help #45<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You responded to shootings, which you should have, faster than the 14 real Bombs that could have killed multiple people and you still spew hatred. Your base is catching on to you. All you want to do is win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It about time for you to act your real age and stop calling people names. Grow up and act like a leader instead of a divider!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Presidents don't criticize people in the real world. Only you ,,, which is why the world is laughing at you. #BLUEWAVE2018<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump are you upset that these bombs, killing devices are getting more attention than you. You just wait until November 6th.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdKrassen @wreidlr Or for using bots<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Ut oh,,,are you losing,,,don't cry,,,you said "I'm not a baby"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It's time for you to "RESIGN". If you don't realize the significance of what's happening in America with these bombs aimed at your enemies you are seriously troubled and you don't belong in the position of leading America. BTW the republicans were and are losing. #BLUEWAVE2018<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Diddy @justpiombo Hey Diddy,,,that's awesome to help out with education. Can you please tweet something about the importance of voting. We only have 12 days left. We NEED a voice like yours. I have nothing but love for you and for all that you do for others,,,you speak, people listen,,,Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedTRaccoon How would America know about you and your agenda if the Media doesn't report it. We found out about your infidelity,  Russia and tRump, Saudi Arabia and tRump, treason, collusion, construction of justice and tRump. When Mueller finishes, who knows what else we will learn?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @GiuseppeConteIT Are you trying to distract America from what is about to happen to you? Innocent people could have been killed unless you know otherwise. Time to focus on the problems here and not a caravan, not or Italy and France at the moment. American lives matter or was this a lesson?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @GiuseppeConteIT I have never called you Presideny but Mr mr president what about America. Do you realize there were 10 bombs at homes and offices of Americans whom you dislike. You should not be blaming the Media. Everything they report about you is not fake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PalmerReport Sarah needs that paycbeck,,, she's like Mikey,,,she'll say anything for that paycheck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@krassenstein Trust me #45 knows all about it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoriBianco2 @AlexBednar3 @realDonaldTrump @ScottWalker @LeahVukmir And the people he paid to wear red hats, shirts, sweaters, shoes and maybe even underwear. These people are only brainwashed for the money they so desperately need and they bring their entire families. #VOTEBLUE #bluetsuamicoming<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Your distractions are almost a thing of the past,,,#MUELLERISSTILLCOMING BAD BOY, WHAT YOU GONE DO WHEN THEY COME FOR YOU,,, "I'LL BE WATCHING AND GETTING MY DANCE ON,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someones base should read this entire article on BRAINWASHING<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@krassenstein This should be investigated now. Could this "INTEL" have been a list of tRumps enemies who happen to receive packages of bombs in the mail. Send this info to CNN, MSNBC, CBS, Cheddar, NY1 and all media outlets. THIS NEEDS TO COME TO LIGHT NOW!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CR_Masterson @AreLights @politicususa @Nevada_Dem Or the young man from American Idol who made the song "SHE BANG" "SHE BANG"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politicususa Mike Bolton,,,something is wrong with this man, medically. You don't even know who you sent to Russia. Somebody Anybody please help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@krassenstein And men claiming it ok to grab women because the president said so. Really?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngelaPalmente1 @realDonaldTrump #45 is the leader of the HATE PARADE IN AMERICA. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS HERE. ITS NOT COMING ACROSS ALL BORDER WALLS. THE WALL WILL NOT STOP AMERICAN TERRORISTS. ITS HOME GROWN. SENDING AMERICAN CITIZENS BOMBS IN AMERICA IS A FORM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND #45 IS PROMOTING IT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeSupport45 @realDonaldTrump @FBI @SecretService @Acosta @CNN I think the public should know what to look out for as a suspicious package. Remember everyone has cameras and one of them will tell the truth about who did it an why they did it. I know the tRump name will come up like the incident on the Airplane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Before you people were not walking around with hate signs asking for green cards, calling police on fellow citizens bcuz of their language or becuz they ride bikes in their neighborhood or bcuz they think someone doesn't live here. YOU DID THIS #45. Spewing so much hatred<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You're reading and you don't mean what you're reading.  I thought to myself he's gonna try and turn this around on the people that received bombs. Low and behold you did just that. Wow, you're making America HATE Again. MAHA by #45 is what you really want<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @ScottWalker @LeahVukmir I pray no one gets hurt,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @ScottWalker @LeahVukmir You are EVIL. When you go to "JAIL"  I hope inmates treat you the way you treat the individuals you blame. The Media didn't do this. You and your hatred did. People could have died and all you do is spew hatred so you can get applause. "WATCH GOD".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @ScottWalker @LeahVukmir How can you even  look in the mirror and think this is ok. Your hatred is really going to get you and your WH November. There's a storm in the WH and you got to move. This is not cute. Watch God!!! #BLUEWAVECOMINGNOV6TH,,,BYE BYE, #YOUWONTBEMISSED<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @ScottWalker @LeahVukmir Despicable #45 it's a shame you stand in front of your base and not offer any nice words  to the Clinton's, Obama, Soros, Waters, Holder or anyone who received bombs in the mail. You did this and you refuse to take any credit for it. Vengeance is mine said the Lord<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Totally agree!!! SHUT THEM DOWN and anybody who tries to explain away this viscous rhetoric he shouts at every rally,,,This is his fault.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump This is all you fault. The rhetoric you and disrespect that comes from your mouth created these monsters. How do suppose we unite with this BS you LLP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HollyResist My condolences<|endoftext|>

It's starting now,,,How do you feel about your name being taken off buildings you do not own in New York? The Democrats did it????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The republicans  holds the majority. Why  do you blame the Democrats for everything you screw up. I can't believe this is happening in real life. Your fake position is like a fake book. You better stop, what goes around comes around<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeSupport45 @realDonaldTrump @RonDeSantisFL @EPN @TheDemocrats @georgesoros That is so not true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @RonDeSantisFL That's not what I saw,,,Gillum got more positive responses from the audience and desantis was nervous because he could not override Gillums answers. #GalliumforGovernor2018<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So Khashoggi was killed at his interview that went wrong, what will tRump do? His money is tied up with Saudi and Russia and he don't want to lose his position with them. That's why he wont implicate Russia and he won't say anything negative about Saudi Arabia.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@krassenstein God always has the last word<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Acosta Yeah just like the World Leaders weren't laughing at him but with him,,,he is absolutely out of his mine<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#45 was acting like Kavanaugh was acting while he was mocking Dr Ford,,,I dont think they have the votes to put BK through<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheRynheart @joelytrumpshate @LindseyGrahamSC I think, like Kavanaugh,  Graham was doing  an interview to be the next  Attorney General,,,he is either guilty of something or applying for AG position,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WednesFri @Heisi12989491 @bjaninemorison @realDonaldTrump Would you want a bias liar having screaming fits while boozing it up to be the judge in a case you were involved in,,, you dont know your future.

<|startoftext|>@janefranklin55 @SpotsyHoya @KenDilanianNBC @FoxNews What about Whelan,,,he knew who she was before hand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PreetBharara I don't trust Flakr as far as I can throw a straw,,,he is grandstanding and the GOP knows they dont have the votes yet,,,this should have been done last week and Kavanaugh would not have been in front of the World crying like his pamper was full<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenKamalaHarris @VeronicaDevine6 I believe Whelan I'm s responsible for leaking Ms Fords name,,,remember he checked her LinkedIn account BEFORE she named as the person charging Brett Kavanaugh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lazizabites @SenFeinstein They are afraid that the truth will override this election,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why hasn't the Democrats said anything about Whelan who searched Ms Fords LinkedIn account before her name became public? How did they have so many signatures in Kavanaughs favor so quick?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HotlineJosh Will the real Brett Kavanaugh please stand up,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@psychomurf @DrainTheCommies @Psilysillygirl @twidderoftweets @realDonaldTrump For Real<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MrDane1982 @4EverCynCity And she didn't cry like a baby<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SymoneDSanders He has done a 360 in his attitude since respectfully John McCain passed. I think Lindsey Graham knows the GOP is done and they need a new candidate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whoever advised him did him a disservice,,,look how he acting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kavanaugh comes across as a man scorned bcuz she told on hhim<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@krassenstein It appears he's upset bcuz the World knows who he really is. Ms Ford was the victim but she didn't cry like this baby is crying,,,he will blame anybody now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GinnyMac55 Will he cry when the other Justices don't agree with him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is Kavanaugh crying like that,,,Ms Ford only told the truth,,,he is trying convince his wife publicly, before he becomes toast, that he is innocent. Ms Fords testimony was very credible,,,everytime he lie he takes a sip of water and then cries again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC is sitting there laughing like no matter what she say we will confirm Kavanaugh,,,he is so disrespectful and should be slapped<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SymoneDSanders Because he can corroborate her story,,,he will eventually be bought in under oath if Kavanaugh is confirmed,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@krassenstein He is out of order,,,no way can he get away with this old behavior<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@monicatrump1 @ChrisCuomo Wicked with the truth<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr You're gonna get a real break once you're incarcerated and a lot of time to think<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Do you understand you're going to jail? #bluewavecoming2018<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She knows he is lying,,,see how she is looking at him,,,reminds me of the look Melania gave tRump at his inauguration<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AprilDRyan His accusers,,,his wife knows he is lying and that is why he cut her off in answering the question about accusers being investigated<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I see this Rosenstein/Kavanaugh situation as a distraction, #45 does not want conservatives to watch Kavanaugh so he distracts with Rosenstein, we Americans can see thru you #45, #bluewavecoming #VOTEBLUEIN2018<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump That is why the GOP is rushing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LGTrombatore @BillCassidy They are rushing bcuz they know Muller is coming for tRump and the Senate and Congress won't have rule after 11/18,,,they are panicking and pushing a sexual predator into the SC,,,but he will be impeached and #45 will be in jail #bluewavecoming<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoelOsteen Amen,,,God is always at work,,,working things out,,,I stand firm on Gods word<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC If Kavanaugh gets voted in and then eventually gets impeached,,,you think the GOP looks bad now,,,you will be running out of office faster than a Cheetah #IJS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The cost of food, home goods and other supplies are rising just so you and your rich friends can benefit on your new taxes,,,you don't care about the people in this country,,,its all about you,,,better enjoy now bcuz a #bluewaveiscoming,,,#youarejailbound<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You are always talking about how you made "HISTORY". Yes you  are right about one thing,,,you are "HISTORY". First president to go to jail,,,  #BLUEWAVECOMING,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@krassenstein tRump/GOP doesn't want FBI involved bcuz they know FBI will find people from his past that will turn on him and tell the truth,,,FBI will investigate like Muller is investigating #45 and Kavanaugh will be toast!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What do you do? Sit on the WH toilet thinking of things to blame on Democrats? Democrats will not be your downfall,,,"YOU" will bring yourself down as well as the Republicans #BLUEWAVECOMINGFAST,,,Goodbye mushroom<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@atDavidHoffman 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm curious as to why Republicans are so upset about getting recordings at the 11th hr. when they dropped 45,000 documents on Democrats 6hrs before the start of Kavanaughs confirmation hearings. What's the difference?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@misterbumface @realDonaldTrump He's just trying to stay out of jail<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealDonaldTrFan @GinnyMac55 Based on what you "here" somebody lied to you,,,maybe if you could "hear" you would've understood,,,and if someone is not so smart why ask them a question in the first place,,,sounds like a PENDUMBO to me #lol<|endoftext|>
