<|startoftext|>@NathanLerner @AndrewYang @ProudSocialist @NathanLerner It is despicable to frame your healthcare privilege as pragmatism.

<|startoftext|>Framing the fact that the sick and disabled desperately need allies in and out of government to leverage their power because we are suffering and dying under the violence of this system as immature or ‚Äúgrrr‚Äù says a lot about how this violence has been normalized. #MedicareForAll<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We need a mass movement for #M4A . We need allies to pressure progressives like @AOC and hold corporate healthcare sponsored Dems like @SpeakerPelosi accountable.

<|startoftext|>@GregoryHardinII Instead of well, abled, or well insured people pontificating about strategy and a celebrity battle between @AOC and @jimmy_dore , how about a mass movement of allies for the sick and disabled holds progressives and centrists accountable for this violence? 1/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jsways12 @SpeakerPelosi We can hold them all accountable through a mass movement. Would be great if the well and abled were out in the streets protesting this violence.

<|startoftext|>@jsways12 I organize for M4A. I also have MS. The ONLY reason @SpeakerPelosi hasn‚Äôt brought #M4A to the floor is that the healthcare lobby accounts for at least a third of the DCCC contributions this cycle, Pelosi has taken at least 2.5M personally, Clyburn over 1M from pharma, etc. 1/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjaminPDixon While you are talking strategy, we‚Äôre suffering and dying out here without healthcare. @SpeakerPelosi has taken at least 2.5M from the healthcare lobby.

<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Giving people enough money to stay home is the most efficient way to reduce COVID cases. Giving them healthcare in case they get sick is the easiest way to reduce deaths.

<|startoftext|>@Asher_Wolf I would love to participate. I‚Äôm working on a couple pandemic related essays. I have MS and broke my ankle very badly in May. Been a long 6 months! Been writing about healthcare this past year.  https://t.co/wtdSlNIjWy  https://t.co/F5Ll2BwTJh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoFaith15 @ErickSternComas @RealScottRitter @AOC @EmmaSteigerwald you familiar with this extensive study too? You‚Äôve read and come to this conclusion as well? FYI- the study actually concluded that m4a would save 68,000 lives (conservatively) and $450 billion annually. You also like this bullying comment? Cool take. #Disability<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoFaith15 @ErickSternComas @RealScottRitter @AOC Did you read that extensive study by Yale epidemiologists and distill it that quickly? Healthcare is a right you monster and sacrificing sick and disabled people is eugenics.  https://t.co/wtdSlNIjWy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDemocrats I tried to use this insurance and pharma lobby funded empty platitude to pay for my $65,000 per year #MultipleSclerosis medicine, but it didn‚Äôt work. #MedicareForAll<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoFaith15 @ErickSternComas @RealScottRitter @AOC Also, it‚Äôs not an ‚Äúarticle ‚Äú. It‚Äôs an extensive study by 9 Yale epidemiologists. Amazing that you were able to read and process all the information in that 30 seconds between tweets. üôÑ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoFaith15 @ErickSternComas @RealScottRitter @AOC Again your insulting tone and ignorance on the issue are really really really really gross. We‚Äôre suffering and dying out here so you can play intellectual chess.  https://t.co/wtdSlNIjWy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoFaith15 @ErickSternComas @RealScottRitter @AOC When you are suffering and dying without the healthcare you need, it makes no difference if it‚Äôs because you have a pre-existing condition or you can‚Äôt afford the costs under the ACA or you‚Äôre being denied services under Medicare or Medicaid. Again, you are out of your depth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoFaith15 @ErickSternComas @RealScottRitter @AOC You‚Äôre out of your depth friend. It‚Äôs embarrassing. There shouldn‚Äôt be anyone dying without healthcare bud.  https://t.co/biIaoLbVlF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoFaith15 @ErickSternComas @RealScottRitter @AOC Those are more important dead people? There is nothing more despicable than trying to sell your privilege and lack of empathy as common sense and decency.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ErickSternComas @RealScottRitter @AOC You can try to sell it as ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù, but if you voted for Biden the 70,000 vulnerable Americans who will die under the ACA every year didn‚Äôt matter enough for you to condition your vote for them. As well as the millions bombed and droned into oblivion abroad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris @JoeBiden A right is not something which you have to pay for or to which the wealthy have better access. That‚Äôs class warfare. #MedicareForAll<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kgopinion Still disabling myself more everyday by working full time to keep my healthcare which will promptly abandon me when working full time makes me too disabled to continue working full time.

<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi When you suffer or die without the care you need it doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs because of a preexisting condition or you can‚Äôt afford your premium, deductible, copays, or prescriptions.

<|startoftext|>@c_wilsonj And what about the people like me who have never missed a payment in 10 years and now owe double what we borrowed, we should be made to suffer more, right? For being greedy idiots who want an education but aren‚Äôt rich kids, am I right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@c_wilsonj What about the rich kids whose parents paid for their education no questions asked, what about them? Seems like they should get some kind of reward too for not having any debt, no?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@c_wilsonj Or more importantly, what about the millions of boomers who have no student debt because they went to college before education became a predatory capitalist endeavor? Huh, what about them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Except providing healthcare amirite?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BombayBevo By unity you actually mean that people without basic rights like healthcare, housing, and food should pipe down and work for other people who have plenty of these things to hoard and control them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DisInHigherEd But in general, I think teaching without ego and with compassion. Academia is full of ego driven evaluation criteria. We need to shift that paradigm. Seems to have little value to the student‚Äôs‚Äô comprehension.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DisInHigherEd Well, in some ways I think in my particular case I and my students are blazing the trail. It can be exhausting but I think it‚Äôs important work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DisInHigherEd I love this thread. Thank you. I have MS, teach at a college with a lot of first generation students and students with accommodations of all kinds. It‚Äôs so important to model the diversity of disability for students!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden @JoeBiden , a ‚Äúright‚Äù is not something which you have to pay for and to which wealthier people have better access. That‚Äôs class warfare. #MedicareForAll #M4A<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zumrob They are not mutually exclusive. And are you saying that racial injustice is a ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù injustice?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gosh Rob, sorry to interrupt your brunch. #BlackLivesMatter #Philadelphia #phillyprotests #WalterWallaceJr #DefundThePolice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaylorMcFayden The lack of compassion that this capitalism breeds is horrific. People regularly tell me that I should shut up about the poor sick and disabled people who will die under Biden‚Äôs health plan. Like it‚Äôs a reasonable bargain. Rape survivors are ‚Äútiny details‚Äù apparently too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@freeulysses_tj @peterdaou @HowieHawkins @AngelaNWalker Well also by your argument it must be a vote against BOTH candidates, neutralizing itself. It‚Äôs not weighted ‚Äúagainst‚Äù one of the candidates more heavily. Personal preference or anxiety is not sound logic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tooposhtotweet @GopSux2 @SocialistAaron @JoeBiden I have been patient with you while you spout a lot of well formed but woefully uninformed opinions. I have MS and volunteer, research and write about the terrible healthcare system in the US. Your overall disrespect and ignorance about the topic is not a good look, friend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tooposhtotweet @GopSux2 @SocialistAaron @JoeBiden Ha, it‚Äôs pretty hilarious that you are trying to take me to school when you both have NHS healthcare and aren‚Äôt voting in this election, is that right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tooposhtotweet @GopSux2 @SocialistAaron @JoeBiden I‚Äôm voting third party and don‚Äôt want Biden either so by your argument then I‚Äôm also ‚Äúsplitting‚Äù the vote for Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tooposhtotweet @GopSux2 @SocialistAaron @JoeBiden Honestly, I just wish you would think about what you are saying. It doesn‚Äôt make sense. Split what vote? My vote is not promised to the Democrats and then taken away. Just because you‚Äôre all saying something illogical over and over doesn‚Äôt make it logical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tooposhtotweet @GopSux2 @SocialistAaron @JoeBiden Your logic isn‚Äôt sound. You are conflating your anxiety about the election with sound reason. Split what vote? My vote wasn‚Äôt in @JoeBiden ‚Äòs basket and then removed and given to another candidate. I understand that these are party line talking points but they don‚Äôt make sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tooposhtotweet @GopSux2 @SocialistAaron @JoeBiden So people will die worse under Trump? Again, you‚Äôve got to take some personal responsibility for what you are voting for. It sounds like an uncomfortable truth for you, but it‚Äôs a truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tooposhtotweet @GopSux2 @SocialistAaron @JoeBiden And to be called obtuse when you are begging people to take notice of the indecent bargain with the lesser of two evils that sacrifices the most vulnerable poor, sick, and disabled is pretty horrifying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tooposhtotweet @GopSux2 @SocialistAaron @JoeBiden No, you just don‚Äôt want to reckon with what you are voting FOR. 68,000 people will DIE next year, millions more suffer without healthcare under @JoeBiden ‚Äòs plan. And when you are suffering without the care you need it feels like fascism no matter which party it‚Äôs coming from.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@freeulysses_tj @peterdaou @HowieHawkins @AngelaNWalker I feel like folks really lack a fundamental understanding of how voting works. There is no one tallying ‚Äúagainst‚Äù votes. You are voting FOR a candidate and all of the policies they espouse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#phillyprotests #WalterWallaceJr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tooposhtotweet @GopSux2 @SocialistAaron @JoeBiden Will Biden? Again, I‚Äôm not sure why I expected to have a sound logical discussion on Twitter, but your voting logic isn‚Äôt sound.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GopSux2 @tooposhtotweet @SocialistAaron @JoeBiden It‚Äôs sad that folks like you don‚Äôt spend your time demanding a candidate who will help suffering people rather than demanding suffering people vote for a candidate who won‚Äôt help them. My medical bills run 200-300k a year. Pick up the tab, and we can talk about decency.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Noudidant @GopSux2 @tooposhtotweet @SocialistAaron @JoeBiden Actually, how voting works is that you don‚Äôt vote against a candidate, but FOR a candidate and all of their policies. You will be voting FOR 68,000 to die and millions more to suffer under @JoeBiden ‚Äòa health plan. Your projecting your voting ignorance on me is not so great.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GopSux2 @tooposhtotweet @SocialistAaron @JoeBiden It doesn‚Äôt take a whole lot of brain power to think this through from a logic standpoint friend. How exactly does it only help the least desirable choice? Least desirable for who? You? Your opinions aren‚Äôt statistics. Dear Lord I can‚Äôt believe I have to explain this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Noudidant @GopSux2 @tooposhtotweet @SocialistAaron @JoeBiden Yes yours love. Your premise that I don‚Äôt know how voting works because my vote was in your mind already in the Biden basket and now I‚Äôm taking it away. #BidenBros are super toxic. You are really angry that I‚Äôm exercising my democratic rights, huh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GopSux2 @tooposhtotweet @SocialistAaron @JoeBiden Oh okay, then you probably know that in PA, it was the Libertarians who got the majority of the third party vote. Sounds like your ‚Äúvoter outreach‚Äù should be aimed at disenfranchised Republicans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Noudidant @GopSux2 @tooposhtotweet @SocialistAaron @JoeBiden Again, your entire premise is based on the idea that my vote was previously promised to Biden and is now being ‚Äútaken away.‚Äù That is not how voting works. And your infantile insults are really unnecessary. And unlikely to prove successful as voter outreach.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tooposhtotweet @GopSux2 @SocialistAaron @JoeBiden That‚Äôs just weird magical thinking. A third party vote takes a vote away from both Biden and Trump. It‚Äôs not weighted more heavily on the Biden side. Why do you assume that third party voters owe some allegiance to Biden? We‚Äôre third party voters. Not Democrats, not Republicans.<|endoftext|>

You‚Äôve either got health and healthcare privilege or you‚Äôre unlucky enough to have disease and disability and an American public that doesn‚Äôt care if you suffer and die and tries to pass it off as pragmatism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sherwood_dan @Scrub_Tails @facts_matter1 @BrowardWoward @DrJillStein You don‚Äôt get to incrementally live or die without healthcare. There is nothing more offensive than folks trying to tout their privilege and lack of empathy as common sense and decency. #MedicareForAll #MultipleSclerosis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@facts_matter1 @BrowardWoward @DrJillStein Spoken like someone who isn‚Äôt dependent on the ACA while being seriously ill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We need Medicare-For-All now. My perspective:  https://t.co/wtdSlNIjWy             #MedicareForAll #MultipleSclerosis #HealthcareIsARight #M4A<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We need Medicare-For-All. Here‚Äôs my story:   https://t.co/wtdSlNIjWy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremy_7001 There is nothing more despicable than people like @billmaher who try to pass off their privilege and lack of empathy as common sense and decency. I bet he‚Äôs got really great healthcare. #MultipleSclerosis #MedicareForAll<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KnowN0thing1 This man is also helping Trump win by voter shaming instead of spending his time lobbying @JoeBiden and @DNC to support policies that would help him win in a landslide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Enjoneer01 @bourgeoisalien It‚Äôs a great article. I meant no criticism of you. I am just tired of people talking about the ‚Äúdecency‚Äù of voting for @JoeBiden. There is nothing decent about voting for a man who has pledged not to support Medicare For All, effectively condemning many Americans to suffer or die<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Enjoneer01 @bourgeoisalien Wish you had addressed the sick and disabled and our predatory, violent healthcare system. There are millions of us who suffer in pain and financial ruin and at least 68,000 who die a year. Not having the care you need feels like fascism no matter which party it‚Äôs coming from.<|endoftext|>
