<|startoftext|>#GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miami's defense came to play #NFL #NFLTwitter #KCvsMIA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Might be the most underrated WR in the NFL #NFL #NFLTwitter #TENvsJAX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm convinced Waterford could have 100 shots at Nickie Quaid and he'd save everyone of them, the last save was class #LIMvWAT #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Za'Darius is so underrated #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don‚Äôt get me wrong Raiola‚Äôs a pr*ck but has &amp; always has been doing what Pogba wanted him to do if he wasn‚Äôt Pogba would have a put a stop to do this a long time ago #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EliTheWright Just taken mine there, happy days üôå<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LeoVaradkar Good to see ye have finally decided to listen to @PearseDoherty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndoSport I agree splitting Dublin in two shouldn‚Äôt happen but if it did it the GAA wouldn‚Äôt be sacrificing its soul cause it did that a long time ago<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_scottsaunders He's so predictable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Out of the CL &amp; Ole should be out of a job #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Embarrassing #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AskSmythsToys Hi, your CS team contacted me on Facebook this morning &amp; I was to able get my issue sorted üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love to see it üòçüòçüòç @SmythsToysIRE #PS5  #PS5Ireland  https://t.co/AzJL5ECflY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Raiola's a c*nt but there's no way he says that without Pogba's say so, the sooner Pogba leaves the better he's nothing special #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When he was signed a lot of people myself included said he was over-paid it‚Äôs starting to look like we under-paid him #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don‚Äôt care if we have every midfielder our injured, if we have to bring Jimmy Garner back from Watford, use guys from the U-23‚Äôs &amp; U-18‚Äôs Pogba should never be in a United shirt again after this #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AskSmythsToys Hi, I get this is a very busy period for ye but I contacted ye this on Saturday because contacted ye on Facebook on Friday &amp; got no reply &amp; still haven‚Äôt a reply from either ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>9-3 #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a pick it was as well #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Savage INT that will do it #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>$105m worth every penny #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AARON FUCKING JONES!!!! LETS GO!!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If we lose this game #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is last year vs the Eagles all over again #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We were 23-3 up with 8mins to go &amp; somehow we could still lose this, I hate Pettine so much #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plays like that is why the Packers won't win the SB #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great tackle Jaire #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>400 TD's @AaronRodgers12 üêê #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Adams TD x2!! #GoPack<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>DAVANTE ADAMS #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Rashan Gray Sack!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can already feel there's no energy in this team #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good coverage there Kirksey #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This defense is gonna make Carson Wentz look like pre-injury Wentz aren't they ? #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cleveland Browns üò≥ #CLEvsTEN #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good finish that #TOTARS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a goal by Son #TOTARS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gaelic Football is an awful state #RTEGAA #mayovtipp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thought this game would be closer than yesterday but it could end being the opposite, Mayo ruthless but if their backline plays like they did in the first 15mins against Dublin they will shred them apart #RTEGAA #mayovtipp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And they get punished for it #RTEGAA #mayovtipp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tipp should have 2-1 on the board, two poor finishes #RTEGAA #mayovtipp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great defending Werner #CHELEE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get in Marcus!! Great finish &amp; what a ball by Mata #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People who don‚Äôt rate him are funny #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rashford has to finish that #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs an absolutely brilliant finish from Greenwood #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Greenwood!!! Get in!!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AskSmythsToys Hi I have a question about my PS5 pre-order can you let me DM you ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ste_malone I wish I was, as I said I only knew cause a family member told me at 9 yesterday about it, I got my order confirmation email before the actually notification about them being on sale<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ste_malone These went on sale last night at 10:30 loads of people including myself had a problem with the email notification service only for a family member seen something about I wouldn't have had a clue about it until it was sold out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ProBowlVote @RobTonJr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fucking stupid from Ole not taken him off #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We had the chances, we missed them &amp; that's probably the game #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Martial what are you doing ??? #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ole what are doing not taken off Fred ? #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please take Fred off #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Shocking. #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please Gute at least try get him #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IKE_Packers I think 4-1, Derrick Henry is gonna run all over us üòî<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParkerMoes should at least 12-4, not looking forward to the Tennessee game<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That game was 10pts closer than it should have been but still comfortable in the end #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>8-3 #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rodgers been still in the game and going for it there says everything you need to know about what LaFleur thinks of the defense #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why can't we ever just beat the breaks off a team we always have to make it look closer than it is ? #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do we always tackle by dragging the WR, TE or RB forward ? #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Williams Touchdown!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going for it on 4th down 34-10 up at home, lol #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big Bob Tonyan TD!!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Savage INT x2 #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Preston Smith!! Sack!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're 27-3 up at home with nearly a full half gone, playing against Mitch Trubisky &amp; I'm still nervous this is what Mike Pettine does to me #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoatAaronJones Strip by Z Smith &amp; P Smith ran it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PRESTON SMITH TOUCDOWN!!! OMG #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lazard!! Touchdown!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are the Packers not using Aaron Jones as much as they should be this season to drive his price down to try keep him cause that's only acceptable reason he's not on field except injury #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Savage INT!!! Lets go!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big Dog TD!!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good move EQ #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great play there by Greene &amp; King #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ADAMS!!! TD!!! What a catch #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bears on 4 game losing streak, have one of the worst offenses in the NFL but you can almost bet on the Packers defense making them real good tonight #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The next one not so much #NFL #KCvsTB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs a great throw by Brady to Goodwin tbf #NFL #KCvsTB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ronald Jones that's ridiculous footwork #NFL #KCvsTB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tyreek Hill 39 fantasy points in the first quarter üòÆ @NFLFantasy #nflfantasy  https://t.co/VlfHwe5TeZ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That's an unreal catch by Hill #NFL #KCvTB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Derrick Herny is the best RB in the league #TENvsIND #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üá∫üáæ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sideline-cuts should 2 points in Hurling like they are in Camogie its a ridiculous skill &amp; should be treated as such #RTEGAA #LimVGal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Joe Canning üëè #RTEGAA #LIMvGAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs some score by Cathay Mannion #RTEGAA #LIMvGAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheEuropeanLad Great composure on the ball, was disciplined when he had to defend the only criticism I‚Äôd have is he had a couple of times where he should have shot but decided to pass it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get in #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CAVANI!!!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rashford has to shoot there #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cavani!!!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He‚Äôs been awful so far today &amp; still pops up with a goal #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bruno!!! Come on!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>United please buy Ward-Prowse cause it‚Äôs the only way we‚Äôre ever gonna beat Southampton #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you miss a chance like that second chance it just might not be your day #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has there been a game recently where United haven‚Äôt conceded from a set piece against Southampton? #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@utdreport @JonathanShrager What if he gets injured again &amp; Tuanzebe suspended for PSG ? Also even if he was fully fit why does Ole keep forcing this partnership it doesn‚Äôt work<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamSchefter Why does the Ravens &amp; Steelers get rescheduled twice but Broncos have to play without a QB or forfeit ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jack Fagan has been unreal in the second half #KILKvWAT #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Mike McCarthy is playing Madden, that might be the stupidest play call I‚Äôve ever seen #WASvDAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chase Young is gonna be so good over next few years #WASvDAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going for it in a 10-10 game in the first half from your own half is interesting to say the least #WASvDAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can't convince me that play was planned #HOUvDET<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rtenews have to allow people to make their own decisions about what's best for them (2/2)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rtenews I'm not saying people should be throwing house parties &amp; bars &amp; restaurants should be opening at full capacity but when are we gonna let adults be adults &amp; asses their own risks if you don't wanna take the risk, if your high risk from getting you should stay home but you...(1/2)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>2020 does it again, RIP Diego Maradona<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wasn‚Äôt a great second half but that happens when your 3-0 up at HT. Delighted Dan James getting a goal at the end #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Dan James!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't really complain with that first half. Bruno being Bruno &amp; felt Van de Beek &amp; Cavani both played well in that first half #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>He's in debt to hundreds of millions &amp; he's still willing to pay $7.9m for a recount that isn't gonna change no more than a couple of hundred of votes in state where he lost by over 20,000.

<|startoftext|>Now this its becoming a borderline coup #Elections2020   https://t.co/EoHDKRVo3G<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Jesus he‚Äôs gonna start war before he leaves #DonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump is so petty man.

<|startoftext|>@IKE_Packers üáÆüá™<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Water breaks are ruining games Waterford were in the ascendancy now Limerick well back on top #LIMvWAT #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some start to the 2nd half by Waterford #LIMvWAT #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelFFlorio Do I start Rodgers or Herbert and do I start Landry, Claypool or Jefferson ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>End of that game is why the black card doesn't work every player is gonna take the black card in the last minute when there two points ahead #galvmayo #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shane Walsh that's an unreal score #GALvMAY #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mayo should be well out of sight in this #GALvMAY #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Richie Hogan üëè #KILKvGAL #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This setup to be a cracker of a final 15mins #CORvTIPP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Least he finally admitted a lose in one state baby steps I guess #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>James Lowe debut try!! üôå #IREvsWAL #AutumnNationsCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very good first half from Ireland. Great to see James Lowe in a Ireland shirt #IREvWAL #AutumnNationsCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ryanstruyk @Acosta @PressSec As an outsider watching this the way the media in America just laugh this sort of stuff of is scary why do people just assume he's gonna leave on 20th Jan cause that's what his predecessors have done remember Trump ain't like his predecessors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For fuck sake, can someone please explain to me why are international games are still being played ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's over, they know its over so I don't get why they're still allowing Trump to play this game he's playing #Elections2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sure this is totally legal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayMotty @realDonaldTrump Nah he's quoting this right, the guy gave a statement about ballot fraud then recanted it then recanted the recant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeardedGenius It‚Äôs a borderline coup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's appeasing Trump &amp; then there's this he's either insane or they actually have evidence of mass voter fraud it has to be one or the other #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden campaign needs to get more aggressive &amp; start challenging this BS by Trump #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This isn't good, I'd be worried if I lived in America #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even Fox are sick of this crap #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mkraju Lindsey Graham who 5 years ago would have start a war in every country that doesn‚Äôt have democracy now wants to take away ways of making voting possible for people in America you‚Äôd laugh if it wasn‚Äôt so serious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Donald Trump gone &amp; now a potential COVID vaccine 2020 is finally looking up #CovidVaccine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Herbert was not talked not enough before the draft he's so good #LVvLAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Herbert what a throw to Johnson #LVvsLAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kerry gone üò≥üò≥#CORvKER #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After 4 years of madness its nice to see a calm American president or soon to be president #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahahahahahahahahahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally something good in 2020 #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a tweet for everything #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gavreilly No matter margin we all know he's gonna cry foul<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I get he‚Äôs their Dad but Trump‚Äôs children need to stop this &amp; prepare him for the inevitable it‚Äôs over #Elections2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The magic wall has finally crashed #CNN #USElectionResults<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>6-2 #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mason Crosby from 53 with a bad calf, unreal #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Take Aaron Jones out of there #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Adams is just too good #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Touchdown MVS!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lewis touchdown!!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great. #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Packers have gotten an actual turnover #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>INT Raven Greene!! Let‚Äôs go!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fucking hell MVS #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Packers actually get a stop early #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Adams is absolutely ridiculous only Hopkins in current form is anywhere close to him #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Touchdown Adam!!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aaron Jones welcome back üí™ #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is unbelievable but not so unbelievable at the same time #USElection<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A Senator &amp; a former UN ambassador &amp; governor answering to Donald Trump's son is embarrassing #Elections2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a great look for the Democrats #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus Michigan counting is becoming messy #USElection<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And yes new manager won't solve all of United's problems but it can't hurt #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love Ole he's done some good things as United manager but its probably time for him to go #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Tony Martial!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's joke defending #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where was this in 2016 when he won Michigan by 10,000 votes ? #Elections2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was fully convinced Trump was gonna pull it out of the bag but those Michigan numbers don‚Äôt look good for Trump #Election2020¬†Ôøº<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even with all the mail in votes in Pennsylvania which will break democrats is there enough votes for Biden as Trump has 700k lead right now ? #USElections<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No matter the outcome of this election it looks like Trump &amp; Fox news are heading for a break considering what he's saying about them tonight &amp; over the campaign #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>John King excellent on CNN tonight üëè #Elections2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is becoming very 2016 #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Donald Trump is gonna win this #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump has Florida won and that means its gonna get interesting tonight #Elections2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wolf Blitzer needs to calm down on CNN #CNNelection #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know why I care about this election but for some reason I do #USElections2020 #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Joe Biden campaign seems to have already conceded Florida so tonight's gonna be interesting #Election2020 #USElections2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I get not trading for a WR but how can look at last Sunday not trading for someone to help stop the run ? #Packers #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the Packers are gonna give up a 2nd round pick for somebody it should be someone that can help stop the run not a WR #GoPackGo #Packers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden Campaign already giving up on Florida &amp; Pennsylvania? #Election2020 #USElections2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As I said many times before Trump is gonna win &amp; it‚Äôs not gonna be close as people have been saying #USElections2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EamonMelia ü§ûüôè<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wentz is talented but he makes so many stupid decisions #SNF #DALvPHI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That kick sums up the NFC East #SNF #DALvsPHI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a INT #SNF #DALvsPHI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh the NFC East #SNF #DALvsPHI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What was Carson Wentz doing ? #SNF #PHIvsDAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Least the Bears lost #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fairplay Drew Lock, he has talent just not consistent enoug #LACvsDEN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a TD wow #LACvsDEN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kareem Jackson out here tryna kill people #LACvsDEN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A.J Bouye just got knocked back into 2019 there by his man #LACvsDEN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayMotty I think Trump's gonna win hope I'm wrong though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okwuegbunam what a catch #LACvsDEN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Herbert is really tryna cost me fantasy today #nflfantasy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Justin Herbert is so good. Him and Burrow are on their way to being superstars #NFL #LACvsDEN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The first week I start Herbert he throws in INT of course #NFLFantasy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PackersHive No excuse bro they were missing their starting corners &amp; their 3rd corner got injured early<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pettine needs to go the Vikings game-plan like it is every time we play them is give to Cook &amp; yet still couldn't scheme anything up to stop him #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Adams what a catch #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The refs love Packers...#GoPackGO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow MVS actually made a catch when we needed him to #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vikings have one game plan give it to cook and we still can't stop it #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Packers are in trouble #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big Bob Tonyan!!! Let‚Äôs go!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck off defense #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bad feeling this is gonna be banana slip game #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Packers need another WR yes but what do they need more ? A run stopped #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dean Lowry sack!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Adams TD!!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great catch &amp; run AJ Dillon #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope Dantzler is ok, guy didn't even mover #MINvsGB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turned over right in time to see Dalvin Cook running all over the Packers #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>May as well enjoy the CL run this year cause we won‚Äôt be in it next season #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Play like that in the second half &amp; we‚Äôll lose #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Terrible first half from United #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>it*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The diamond isn‚Äôt working. United‚Äôs best formation is 5-3-2 we nearly always control the game &amp; play well when we use #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awful start from United #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good win in difficult conditions üíö‚ö™Ô∏èüíõ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's happening üëÄ #Elections2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nah leave Mason where he is #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You mean the one where you ancestor came &amp; kicked Irish people off their land, killed and jailed them for 800 years &amp; stood by let 1mil Irish people die in the famine. You can excuse me for not want acknowledge our 'shared history'<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>üëëüëëüëë #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Need to start picking up points in the league now starting Sunday #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First half was solid second half was excellent. Marcus Rashford what player &amp; what guy absolutely delighted for him #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rashford hat-trick!!! Get in!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good penalty Martial #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great finish Marcus!! Come on!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent little ball from Bruno as well #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Marcus!!! Fairplay to him for sticking it in the net &amp; not stopping #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs a goal #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was solid first half but need to get on the ball more. Leipzig will get chances in the second #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If that‚Äôs in PL it‚Äôs offside good to see UEFA using sense when it comes to VAR #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Mason!! Excellent finish!!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReginaDo @bbcradioulster Just wondering Regina have you paid  ‚Ç¨60,000 you owe to the revenue commission &amp; ‚Ç¨50,000 you owe to AIB ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeoVaradkar Over 58,000 have or had COVID, nearly 1,900 dead, over 200,000 currently on PUP, budget deficits for this year &amp;next will amount to ‚Ç¨40bn &amp;you‚Äôre doing a lap of honor on this very Donald Trump of you.

<|startoftext|>If Trump loses the election he‚Äôs not gonna just accept it not matter how big Biden wins by, it‚Äôs gonna be chaos in America #2020Election #Trump #Biden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I‚Äôm not even joking when I say this if Trump loses there might actually be a civil war in a America #2020Election #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NFLFantasy Not starting Herbert<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This game is mad #SNF #SEAvsAZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seattle have all the luck #SEAvsAZ #SNF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We‚Äôve got a game #SNF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As I said...#SFvsNE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I picked up James Robinson after Le‚ÄôVeon Bell got injured early in the season &amp; right now he's carrying my fantasy team #nflfantasy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Pats defense are gonna end up minusing me fantasy points today #nflfantasy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cam Newton is not good &amp; nobody can convince me otherwise #SFvNE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BAKER MAYFIELD!! #CINvsCLE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Baker Mayfield big throw #CLEvsCIN<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Jamaal Williams Touchdown!!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Preston Smith what a play!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clear hold there on Z Smith #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like MVS but you can't trust him to make catches when you need them #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent tackle by Vernon Scott #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are the Packers tryna make a game of this ? #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WTF was that ? #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Adrian Amos Sack!!üí™üí™ #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus that hit on Dalton was bad really bad. Hope Dalton is okay #DALvsWAS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pity Bill O'Brien isn't the GM anymore we could probably get him for a 7th rounder #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another good stop defense #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Davante Adams is top a 3 receiver in the NFL maybe even the best #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rodgers to Adams touchdown!!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rodgers to Malik Taylor!! Touchdown!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They missed the FG!! Let‚Äôs go!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also excellent pressure from P Smith #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Krys Barnes Sack!! What a find he‚Äôs been #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not another injury #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice catch Bob Tonyan #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another good stop D! Mad what can happen when you actually bring pressure once &amp; a while #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Za‚ÄôDarius Smith Sack!!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sternberger!! Touchdown!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That release from Adams üî•üî• #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs ridiculous from Rodgers &amp; Adams #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great pressure by Z Smith, great coverage by Greene &amp; another good stop defense #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>62 yard punt by JK Scott, unreal #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good stop defense #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Touchdown Adams!!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IKE_Packers üáÆüá™<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Van de Beek must be thinking why did I come to United ? #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was dreadful #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be great if we could hold on to the ball for a couple mins #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>O‚ÄôMahony‚Äôs offload üëè #IREvITA #SixNations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another good try from Ireland #IREvITA #SixNations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I‚Äôm not complaining about the line up but you can‚Äôt justify it by saying we beat Newcastle with it last week cause it was 1-1 till the subs came on #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brilliant from Ireland #IREITA #SixNations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right you might not agree with the likes of #SF, #SD, #P4P etc but seriously how can anybody vote for #FG, #FF &amp; #GP after this 4 months of chaos ? #Ireland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also someone needs to tell @DonnellyStephen that the largest testing lab in country is gonna be closed this weekend &amp; next weekend cause he just said the test &amp; trace isn‚Äôt collapsing when evidently it is #COVID19ireland #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonnellyStephen ‚ÄòSinn Fein need to decide if they accept NPHET advice or not‚Äô if Donnelly &amp; the Government had accepted NPHET‚Äôs advice nearly 3 weeks ago we‚Äôd be nearly finished the 2nd lockdown #Covid19 #Covid19ireland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wish the Packers were like this instead of keeping draft picks &amp; never showing any ambition besides tryna get to the playoffs every year #GoPackGo #Packers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOL @Vikings given up a second to get him only to trade him a month later for a third #NFL #Vikings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the first poll Trump has lead in Arizona, he's gonna win the election &amp; I'd be shocked if he doesn't #USPresidentialElections2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was there any need for that cheap shot from Josepha Madigan about Bobby Storey funeral ? Everything was good and civilized till that #TonightVMTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brilliant piece this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Obviously losing nearly ¬£120m in revenue is bad but the way some journalist we‚Äôre going on here leading up to the results United were about to be liquidated #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thought Tuanzebe &amp; Telles were excellent as well #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent performance tonight. United were the better &amp; deserved that. A lot of excellent performances but Fred MOTM for me #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ole delivers in a big game again #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rashford!!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rashford has to keep going there #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent first half from United. Can‚Äôt wait for 45mins of heart palpitations in the second half #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Bruno!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So what this lockdown essentially is so we can have a good Christmas not building up ICU capacity, not building up contact tracing, setting up testing at Airports. We‚Äôll open up in December &amp; be back here in January #COVID19ireland #COVID19 #Lockdown2 #level5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs some catch from Diggs #KCvsBUF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Philip_Ryan And are they gonna build hospital capacity this time ? or is gonna be we get numbers low for Christmas &amp; then in January we're back to another lockdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The cure is becoming worse than the disease #COVID19 #Ireland<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Philip_Ryan Instead of encouraging people to follow the rules &amp; bringing them along they‚Äôre scaring them into it, absolute disgrace @fiannafailparty @FineGael @greenparty_ie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Paris without the Eiffel Tower" Jesus these Liverpool Journo's really now how to be over dramatic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let‚Äôs just get out of this game with no more injuries #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Derrick Henry best RB in the league #NFL #HOUvsTEN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Baker Mayfield not good at football #CLEvPIT<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Bruno!!!! Get in!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent save from De Gea #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good response to going behind. Big for Maguire to get the equaliser. Need to kick on in the second half now #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Harry!!! That‚Äôs massive for him #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCoughlan19 Definitely lad, if he makes a mistake tonight he has to be dropped for Tuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hate moaning about line-ups but Maguire should not be starting after the week he‚Äôs had &amp; especially if he has knock also Van de Beek must be saying why the fuck did I come here ? #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not a big Baseball guy but Jesus 11 home runs in the 1st inning #Dodgers #MLB<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I get Covid is dangerous but eventually you have to let grown ups make their own decisions. The restrictions don't really work cause you get numbers down for a few weeks then they spike, we seen it back in March we locked down for two months the numbers went down for June &amp; July<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surprised it took this tbh for the Glazers &amp; Woodward to cash in on the masks #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@henrywinter @EFL @premierleague big impact but a lot of EFL were in financial bother or heading for financial bother before COVID &amp; PL can‚Äôt &amp; shouldn‚Äôt just bail them out all the time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@henrywinter @EFL @premierleague Maybe project big picture wasn‚Äôt the way to go about it but PL clubs can‚Äôt be &amp; shouldn‚Äôt be expected to hand over money to EFL clubs without getting something in return cause it will encourage clubs to continue bad financial mismanagement by EFL clubs cause yes COVID has had...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The adversity you put yourself through by not adhering to the protocols. @NFL @nflcommish you happy about your teams barging about this ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Trump had just done that type interview that Pelosi just did Democrats would be calling for him to be committed #NancyPelosi #TheSituationRoom<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkySportsNews I understand why people are frustrated but you can‚Äôt except PL clubs (most of it coming from the big6) to hand over ¬£350m &amp; then 25% of profits every year &amp; then them not get to dictate the terms of the deal.

<|startoftext|>It‚Äôs a disgrace the nations league which is a glorified friendly competition is still going ahead this year. The only internationals that should have been player between now &amp; Euro 2021 is the Euro 2021 qualifying playoffs #NationsLeague #InternationalFootball<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Welcome to Manchester United Facundo Pellistri üî¥ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know a lot of United fans aren't happy with window I'm not either but I do love the signings of Amad Traore &amp; Facundo Pellistri cause even before Covid spending 80mil+ on players was becoming unsustainable signing young, special talents is the way forward imo #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welcome to Manchester United Edinson Cavani üî¥ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welcome to Manchester United Alex Telles üî¥ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds like United all right #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this is nothing against Adam Traroe no doubt he‚Äôs a special talent but we need a RW now #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>United are a joke. ‚Ç¨30m on a guy whose 18 &amp; can‚Äôt come till January. We need a RW now not in January #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_scottsaunders The only thing I'm surprised about is he didn't wait till tomorrow or the day after like they usually do<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This Browns vs Cowboys game is wild so far 14-14 all, OBJ going off, strip sack great watch so far #CLEvsDAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryLineker Agreed but fans are allowed to be angry &amp; pissed off when their team loses 6-1 no matter who they are &amp; who they lose to also no club should have parasites for owners who've riddled the club with debt &amp; taken nearly ¬£2bn out of it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was embarrassing no one person is to blame but how can Ole survive this ? You've just lost 6-1 at home to the guy you replaced after he was sacked #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spurs 3rd game of the season. Is history gonna repeat itself ?   (2/2) #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>18/19 Awful transfer window, awful pre-season not properly prepared for the season lose 3-nil at home to Spurs 3rd game of the season. Mourinho gets sacked in Dec   20/21 Awful transfer window, no pre-season not properly prepared for the season losing 4-1 at home to  (1/2) #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Game over. #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs fucking pathetic from Lamela<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I‚Äôve defended Maguire so much but that‚Äôs fucking disgraceful #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MichaelFFlorio  1) Do I play Tyreek Hill &amp; if not do I replace him Jarvis Landry or Justin Jefferson ?  2) Do I start Jared Goff over Lamar Jackson cause he's playing the Giants ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NFLFantasy 1) Do I play Tyreek Hill &amp; if not do I replace him Jarvis Landry or Justin Jefferson ?  2) Do I start Jared Goff over Lamar Jackson cause he's playing the Giants ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All this is about is Cavani &amp; the Pellistri kid nothing new in this #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is that not what they want ? #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sheffield United have just spent ¬£23m on Rhian Brewster, Wolves spent ¬£40m on that Silva kid no one heard of until he joined them, Leeds &amp; Villa have outspent United so far has Covid not affected them as well ? They really believe fans are stupid #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whilst obviously an upgrade on Igahlo this Cavani signing reeks on panicking from Woodward. He's nearly 34 and only scored 7 goals last season. Happy to be wrong but I think is another one of Ed's transfer fails #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that's probably that deal dead so #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sam Darnold wow #TNF #DENvNYJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everything was going so well, hope I'm wrong but this is definitely gonna slow down our red hot offense #Packers #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just when the season was going so well ffs #GoPackGo #packers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus they couldn't even get that one over the line #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad we sacrificed the FA Cup to not get out of the champions league group &amp; attract all these great players that aren‚Äôt coming, trophies over top 4 always #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok it took a big deflection #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brilliant from Pogba #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beautiful little touch that by Van de Beek and not a bad finish either by Mata #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get in McTominay!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Susihelpdesk Just DM'd you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also on Dembele thing I hate it personally he's so injury even with the extended season he only played 9 games last season. I'd rather sign no one than a player that can't keep fit #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>United are unbelievable they want Sancho, Dortmund have said all along the deadline is 10th August &amp; the price is ‚Ç¨120m upfront so United wait until 29th Sept to bid &amp; its ‚Ç¨40m short of what Dortmund want #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LaFleur called an a great game. Second year in his offense has been great so far #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A lot of people talk about not getting a WR in the offseason but it‚Äôs criminal that run defense wasn‚Äôt addressed, long night ahead if that continues to happen #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Solid opening drive for the offense #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good start defense #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Russell Wilson is too good. I‚Äôm not even joking when I say this he‚Äôs so good, everyone knows he‚Äôs so good &amp; he still underated #DALvsSEA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly don‚Äôt how the Packers stop Kamara without Kenny Clark, I was confident thinking Clark would play but now that he‚Äôs out no so much #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DK Metcalf lol üòÇ fairplay to Trevon Diggs for not giving up on it #DALvsSEA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Philly are a disaster #CINvsPHI<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HailRodgers12_ There was to much talk about their problems &amp; not enough about our own we can barely stop the run with Clark so what chance do we have stopping it without him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Packers fans myself including talked to much about Lions problems this week &amp; not enough about our own, get ran over by the Lions so far #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This defense is gone back to the Dom Capers days #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great play from Lazard #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allforunited Are they though ? Relying on just one agent to bring in nearly all your players every year is a risky business in my opinion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It‚Äôs one thing your manager saying you need more players but when your own players are saying it then that‚Äôs something else #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wasn‚Äôt gonna say anything else after the game but there‚Äôs a lot of people saying we need a CB more than Sancho which is false we need them equally as much we were awful at the back today but what did we really offer going forward ? #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Buy a left back or a centre back or Sancho or all 3 it still doesn‚Äôt solve the problems United have. United will never challenge for a league until the Glazers &amp; Woodward are gone &amp; football people are in charge of the club #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That type of defending from Lindelof gets you a new deal at United #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get in Donny!! Come on!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fucking disgrace #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Dave! #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Another blinder from Woodward &amp; Judge #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course this is his takeaway from yesterday. I like Lazard &amp; MVS but Rodgers makes them look like weapons #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Aaron Rodgers. Davante Adams. #GoPacksGo #GBvsMIN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Defense has been bad today #GoPackGo #GBvsMIN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Touchdown Lazard!! #GoPackGo #GBvsMIN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably should of had a TD but that‚Äôs still a big catch from Lazard #GoPackGo #GBvsMIN<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Jaire with the Safety!! Let‚Äôs go!!! #GoPackGo #GBvsMIN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good to see the run defense is still bad #GoPackGo #GBvsMIN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Obviously would have been better to end with a TD instead of a FG but solid first drive from the Packers #GoPackGo #GBvsMIN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>United have done everything to protect Greenwood from the media he goes away with England once and now all this happens, is there a way United can stop England from calling him up for a while ? #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I for one am absolutely shocked that the British government isn‚Äôt living up to their word when it comes to Ireland. Ireland never learns when it comes to Britain they‚Äôve been lying to us for 800 years why did we believe this time would be any different #Brexit #Ireland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Oddschanger Unreal how many ex professional footballers don‚Äôt understand good squad depth. What happens if Bruno or Pogba get injured ? I think we‚Äôve all seen Lingard &amp; Pereira aren‚Äôt good enough to step in<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Everton signing their 3rd Midfielder in a number of days wonder where are they all gonna play cause you can‚Äôt have squad depth right ?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I‚Äôm not gonna pretend I‚Äôve seen loads of Van de Beek because like most the only time I watched him was apart of that Ajax run in the Champions League but if performs for us like he did in that run then he improves us #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welcome to Manchester Untied Donny Van de Beek üî¥üá≥üá± #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCoughlan19 I know lad I heard one of them on it yesterday signing Van de Beek means Pogba is off even though Raiola said last week he‚Äôs close to agreeing a new deal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is every team that can afford to have different options allowed to have them no questions asked but when it‚Äôs comes to United it‚Äôs ‚Äòdoes he improve them ?‚Äô or ‚Äòwhere does he fit in ?‚Äô#MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fairplay to the board for getting it done quickly but this doesn‚Äôt make efficient all of a sudden let‚Äôs just wait &amp; see at the end of the window how efficient they are with the rest of the deals they want to do #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a good, cheap &amp; easy deal to do but known United they'll want to pay the ‚Ç¨40M with installments of ‚Ç¨1M over 40 years #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichealMartinTD This is threading dangerous water &amp; it can not be allowed to happen!! @ICCLtweet is there anything ye can or any other civil liberties organizations can do to challenge this if it becomes law ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This summer is becoming so like Jose's last one at United, everything that can go wrong is going wrong #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fair play to the Bucks &amp; the rest of the NBA teams, actions always speak louder than words #NBA #NBAPlayoffs #NBABoycott<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unless De Gea is back to prime De Gea next season he‚Äôll be sold in the next 1-2 years in my opinion #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now add a re-trial to that #MUFC #HarryMaguire<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I predicted there would be toing &amp; froing for a few weeks &amp; then Bartomeu will resign &amp; Messi will stay but going by this it could be a matter of hours #Messi #Barcelona<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a ploy to get Bartomeu out #Barcelona #Messi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How see this going is, there will be a few weeks of toing and froing between Barca &amp; Messi then the board will force Bartomeu to resign and Messi will stay #Messi #Barcelona<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seen Sport Witness sharing some Spanish reports this morning but I thought its just the Spanish Media being the Spanish Media but this is actually happening, quality signing for Leeds tbf #LeedsUnited<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not really surprised this whole thing has been dodgy since the start. 4 days between the offences &amp; the trial, the trial only taken 1 day &amp; it only took 11mins to deliberate. Also it seems if his sentence is less than 3 years he can pay a fine &amp; not go to jail #MUFC #HarryMaguire<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jayus Phil Hogan gets around a lot doesn't he ? #golfgate #PhilHogan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Special.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A victory for football #UCLfinal #UCL #PSGFCB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's some defending from Kimpembe #UCLfinal #UCL #PSGFCB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beautiful ball from Kimmich there #UCLfinal #UCL #PSGFCB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PSG missing an awful lot of good chances #UCL #UCLfinal #PSGBayern<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Di Maria should bury that #UCL #UCLfinal #PSGFCB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surely British commentators continuing to call famous Irish sports people British is a wind up at this statge ? #TaylorPersoon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Davy Fitzgerald talking a lot sense there #RTEGAA #SaturdayGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The full story coming out now I see, if this is true then I don‚Äôt blame Maguire #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So what they‚Äôre saying is it wasn‚Äôt as serious as made out &amp; all they wanted was to make an example out of him cause he‚Äôs a famous footballler ? #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They just can‚Äôt help themselves they have to try &amp; turn everything back on SF they just can‚Äôt admit they were wrong without doing whataboutery. SF to them is like what Migrants are to Donald Trump they‚Äôre the problem not matter how bad I or we do #GolfGate #FineGael #FiannaFail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sevilla's record in the Europa League is actually ridiculous #UELfinal #SEVINT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lukaku üò¨üëÄ #UELfinal #SEVINT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I get the outrage but is anyone really shocked ? Politicians have and always will be the biggest hypocrites #golfgate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I‚Äôll almost guarantee we haven‚Äôt made a move for that Gabriel it‚Äôs just agents tryna force Napoli &amp; Arsenal‚Äôs hands #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Leipzig are so far out of their depth here #RBLPSG #UCL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a chance for Poulsen #RBLPSG #UCL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent header that from Marquinhos #RBLPSG #UCL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AskAIB Just DM‚Äôd you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shotongoal247 Be a lot closer to Liverpool &amp; City, be as competitive in the CL as possible &amp; win a trophy at the very least<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shotongoal247 Don‚Äôt think Sancho will be done &amp; I can‚Äôt name you a CB that‚Äôs out there that would be available that would improve our defense it‚Äôs why I think next season will be a struggle but hopefully I‚Äôm wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shotongoal247 RW, CB &amp; CDM to start<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shotongoal247 As I said it‚Äôs about signings Ol√© sent a message to board about what he thinks of the squad last night by not making subs till 5mins to go. If we get minimum 3 quality signings then yes we can push forward if we don‚Äôt then we‚Äôll regress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last night was disappointing but if you offered me at the start of the season we‚Äôd get 3rd &amp; go far all the cups with the squad we had I would have snapped your hand off. Ol√© achieved the board‚Äôs objective this season &amp; now they must back him with 3 quality signings minimum #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is pathetic even by the Mail &amp; Keegan‚Äôs standards #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All I can say we‚Äôre fucked next season without quality signings #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, fuck off #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Missing so many chances this is teeing up perfectly for a late Sevilla goal #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have to take these chances #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love Rashford but jesus sometimes he does my head in just shoot there #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They've been the better team they deserve that #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>United's ball retention is shocking #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brilliant penalty from Bruno #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Bruno!! Come on!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would have went for Matic over Fred but overall like as expected #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the money Pep has spent &amp; not even got to a Semi Final in his 4 years at City its ridiculous any other manager would be having questions asked about him #MCILYO #UCL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sterling how do you miss that ? #MCILYO #UCL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That Lyon keeper is a liability #MCILYO #UCL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really impressed with Aouar for Lyon looks like a proper player #MCIOL #UCL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh...#MCIOL #UCL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are today's case numbers worrying? Yes but according to the HSE Covid data hub they completed over 10,000 tests in the last 24hrs, I don't remember anytime during the period of March to June that they did over 10,000 tests in a day so context is needed #COVID19ireland #Covid_19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely embarrassing from Barca but Bayern are just so good can‚Äôt even see City stopping them from winning the Champions League this year #BarcaBayern #UCL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lewandowski is being robbed of a Ballon D'or this year #BarcaBayern #UCL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alphonso Davies üëèüëèüëè #BarcaBayern #UCL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bayern are just unbelievable #BarcaBayern #UCL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a goal, brilliant football from Bayern #BarcaBayern #UCL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This game is already so good #BarcaBayern #UCL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent goal that from Bayern #BarcaBayern #UCL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent finish that Pa≈°aliƒá #AtalantaPSG #UCL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That keeper man #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Bruno!! Get in!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Extra Time is the last thing we need #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The two weeks haven't done much for United still look knackered, maybe we should have sacked off Europa &amp; focused on next season #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't say its one of those nights #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He looks off #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor first 15 mins from United #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It‚Äôs mad that Laois are still locked down #COVID19 #Laois #Offaly #Kildare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonnellyStephen You mean 110 in Kildare 7 in Offaly 1 in Laois<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ronaldo isn't human #JuveLione #UCL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good header from Benzema #MCIRMA #UCL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Madrid all over the place at the back atm #MCIRMA #UCL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a load of BS if this spike was happening in Dublin the whole country would have to pay for it like we did at the start #Offaly #Laois #Kildare #COVID19ireland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love Tony but he‚Äôs 24 how‚Äôs he been nominated for young player of the year ? #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Secondly I don‚Äôt have a problem with a local lockdown but the hypocrisy around is what‚Äôs frustrating to me (2/2) #COVID19ireland #Offaly #Laois<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dublin has been the epicenter in Ireland for the whole of the pandemic &amp; there was never a suggestion of a local lockdown but a couple of rural counties (Offaly &amp; Laois) have a spike &amp; all of sudden its time for a local lockdown...(1/2) #COVID19ireland #Offaly #Laois<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting Sanchez off the wage bill is nearly bigger than any signing this summer. I was excited like most when he signed but it‚Äôs been a disaster #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Martial on a minute &amp; has already done more than most of the players  that started #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The drop in quality between the reagular starting 11 &amp; rest of the team is on show once again here #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FFS that's probably pens gone #BrentfordFulham #playofffinal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This playoff final has been awful watch think ever neitral that's watched this in full deserves the drama of a penalty shootout #BrentfordFulham #playofffinal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allforunited excited but now that they say something United fans don't like its now "bullshit" &amp; "media telling lies" #<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allforunited Very true but Dortmund are a different club to Sporting. I'm not saying the deal's not gonna happen what I am saying is that United fans can't pick &amp; choose what they want to believe from the media when they were saying yesterday that personal terms were agreed everyone was...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allforunited Or they could be telling the truth &amp; you just don't like ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don‚Äôt care that we‚Äôre giving Sanchez away the key is getting his wages off the books if we got a fee with it, it would have been a bonus #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If that's the case lets do the deal #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a red card for me #ARSCHE #FACupFinal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent finish that by Aubameyang #ARSCHE #FACupFinal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awful defending from Arsenal #ARSCHE #FACupFinal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This deal is right up Mourinho's street #Spurs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This probably means fans going back to football in October is over unless something dramatically changes between now &amp; then &amp; if fans can‚Äôt go back you have to wonder how teams in the lower leagues can survive this much longer #Football #Covid19UK #Covid19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolute chaos in the #Dail tonight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Van Der Saar saves it, its United again" what a night #ITV4 #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@btsportfootball His header vs Roma was miles better than the CL final one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ITV4 now what a roller-coaster of a night but what an unbelievable night it ended up being #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Josh Onomah üëè #CARFUL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love Ol√© me #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love to see it #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Credit to Ol√© &amp; Players after Burnley at home we were 7th &amp; looked dead &amp; buried to recover to finish &amp; get CL is an excellent achievement but it has to be a stepping stone the club needs to back Ol√© now in the window &amp; get quality depth in the squad #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get in Jesse!! Get in United!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jonny Evans once a red always a red #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Bruno!!! Come on!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus we were lucky there #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor first half from United. Offered nothing really going forward &amp; looked shaky at the back. Don't know if I can watch the second half #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's poor from Rashford #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We can't play from the back so why do we do it ? #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahh yes City unearthed a gem in David Silva the same David Silva that was playing for Spain for 4 years &amp; started the euro 2008 final before he joined them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YESSSSSS #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Championship is unrivalled for drama #BRENvBARN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some finish that by Josh Dasilva #BRENvBARN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How have been tried not scored there ? #BRENvBARN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>West Brom &amp; Brentford doing bigger bottle jobs than United at the moment #Brentford #WestBrom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>United look knackered again not resting players for games like Bournemouth &amp; Aston Villa has really done us in #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great bit of play between Greenwood &amp; Martial for that goal #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Mason!!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let‚Äôs be honest we ain‚Äôt winning this be lucky to get a draw now #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our most consistent player over the full season not playing the most important of the season bit of a weird one #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Keinan Davis should score there #AVLARS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>rather win a cup than be in a competition that we realistically aren't gonna win #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chelsea deserve that we were awful. Squad depth has to be addressed just cause our fully fit XI is excellent doesn't mean our squad is. Anyway considering where we were in January if we get top 4 which is all in our hands then it will be an alright season in saying I'd...#MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Embarrassing #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're passing like a very tired team #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Martial injured now FFS #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd say its only precaution but not great to see Bailly in a neck brace #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fourth time a Chelsea player has gone in from behind &amp; fouled a United player #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chelsea much the better team, United need to wake up #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's some finish from Kane #TOTLEI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How I am only seeing this now ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not even back in the league 5mins...#Leeds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The myth that Fine Gael have done a good job with #COVID19 continues #Ireland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üòÇüòÇüòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus that was some effort from Laporte, unlucky #ARSMCI #FACup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That City line was all over the place #MCIARS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a very good save from Martinez #ARSMCI #FACup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even though they're winning Arsenal are dancing with danger here with the way they're playing out of the back #ARSMCI #FACup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a good goal tbf #ARSMCI #FACup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ye claim that we only account for 8% of your business so do ye care so much ? #Ryanair<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Proving what United fans have been saying for years that the refs ref our games poorly so thanks Frank üëç #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just like Southampton were fortunate to not have Romeu sent off in the first half &amp; then fortunate that United used their 3 allotted sub spots so they had to finish the game with 10 men when Williams got injured ? #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thought Fosu-Mensah did well for a guy who hasn‚Äôt played for us for 3 years &amp; has played a professional game in over a year #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Robbie Savage relax #BTSport #CRYMUN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that Rashford, Martial, Bruno &amp; Pogba had to play every second is our biggest problem. Strength &amp; depth is a must this summer #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Weren't great but we'll take it. Rashford &amp; Martial again üî• #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent finish from Martial #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Tony!! Get in!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bruno you have to score that #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a tackle Maguire #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus we got lucky there #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That one's on Bruno what's he doing there #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awful first half from us lucky to be in the lead. We looked knackered &amp; Greenwood looks injured. Need to get a second goal early or this could be a long second half #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great little ball by Bruno to Rashford &amp; great dumpy by Rashford as well #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Marcus!! Get in!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>United need to score from of these corners #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate when we play at Palace always scrappy &amp; no rhythm to the game #CRYMUN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When was the last time he actually played for United ? #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fosu Mensah, wow #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I knew the Arsenal invincible team had a good few draws but didn't it was as many as 12. United 07/08, Chelsea 04/05, City 17/18-18/19 &amp; this current Liverpool team all better teams than it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCoughlan19 Lindelof the wrong side of the goal scorer, Matic two yards from the fella who got the flick on who he was to suppose to be marking so there‚Äôs lots blame of to go around for that goal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCoughlan19 We‚Äôve went from 12 in goals conceded to third &amp; 7 clean sheets to 11 with 3 games to go money well spent imo üòú<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nah that can't be Van Dijk I've been told he's the best defender ever &amp; that he never makes mistakes #ARSLIV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's some pen from Wood #BURWOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Didn‚Äôt care about much needed the public investment when they were posing austerity on us in the early 2010‚Äôs #Ireland #AppleTax<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If he wasn‚Äôt English they‚Äôd be saying he‚Äôs doing OK at best<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>7-0 down at Half Time, jesus #WIGHUL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@newschambers Don‚Äôt know why they‚Äôre so upset if Ireland only counts for less than 8% of Ryanair‚Äôs traffic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't wait for Thursday when Palace who haven't been arsed since the restart play like they are fighting to stay up #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only ourselves to blame #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Buzzing for the 1 hour thats gonna be added on #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It would be great if we could hold on to the ball for more than 5 seconds #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even though in the lead very poor first half from us #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two excellent goals from United #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tony!!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get in Marcus!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>United's inability to play out of the back is a joke #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Martial has to score that #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a great start from United #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyway least we know now where everyone stands, no fuck ups tonight United please #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All I'm going to say is:   1) Given them a fine is worse than no punishment as shows all they're really interested in is money   2) It's time to scrap FFP if bans aren't gonna be kept   #UEFA #CAS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I beg United for once tomorrow don't fuck it up #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Total collapse from Leicester #BOULEI<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Good header that from Alderweireld #TOTARS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kolasinc is awful #TOTARS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some strike tbf by Lacazette #TOTARS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Massive goal for Villa &amp; good finish as well #AVLCRY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Didn‚Äôt see the football today but just seen the results top 4 is most definitely now in our hands #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By the sounds of it they‚Äôve already gotten away with it #MCFC #CAS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jim White talking sense 2020 just gets weirder and weirder #TalkSport<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can‚Äôt be true I‚Äôve been told our defense is awful #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First 30mins wasn't great but after we got the 1st goal it was pretty comfortable from then on #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would have taken off Rashford not cause Martial is fuming but he just doesn't look right #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent finish Pogba!! Come on!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wan Bissaka you have to score that #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't deserve to be 2-0 up but we'll take it #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The power on that strike #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Greenwood!!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bruno has to score that #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We don't deserve that need to kick on now #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Bruno!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>United's passing has been dreadful #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck off John Moss #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't have a great feeling about this #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Good header that from Egan #SHUWOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Leicester are winning this #ARSLEI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never depend on Arsenal to do you a favour #ARSLEI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After that ending Chelsea's luck is just in for them to get Top 4 need to hope Leicester drop more points &amp; we can keep winning #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>How have City not scored ? #SOUMCI #MOTD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No we just beat City &amp; Chelsea 3 times, beat Spurs &amp; I think the first &amp; for a good while in the season the only team to actually get something off Liverpool but we haven't really done anything against the other big teams this season #MUFC #TalkSport<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a goal Che Adams #SOTMNC #MOTD<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Dominant win yesterday, Leicester &amp; Chelsea both losing today, we've closed the gap to 3 points. Everything just seems to be going to well for us at the moment you know a shit result is probably around the corner #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Consider the fixtures Villa &amp; Bournemouth have coming up that result probably keeps West Ham up #WHUCHE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chelsea need to stop buying attackers and buy some defenders #WHUCHE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good strike by Willian but awful keeping as well by Fabianski #WHUCHE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haha had to be Soucek #WHUCHE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's fucking ridiculous #WHU#WHUCHE #WHU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only 3 points off Leicester now, think we have a better chance of catching them than we do Chelsea #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everton are 100% gonna bottle this #EVELEI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pickford is awful #EVELEI<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Another excellent performance. Bruno brilliant, Pogba excellence as well but have to say Matic impressed me the most &amp; he was my MOTM #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great defending there by Williams #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent save De Gea #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bruno excellent once again #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Devastating counter attack, what a pass from Matic to send Greenwood away &amp; what a beautiful from Greenwood to setup Fernandes #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Bruno!!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very good first half from United. Completely in control. Everyone playing pretty well but have to say Matic in my opinion has been the best player in the first half. Early goal in the second half should finish this #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bruno!!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Such an unbelievable talent #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get in Mason!! Come on!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>United vs City in the Semis absolutely nailed on #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awful defending from Sheffield United #SHUARS #FACup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's terrible from Basham #SHUARS #FACup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HARRY!!! YES!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't wait to lose this on penalties #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is he hitting that low? #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They deserve that to sloppy, to passive &amp; could easily lose this from here #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In all seriousness we need to sharpen up or were gonna concede #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great clearance Godfrey üëÄ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another quality finish from Ighalo #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Ighalo!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To passive, changes needed in the second half or we are getting beat here #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gonna have to bring two of Martial, Rashford &amp; Greenwood on cause there's absolutely zero width in this team #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The lack depth in this squad especially in the wide positions is next thing Ole needs to address. When you take out Rashford, James &amp; Greenwood there's width at all #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Finally subs been made #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beautiful goal as well #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tony!! Hat-Trick!!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine if Pogba scored there #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Martial brilliant in that half. Felt we forced a little bit too much but overall very good first half. Early second half goal should finish it off #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tony again!! Get in!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I‚Äôm all for taking risk but we forcing it a lot here &amp; given a way the ball so easy #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I can see a complete Villa collapse coming #AVLCHE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awful defending from Chelsea for that Hause goal. The standard of defending in the Premier League was bad before the lockdown but somehow it seems to have gotten worse since the restart #AVLCHE #PremierLeague<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Joelinton has actually scored a goal #NEWSHU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good strike that from Richie #NEWSHU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's awful from Stevens #NEWSHU<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RCoughlan19 It's questionable one that could go either way but it's not a blatant dive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every one of these are pens<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>De Gea &amp; Maguire getting most of the criticism for the goal last night &amp; rightfully so but what was Luke Shaw doing ? Headers the ball 5 yards to a United player with Spurs players around him &amp; starts running up the field without United having clear possession of the ball #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never stops winging best thing we‚Äôve done post Fergie is getting rid of him #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If he started Pogba &amp; he got injured you'd be giving out saying he rushed him back #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bruno was excellent tonight was bit worried his form before the lockdown was the new signing bounce that he wouldn't be as good when the return happened but he was quality again #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably were just about the better &amp; definitely would have taken that after 75mins when were 1-0 down. I give Pogba a lot of stick but he definitely changed the when he came on &amp; was excellent #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was the chance #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's not a pen #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I know a lot of people are gonna be angry/upset that the #Packers didn't take a WR there but we did need a ILB so its a good pick #GoPackGo #PackersDraft #NFLDraft<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Packers coming into this draft has needs at WR, LB, OL, DL &amp; TE. So with our first 1st &amp; 2nd round picks we select a QB &amp; RB and also gave up our 4th round pick to get the QB.

<|startoftext|>America is just a different place all together #COVID„Éº19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>25% of all Irish #COVID„Éº19 are healthcare workers which suggest to me that rumor that there is a shortage of PPE is true &amp; is mad considering the #HSE claimed in a briefing yesterday they have spent ‚Ç¨250m on PPE #COVID19ireland<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheHerd @ColinCowherd AJ Green, Tyler Boyd, Joe Mixon and potentially John Ross if he can stay healthy &amp; you don't know who else they could draft. QB's have come into the league with a lot less weapons<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They‚Äôve been doing it for nearly a decade why would they change now ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The way #COVID19 is continuing to develop in Italy is frightening nearly 475 dead in the last 24 hours alone. No sign of new cases and deaths declining #CoronaVirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I‚Äôm often critical of @LeoVaradkar &amp; this government but they‚Äôve got everything right around #COVID19 in Ireland to this point but now this must introduce emergency legislation to suspended rents &amp; mortgage payments until we are on the other side of this #CoronaIreland<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What a finish from Greenwood #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Five mins ffs #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another quality performance from Bruno today #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cut it back to Bruno #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a great first 15mins from United but after that absolutely excellent. Big 45mins coming up #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>6 mins of injury time added no stoppages in that 6 mins &amp; the game finishes on the 78th minute. No words except hard luck to the @Offaly_GAA hurlers they were the better team &amp; deserved to win that &amp; to be in the final @OffalyTracker #OffalyAntrim #GAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a try by Wales #ENGvWAL #GuinnessSixNations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So people are still free to fly in here without checks but if you refuse to self quarantine they will force you &amp; I have no problem with people being force quarantined if they have symptoms but the whole purpose of it is defeated if people coming here aren‚Äôt checked #COVID„Éº19<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GetUpESPN Richard: If I'm starting to build a team today I'm taking Simmons but in 2-3 years it might be different conversation.

<|startoftext|>And this not me saying Biden can beat Trump cause I don't think he can I think whoever the nominee is gonna be beaten by Trump but Biden he has a better shot to beat him #SuperTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>America voted for an extreme right wing candidate in Trump in 2016 but a lot of believe a polar opposite socialist in Bernie Sanders can beat him this year. Ye really believe America has changed that much in 4 years ? #SuperTuesday<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That young Gilmour lad in the midfield for Chelsea playing really well so far #CHELIV<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In saying all that good to see Bruno get another goal. I have feeling if we somehow get Top 4 he‚Äôll be the guy to drag us there as for the De Gea I love the guy but he needs to sort himself out cause we have an excellent young keeper in Henderson waiting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I didn‚Äôt see the game but I see we missed the opportunity to close the gap one 4th to 1pt. The only thing United are consistent at this season is missing opportunities to close the gap on the CL Sports #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Job done, excellent performance from United #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Fred!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't complain with that first half, probably could start thinking about taking a couple players off and resting them for Sunday #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent finish from McTominay #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I have no problem with the canceling of the Ireland &amp; Italy game but if it was cancelled due to fears of traveling fans carrying the virus shouldn‚Äôt the Health Service ban all flights from Italy, China &amp; countries that have had big outbreaks of the #COVID„Éº19 ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is wrong with a time limited suspension of free movement of people whilst Europe tries to get a handle on this thing ? #COVID„Éº19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Arsenal, Spurs now Chelsea, Bayern love a game in London so they do #CHEBAY #UCL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chelsea all over the place at the back #CHEBAY #UCL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But I thought we can do things in the transfer market that other clubs could only dream of #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That would have been some goal by Muller if that went it #CHEBAY #UCL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great weekend of sport ending with Celtics &amp; Lakers #BOSvLAL #NBASundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a chance that was for Calvert-Lewin #ARSEVE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everton might be worse than Arsenal at the back now that's some achievement #ARSEVE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Arsenal awful at the back nothing new there then #ARSEVE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's some ball from Luiz #ARSEVE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent finish from Calvert-Lewin, some start for Everton #ARSEVE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two big wins for the @Offaly_GAA footballers &amp; hurlers. Massive double now header next week at home üíö‚ö™Ô∏èüíõ @OffalyTracker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In all seriousness another big win, we need start being consistent &amp; go on a run from here #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>France's six nations to lose now #WALvFRA #GuinnessSixNations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's some win for France #WALvFRA #GuinnessSixNations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It will be so typical of France to bottle this #WALvFRA #GuinnessSixNations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone that thinks that was a clear &amp; obvious knock on needs their eyes tested #WALvFRA #GuinnessSixNations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just when you thought Wales were building an attack to take the lead they get intercepted for a try #WALvFRA #GuinnessSixNations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All that play from Wales in the last 10mins &amp; no try points. Overall great game for neutral point of view, set up nicely for the second half #WALvFRA #GuinnessSixNations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wales getting killed physically and for pace so far in this #WALvFRA #GuinnessSixNations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was unbelievable from France pity the forward pass ruled it out #WALvFRA #GuinnessSixNations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>France has some serious pace in their attack, great to watch from a neutral #WALvFRA #GuinnessSixNations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haaland to Dortmund is basically a six month deal, someone is definitely triggering that release clause in the summer #Haaland #BVB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fernandes and Fred come on and all of sudden we can play around with the ball #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Martial probably should have shot himself there #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent finish from Martial #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Tony!!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The difference in quality in midfield when Fred and Fernandes aren't playing to when they are is astounding #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Instead of digging up old tweets from years ago the media &amp; #FG &amp; #FF should be focused on this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs some performance from Atalanta #AtalantaValencia #UCL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I haven‚Äôt been critical of Solskjaer on anything really but the night Rashford got injured I was &amp; now with good reason. He should have never played that game. I was cautiously optimistic we would make CL but with Rashford out for probably the rest of the season, we won‚Äôt #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeoVaradkar Also very worrying you didn‚Äôt remove Catherine Noone from the ticket after she used the N word.

<|startoftext|>Yes Harry!!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fernandes does cover a lot a ground doesn't he ? #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Minus having the lead that was an awful first half. Chelsea had a lot of chances &amp; if they get them sort of chances in the second half they will score one #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LeoVaradkar Sinn Fein have said that the comment doesn‚Äôt reflect the parties stance.

<|startoftext|>@LeeXMartin I actually believe they‚Äôd willing to take that risk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeXMartin I think they don‚Äôt want SF in government that much they might be prepared to do that on a short term basis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fine Gael &amp; Fianna F√°il will team up to prevent another election &amp; thus preventing another &amp; Sinn Fein from running more candidates #GE2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That exit poll üòÆ #GE2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>smaller left wing parties weren‚Äôt brave to run candidates outside of the big city constituencies (2/2) #GE2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope I‚Äôm wrong on this but I don‚Äôt think the left will make as much gains &amp; the reason for that is they didn‚Äôt run enough candidates. #SF were the only ones to run in each constituency &amp; in a lot of constituencies they should have been brave &amp; ran 2. Secondly,...(1/2) #GE2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Man I wish #SF were running more candidates.

<|startoftext|>That's not PI #SuperBowl #SFvsKC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just under 5mjns on the clock Patriots down 1 I feel like I‚Äôve seen this movie multiple times before #NFLPlayoffs #NFLWildCard #TENvsNE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Derrick Henry 53 rush yards &amp; 22 receiving on that drive alone üò≥ #NFLPlayoffs #NFLWildCard #TENvsNE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent first drive from the Titans #NFLPlayoffs #NFLWildCard #TENvsNE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a game, NFL playoffs are the best #NFLPlayoffs #NFLWildCard #BUFvsHOU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How did he escape that ?? Deshaun Watson is unbelievable #NFLPlayoffs #NFLWildCard #BUFvsHOU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Buffalo doing everything to cost themselves the game, they should have just ran the ball when they where in FG Singletary has been solid today #NFLPlayoffs #NFLWildCard #BUFvsHOU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How did Allen make that throw ? #NFLPlayoffs #NFLWildCard #BUFvsHOU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This game is mad #NFLPlayoffs #NFLWildCard #BUFvsHOU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Josh Allen‚Äôs has lost his head #NFLPlayoffs #NFLWildCard #BUFvsHOU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just when you thought it was over #NFLWildCard #NFLPlayoffs #BUFvsHOU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big momentum change towards the Texans #NFLPlayoffs #NFLWildCard #BUFvsHOU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was a great throw by Allen pity the penalty wiped it off #NFLPlayoffs #NFLWildCard #BUFvsHOU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought he was just short but when it‚Äôs that close they usually go with the ruiling on the field so no surprise they gave it. Great effort by Watson to get it #NFLPlayoffs #NFLWildCard #BUFvsHOU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is really close, think Watson might be just short #NFLPlayoffs #NFLWildCard #BUFvsHOU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just throw it away Deshaun Watson #NFLPlayoffs #NFLWildCard #BUFvsHOU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is going on ??? #NFLPlayoffs #NFLWildCard #BUFvsHOU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great first half from the Bills #NFLPlayoffs #NFLWildCard #BUFvsHOU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs a great throw from Allen and not a bad catch either by Williams #NFLPlayoffs #NFLWildCard #BUFvsHOU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watson sacked 4 times already üò¨ #NFLPlayoffs #BUFvsHOU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a start by Buffalo #NFLPlayoffs #BUFvsHOU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a run by Josh Allen #NFLPlayoffs #BUFvsHOU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even though the Packers are on the bye &amp; aren‚Äôt playing till next week I‚Äôm buzzing for these playoff games tonight &amp; tomorrow #NFLPlayoffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that was bad #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fred has improved a lot recently but why is he on set pieces he always sky‚Äôs them #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs a pen, seriously what is the point of VAR if it‚Äôs not gonna overrule the refs ? #MUFC #WOLMUN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great save Romero #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hat trick of Wins today for Offaly, 3 wins out of 3 for both the senior footballers &amp; hurlers. Obviously still very early the season but it‚Äôs a very good start üíö‚ö™Ô∏èüíõ @Offaly_GAA @OffalyTracker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stop the maniacs #NoWarWithIran<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The level of disrespect Za‚ÄôDarius Smith is getting this year is ridiculous #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep I agree David #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another good win #ThunderUp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How‚Äôs that whole ‚ÄòWe elected Donald Trump cause we‚Äôre sick of endless wars in the Middle East‚Äô working out ? #Iraq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Messiah on Netflix is a very good watch would to recommend to anyone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I‚Äôve backed Solskjaer 100% but he‚Äôs lost me on this one #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Arsenal will finish ahead of us #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you can‚Äôt break down a team that has David Luiz at the back then you might as well give up #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is so typical of United #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is ridiculous #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Luke Shaw playing shite that‚Äôs unlike him...#MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Then maybe when he was suppose to be recovering from this so called ankle injury the first time instead of playing basketball in America then this would be more believable. Can‚Äôt wait till he leaves #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember your not allowed to say anything about Pogba because if you do then your a racist or have an agenda #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jahanbakhsh üëè #BHACHE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now there‚Äôs 1 million &amp; one reasons why you shouldn‚Äôt listen to these ü§°<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has there ever been a more dysfunctional franchise in sports than the Cleveland Browns ? #Browns<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When a college coach from a good program not a great program declines you for a potential job with a lot less talented team in the Giants you know your in trouble #Browns<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willcain @danorlovsky7 Dak was 1-6 against playoff bound teams &amp; 2-7 against .500 or above teams<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwordsMUFC Yeah I think 49ers defense will carry them to the SB but I just think Baltimore offensively are so unpredictable it‚Äôs hard to stop them &amp; their defense is very good as well. I can‚Äôt wait  for it all now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What does this even mean???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can‚Äôt get over how they miss that PI call in saying that how allow Seattle that delay of game from the 1 yard line is beyond me as well #SNFonNBC #SFvsSEA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nah he‚Äôs short, that stupid delay of game cost Seattle #SFvSEA #SNFonNBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This Seattle team is so reminiscent of 2013-2017 Packers. They have generational QB talent but the defense can‚Äôt stop anybody #SFvsSEA #SNFonNBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwordsMUFC And I think Baltimore will win it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep Seattle get yourself back into the game &amp; then give up a play like that #SFvsSEA #SNFonNBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Russell Wilson stop that, that‚Äôs an unbelievable pass #SFvsSEA #SNFonNBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwordsMUFC From the AFC I have Baltimore &amp; in the NFC my heart says the Packers are gonna somehow make it but my head says 49ers, who do you have ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the 49ers score a TD on this drive this game could get ugly #SFvsSEA #SNFonNBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a beauty of a punt from Dickson #SFvsSEA #SNFonNBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a Packers fan really want the Seahawks to win this for obvious reasons but I just can't see it happening #SNFonNBC #SFvsSEA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good win #ThunderUp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cleveland didn't even wait till Monday üòÇ #ClevelandBrowns<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My two coach of the year candidates are LaFleur &amp; Flores. LaFleur because any rookie HC that goes 13-3 in his first season deserves a nomination &amp; Flores cause he got 5 wins 2 of them coming against playoff bound teams with a team that was trying to go 0-16 #NFL #CoachOfTheYear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's the game for Philly #PHIvNYG #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Carson Wentz is so good &amp; to think people thought Eagles should keep Nick Foles instead of him #PHIvsNYG #nfl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs unreal from Saquon #PHIvsNYG #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Goedert what a catch #PHIvsNYG #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's an excellent throw from Jones and not a bad catch either from Tate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's some throw by Wentz #PHIvsNYG #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a catch that was by Golden Tate #PHIvsNYG #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With the OL getting banged up &amp; Lazard getting hurt as well it was so important we got bye #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I've calmed down a bit now, Packers just can never give their fans an easy rideüòÖ #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He deserves this one #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>13-3 ‚úÖ NFC North Champs ‚úÖ First Round Bye ‚úÖ No.1 Seed ‚ùì  #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LETS GO!!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AARON JONES!!! WHAT A PLAY #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do we keep going deep it isn't working ??? #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn Lazard is hurt #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good return from Ervin #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good hold defense #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know if I can watch the rest of this #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lazard!!! Let's go!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought he had it for a second #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blake INT!! Let's go!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only thing that's worked for the Packers has short, quick passes with some runs mixed why move away from it ? #GoPackGO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good stop defense #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great drive from the Packers #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Adams!! Touchdown!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you fucking kidding me!!!??? #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so f*cking frustrated right now, you have chance to get a bye, maybe the first seed if other results go your way, your playing a team that has a long list of injuries &amp; you play like this #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By the looks of it the Packers wanna play next week #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another good stop by the defense #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's coming back #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Packers get all the calls #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great second effort from Aaron Jones #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent return from Ervin #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FFS #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting killed on the run early #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jimmy Graham you have to catch that #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good stop on 3rd down #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnitedPeoplesTV Yeah they didn't want to put in a release clause and let him &amp; Raiola have all the control, correct decision imo. We have Rashford, Greendwood &amp; Martial, were good for world class potential forwards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HailRodgers12_ #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never depend on Arsenal to do you any favours #ARSCHE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know De Gea has made some howlers recently but that's just awful #ARSCHE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus that's awful from Leno #ARSCHE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Won‚Äôt say the tide has turned yet cause they still haven‚Äôt won any trophies but Rangers are very close to Celtic. Reckon if not this year next year they will win the league #OldFirm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In saying that give me the Old Firm 3/4 times year over 95% every other football game #oldfirm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Old Firm proving once again it‚Äôs the only good thing about Scottish Football #oldfirm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wft is with all the commercial breaks tonight ? #CLEMvsOSU #CFBPlayoff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Momentum all with Clemson going in the second half #CLEMvsOSU #CFBPlayoff #FiestaBowl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@630mrVip Dunno but it‚Äôs BS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trevor Lawrence wow #CLEMvsOSU #CFBPlayoffs #FiestaBowl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great cut on that run by Etienne. Clemson needed that #CLEMvsOSU #CFBPlayoff #FiestaBowl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That targeting call is a bad call #CLEMvsOSU #CFBPlayoff #FiestaBowl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs some move by Hill #CLEMvsOSU #CFBPlayoff #FiestaBowl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great start for Ohio State #CLEMvsOSU #CFBPlayoff #FiestaBowl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is ridiculous üòÆüòÆ #CFBPlayoff #CLEMvsOSU #FiestaBowl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was an unbelievable catch by Wilson #CLEMvsOSU #CFBPlayoff #FiestaBowl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Joe Burrow: 21/27  7 TD‚Äôs  403 yards   In the first half absolutely ridiculous #CFBPlayoff #LSUvsOU #PeachBowl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Game over, this is gonna be a blood bath #CFBPlayoff #LSUvsOU #PeachBowl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs probably the game, this LSU offense looks unstoppable #CFPlayoff #LSUvsOU #PeachBowl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is that not pass interference ? #CFBPlayoff #LSUvsOU #PeachBowl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3pts ‚úÖ Good away Performance ‚úÖ Clean Sheet ‚úÖ  Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YES Rashford!!! That seals it!! Come on United!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This has 6mins to be added &amp; Burnley to score the equalizer in the 95th written all over it #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For a team that‚Äôs suppose to be good on the counter attack our decision making on it today has been poor #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mike Dean is itching to make this all about him which really shouldn‚Äôt be a surprise to anyone #MUFC #BURMNU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They‚Äôre really growing into this now, there‚Äôs gonna be such inevitability about theequalizer if they get one #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good save De Gea #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is that not a red ? #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Deserved lead for United at half time #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Tony!!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brandon Williams is better than Shaw in every department. He‚Äôs quicker, fitter, defensively better, more calmer on the ball, 10 times better going forward &amp; he has a brilliant cross in him #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great weekend of sports ahead:  üîòCollege football playoffs  üîòPackers have a chance to guarantee the 2nd seed &amp; if results go their way the 1st   üîòOf course the inevitable bad United results will ruin it all of course<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great finish that from Mooy #BHABOU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reminder for all that VAR wasn't the problem with that Brighton goal being disallowed its the offside rule #BHABOU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep not a mad prediction at all, nearly nailed on this to happen now #PepGuardiola<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great...#MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good win &amp; much needed after Watford #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pereira has to look across the line &amp; give that to Greenwood #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Tony!! Now let‚Äôs put them to the sword! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Rashford!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mason Greenwood üëèüëè #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Tony!! Come on!  #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a shock...#mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don‚Äôt get why people are upset Pogba isn‚Äôt starting, he‚Äôs just back from 3 months off, we have 3 games in 6 days &amp; if gets injured the same people upset he isn‚Äôt starting would be slating Ole if he got injured #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The rule is the problem not VAR #TOTBHA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time to watch a load of #NBAXmas for the rest of the day, #MerryChristmas to all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wide Receivers be more like Michael Thomas not OBJ or AB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeemyHablo @FTFonFS1 @undisputed It‚Äôs not just Skip tho it‚Äôs the media as a whole. Cowboys won the SB in 1995 since then they‚Äôve won 4 playoff games &amp; the media give them attention like their some elite team that compete in the playoffs every year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üíöüíõ #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today on @FTFonFS1 they did 6 segments on the Dallas Cowboys this morning by my count &amp; I‚Äôm sure @undisputed will do at least 2-3 segments. I will never understand the media‚Äôs obsession with such a mediocre team #Undisputed #FirstThingsFirst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love this guy üíöüíõ #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Kenny Clark!! Sack!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes G-Mo on the 2pt conversion! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aaron Jones!! Touchdown!! Let‚Äôs go!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This defense is playing so good! Pity the offense can‚Äôt play half as good #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kevin King INT!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big Z again!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With all the turnovers to be behind by only 1 I‚Äôll take it. I feel like I‚Äôm repeating myself nearly every week now but her offense has to be better #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3 and out there‚Äôs a shock #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This not the Packers night #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We need a touchdown on this drive #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big Z!! Sack!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gifted the Vikings 10 points #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shit #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Defense play excellent so far #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a play there by big Z #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You already know it‚Äôs gonna be a long night #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brett Hundley has done something good for the Packers, finally #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What can go wrong will go wrong üòÇüò≠ #DALvsPHI #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good call on excellent pass coverage by Sidney Jones #DALvsPHI #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If that‚Äôs DPI then I give up #DALvsPHI #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nooooo, it was stating to look good for the Packers üò≠ #GoPackGo #ARIvsSEA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs a turnover imo #DALvsPHI #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not exactly a classic so far #DALvsPHI #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kyler is great, he's been having a great rookie year and isn't getting the credit he deserves imo #KylerMurray #ARIvsSEA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a throw that this from Wentz. He‚Äôs really starting return to his best the in the last few games #NFL #DALvsPHI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a start for Arcega-Whiteside #DALvsPHL #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just seen the video on Gary Neville talking about racism &amp; had to laugh at SKY ‚Äò They‚Äôre the views of Neville &amp; not SKY Sports‚Äô there‚Äôs no debate your either a racist or not &amp; if you claim not to be racist &amp; don‚Äôt call it out when you see it then you are racist #garyneville<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Baker just got away with another one there #NFL #BALvsCLE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don‚Äôt know how many times I‚Äôve said this, this season but Lamar Jackson is unbelievable #NFL #BALvCLE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs some catch from Harris #NFL #BALvCLE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Baker just got away with one there #NFL #BALvCLE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs an awful call on Odell, unsportsmanlike conduct penalties maybe the worst of all the penalty calls in the NFL #NFL #BALvCLE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great finish from Willian #TOTCHE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I give Pogba a lot of criticism but have to say he‚Äôs been excellent since coming the only creative spark we‚Äôve had today #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was so inevitable #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that was bad even by our standard in recent years #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That chip is so hard to do Jesse has to try put that either side of the keeper #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Harris just had the game in his hands #LARvSF #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs a nice throw from Goff #NFL #LARvsSF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don‚Äôt know about that flag #LARvSF #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Allen hasn‚Äôt been great tonight but he‚Äôs dropped 3 absolute dime passes #NFL #BUFvsNE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was an excellent throw from Allen but Brown ran a route just as excellent #BUFvsNE #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bills have to be delighted to be tied at half time #NFL #BUFvsNE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs a hell of a throw from Allen #BUFvNE #NFL<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@villa_vernon @AVFCTransTweet It‚Äôs same old same old<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh Jamies #NFL #HOUvTB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@villa_vernon @AVFCTransTweet Yeah my apologies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was a wild first half #NFL #HOUvTB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This game man #NFL #HOUvsTB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is ridiculous #NFL #HOUvTB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How nice of Jamies to give Houston all these gifts #NFL #HOUvTB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ronald Jones II what a run #NFL #HOUvTB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jamies gonna Jamies #NFL #HOUvsTB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3 NFL games on a Saturday ? Yes please #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnesta11 @AVFCTransTweet Yeah I get that but ye shouldn‚Äôt be letting so many players walk the best recipe for a newly promoted side to stay up is usually keeping the bulk of the squad together with some added quality on top &amp; if you stay up build for there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@b31avfc I agree, if you read my second this not personally about Dean Smith‚Äôs coaching I actually think he‚Äôs a good coach it‚Äôs more about the media‚Äôs double standard for English coaches vs Foreign coaches<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCoughlan19 I‚Äôm the opposite I seen Fulham 2.0 when I seen who they signed. Of course when you get promoted you have to spend to try stay in league but there‚Äôs a fine balance. Wolves last year &amp; Sheffield United this year got that right, Fulham last year &amp; looks like Villa this year didn‚Äôt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this not a knock on English coaches there‚Äôs some excellent English coaches in the Premjer League, Chris Wilder, Eddie Howe &amp; I don‚Äôt think Dean Smith is bad Coach this just about the double standard around managers &amp; calling for them to be sacked #AVFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aaron Villa are just like Fulham last year, got promoted, spent a load of money &amp; now struggling the only difference is that they have an English coach &amp; no wants to criticize an English coach. If their was foreign coach not English they‚Äôd be calling for his head #AVFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I‚Äôm not defending them because I think ‚Äòfancams‚Äô &amp; ‚Äòfan channels‚Äô as a whole are a load of shite but to #AFTV say are a remotely responsible for what‚Äôs wrong with Arsenal is a load of bollocks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He‚Äôs probably not the manager he was 4-5 years ago but Ancelotti is still some appointment for Everton #Ancelotti<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a win for the Bucks #NBA #lakersvsbucks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Giannis &amp; the Bucks shooting has been really good &amp; really impressive tonight #NBA #lakersvsbucks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good 3rd quarter from the Lakers #NBA #lakersvsbucks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent first half from the Bucks #NBA #lakersvsbucks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkySportsPL @DarrenBent Drogba over Rooney üòÇüòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep sounds like the DUP alright<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCoughlan19 True üòÇ but it‚Äôs Arsenal one minute they cry broke the next they are paying ¬£72m for Pepe so who knows<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCoughlan19 Apparently they want between ¬£1-2m which I think is a bit much for an assistant coach<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs worse that Arsenal won‚Äôt pay the money for a guy who they clearly want to be their next manager or the fact that City are asking so much for an assistant manager ? #Arsenal #Arteta<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was always gonna happen #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Tony!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought it was Maguire but it was Matic with the ball still good all the same #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent ball from Greenwood for that goal #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Marcus!! Good ball from Maguire aswell #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same old problems for United in that first half #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely ridiculous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EamonMelia They deserve some much needed time off from doing nothing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Private Banks: We got you covered   Private Kids Cr√®ches: No that would be reckless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #ProBowl has turned into the NBA All Star game its not the best players of that year that go its the fan favorites that are usually the same players every year with exception of 1 or 2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact @Showtyme_33 @PrestonSmith94 &amp; @TheRealZSmith didn‚Äôt get selected for the Pro Bowl just goes to show how it is pointless #ProBowl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkySportsNews Do they know that he‚Äôs good friends with Erdogan whose killing Kurds everyday ? √ñzil is a hypocrite<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Astonishing how may United fans stop defend this guy #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚ÄòWe‚Äôll have FFP all over us if we don‚Äôt stay up then maybe don‚Äôt spend over ¬£100m when you can‚Äôt afford to‚Äô #AVFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs friend‚Äôs Erdogan you the guy whose slaughtering the Kurds ? #Ozil<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some goal from Zaha #CRYBHA #MNF<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Packers back in the playoffs! Let‚Äôs go!! üíöüíõ #GoPackGo¬†#ThePackIsBack<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mad ending #ATLvsSF #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That looks a TD, they surely have to review that #ATLvsSF #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don‚Äôt know if he got that #ATLvSF #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the raiders lose their final game in Oakland even though they shouldn‚Äôt be leaving Oakland #JAXvsOAK #NFL<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ParkerMoes It‚Äôs the Cowboys so let‚Äôs wait until there‚Äôs 0 seconds left on the Clock in the 4th quarter<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Kyler Murray is low key having a very good rookie year #NFL #CLEvsARI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kyler Murray what a run #CLEvsARI #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2nd half the offense gets two TD‚Äôs &amp; then does nothing for the rest of the game. You can‚Äôt win in the playoffs playing offense like that shoot probably can‚Äôt win playing like that next week against the Vikings (2/2) #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you‚Äôd have offered me the Packers would be 11-3 with a new head coach at this point in the season I would have snapped your hand off so I‚Äôm don‚Äôt wanna &amp; not trying to be negative but this offense is concerning. As you seen on the first two drives of the (1/2) #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>11-3 #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another big stop by the defense!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Packers are really gonna let the Bears drive this 95 yards aren‚Äôt they ? #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great Punt JK #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another chance missed to finish this game #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DEAN LOWRY!! INT!! LETS GO!!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big let off there #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@talkSPORT @Sjopinion10 In the NFL you can get the game pass which is ‚Ç¨160 for the year &amp; you get every single game live Premier League needs to start doing something similar<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ffs #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FFS Tramon #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Great throw by Rodgers as well #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>KUMEROW!! LET‚ÄôS GO!!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DüöÇ comes up with another stop!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is our first drive of each half in nearly every game great &amp; then after that it‚Äôs a struggle ? #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aaron Jones!! Touchdown!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Adams with a big gain!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Defense great  Offense bad   #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What was that ? #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you god for Tyler Ervin #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rashan Gary!! Sack!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another good stop by the defense! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Damn...#GoPackGo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Solid return by Ervin on that punt return #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Arsenal are so bad you know what that means United will draw/lose to them in 2 weeks when we play them #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2 wins from 2 in the football   2 wins from 2 in the Hurling  Good start to season for Offaly üíö‚ö™Ô∏èüíõ  @Offaly_GAA @OffalyTracker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>United‚Äôs inability to break down teams that are sitting back is ridiculous! I‚Äôm Solskjaer in but are whole game plan can‚Äôt be just counter attack we have to be able to breakdown teams that‚Äôs sit back cause you play more teams like that than City or Spurs #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get in Greenwood!! Come on!!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Typical United #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone knew this was gonna happen #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two good chances missed there from Rashford and James #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs unbelievable from Leinster!! Come on!! #LEIvNOR #JoinTheRoar #ChampionsCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Garry Ringrose!! Great start for Leinster #LEIvNOR #ChampionsCup #JoinTheRoar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We can go 2 points off 4th tomorrow with a win so that means we‚Äôll lose #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Tories are gonna win the #GeneralElection in the UK the English are just like us Irish they suffer from Stockholm Syndrome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big mention for Greenwood tonight, the kid is special #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First half was awful second half was excellent, through top of the group! Come on United!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another one for Mason!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get in Mata! That should be 3 points &amp; top of the group #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That lad Greenwood!! Get in!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great goal from Young now kick on &amp; finish this game #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Ashley Young!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that was bad much better second half needed #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If United would have put any sort of effort in against West Ham they would have won, you put any pressure on them &amp; they collapse #WHUvARS #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just like West Ham deserved the lead to deserve to go behind they should have scored at least another by now &amp; didn‚Äôt #WHUvARS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hasn‚Äôt been a great game but West Ham have been the better team &amp; deserve that #WHUvARS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dead üò≠üòÇüòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a play by Breeland #KCvsNE #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Steelers who are on their 4th choice QB, who traded AB &amp; lost Le‚ÄôVeon Bell in the offseason, who haven‚Äôt had JuJu &amp; Conner for a lot of the season cause of injury are 8-5. Mike Tomlin is the Russell Wilson of coaches most under appreciated coach in the league #Steelers #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Patriots don‚Äôt get a couple of calls &amp; everyone is losing their minds, welcome to NFL New England it happens to everybody #KCvsNE #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lol @ New England fans complaining about the refs #KCvNE #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm guessing that INT is the receivers fault #KCvNE #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see the good Jamies Winston turned up this week the same week my fantasy opponent has him #FantasyFootball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>George Kittle is unbelievable #SFvsNO #NFL #49ers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm starting to worry about the Packers if they continue to play the way they've been playing post bye they'll get smoked by any team they meet in the playoffs except maybe Dallas #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>10-3 #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus that‚Äôs some catch üò° #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aaron Jones, unreal #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know he was down but Allison is so bad, that's the 3rd or 4th time this seasons he's had a play like that #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a throw from Rodgers and great catch from Jones #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the Packers punt...#GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Za‚ÄôDarius Smith is down, great #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can these WR's get open please ? #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sack!! Kenny Clark!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Packers convert on 4th down #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another nice run from Jones #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Packers winning but not a great game, if they were playing a better team it would probably be a different story. The offense is ugly to watch at times #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amos!! INT!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Packers blown coverage on 3rd down nothing new there #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think that‚Äôs gonna be overturned #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aaron Jones with a big run!! Let‚Äôs go!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Preston Smith!! Sack!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Touchdown!! Robert Tonyan!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was such a weird sack #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the first two drives from Washington are anything to go by Packers will get a lot of sacks today #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amos!! Sack! üí™ #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aaron Jones! Touchdown!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kenny Clark with the sack! üí™ Good start for the defense #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LSU correctly the no.1 seed #CFBPlayoff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If this is true it doesn‚Äôt surprise me, if I was Cleveland I‚Äôd trade in him heartbeat he‚Äôs not worth drama. No player has ever lived off one play as much as Odell has off that one hand catch #Odell #ClevelandBrowns<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Celtic were dreadful, played 30mins with 10 men &amp; still won. The gap might have closed but its still huge #OldFirm #RANCEL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hon the Celts üëÄ #oldfirm #RANCEL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Give me the Old Firm over 95% of the non-United premier league games #oldfirm #RANCEL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Celtic all over the place at the back #OldFirm #RANCEL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a save that was from Fraser Forster #oldfirm #RANCEL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unreal cross from Maddison for that goal #AVLLEI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everything about that goal was pure Jamie Vardy, the run in behind, the scrappy finish &amp; then the celebration #AvlLei<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How did El Ghazi miss that ?? Excellent game so far #AvlLei<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If LSU aren‚Äôt ranked no.1 it‚Äôs rigged #CFPlayoff #LSU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If LSU isn‚Äôt ranked no.1 then it‚Äôs rigged the only way Ohio State should be ranked no.1 is if they put on a show against Wisconsin &amp; beat them by 40+ #SECChampionship¬† #Big10Championship #LSU #ohiostatefootball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Joe Burrow won the Heisman against Alabama &amp; tonight he will probably book his place as maybe the no.1 pick definitely the first QB taken #SECChampionship #JoeBurrow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We paid ¬£45mil for Wan-Bissaka &amp; I know it‚Äôs early in his United career but I think we ripped Palace off #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How did Joe Burrow get away from that ? #SECChampionship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MOTD two matchdays in a row, it‚Äôs been a while #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow the pass protection that touchdown was unreal #SECChampionship<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>David De Gea üëè #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wan-Bissaka unreal #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent blocks from Lindelof &amp; Wan-Bissaka but this is gonna be a long half hour #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why didn't he give it to James ? #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dreading the next 45mins, it's gonna be so stressful #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only thing is the way we've thrown way leads this season you'd think we need another #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes!!! Get in Martial! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We should be 3 up #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's inevitable we rue these chances #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Confident pen from Rashford  #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Marcus!!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have to be finishing of those chances #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>James has to put that either side of Ederson #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!!üáæüá™#MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a win for Leinster! 3 from 3 &amp; 2 of their next 3 group games at at home #NORvLEI #ChampionsCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Ross Byrne! #NORvLEI #ChampionsCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Leinster so clincal today #NORvLEI #ChampionsCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great first half #NORvLEI #ChampionsCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another great break from Leinster, they‚Äôve been devastating on the counter #NORvLEI #ChampionsCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a try from Leinster! That‚Äôs all Gary Ringrose reading that loose pass #NORvLEI #ChampionsCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can‚Äôt believe there is some people out there that still believe he‚Äôs injured #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good throw by Dak on that TD tbf #DALvsCHI #TNFonFOX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How many tackles have the Cowboys missed tonight ? Their defense is so bad #DALvsCHI #TNFonFOX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What was Montgomery doing ? üòÇ #DALvsCHI #TNFonFOX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember coming into this season there was so much hype for this Cowboys defence #DALvsCHI #TNFonFOX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was some move by Patterson tbf #DALvsCHI #TNFonFOX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I get kicking at Solider Field at night in December is hard for any kicker but that Dallas kicker is really bad #DALvsCHI #TNFonFOX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh Trubisky #DALvsCHI #tnfonfox<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can‚Äôt believe a lot Arsenal fans thought Emery was their main problem #Arsenal #ARSBHA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nick is the prime example of why you shouldn‚Äôt hire sports fans as broadcasters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was one of our best performances this season maybe our best #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get in!! Rashford brilliant &amp; special mention for Fred as was pretty good #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is gonna be a long 13-14mins #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get in Marcus!!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shock #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You just know we're gonna regret missing these chances #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What an effort from Rashforfd, unlucky not to go in #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Marcus!! Come on!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only thing worse than 56 that voted for him is the 35 abstained #NoConfidence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Weird time to do this #Panthers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs a good result for the Packers sole control of the NFC North &amp; control of their destiny #MNF #MINvsSEA #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a by call Pete Carroll #MINvsSEA #MNF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All blown coverage's are bad but that's really bad from Rhodes #MINvsSEA #MNF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What was that ? #MINvsSEA #MNF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can‚Äôt wait to see what people will be saying about Brady today, shouting at receivers, pointing the finger at everyone but himself, a load garbage time yardage to make his numbers look good...I know a QB in Green Bay that gets hammered when he calls out receivers #TomBrady<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good start for Houston #NEvsHOU #SNFonNBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a read on that INT by Roby #SNFonNBC #NEvsHOU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolute clutch from McManus, what an ending #LACvsDEN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Casey Hayward what are you doing ?? #LACvsDEN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How did Mike Williams catch that ? Unbelievable #LACvsDEN #NFLSunday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus üò≥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know it got negated because of the holding penalty but that was some spin move by Eckler #LACvsDEN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just seen Jared Goff‚Äôs stat line of course he has his best game of the season when my fantasy opponent has him #NFLSunday #FantasyFootball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After a slow first half Luka really warming up in this 3rd quarter #DALvLAL #NBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every week I ask this how did the Packers lose to the Eagles #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Usually I wouldn‚Äôt choose NBA over NFL but I have to watch Luka vs LeBron &amp; the three late afternoon kick offs in the NFL on paper aren‚Äôt great #<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All round it wasn‚Äôt great but wasn‚Äôt bad either but I suppose the most important thing was the win #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>9-3 #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another INT!! Tramon Williams! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mercedes Lewis!! Touchdown!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Darnell Savage INT!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DAVANTE ADAMS!! Touchdown!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a throw by Rodgers!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big Z must be due a sack soon he‚Äôs getting a serious amount of Pressure on Daniel Jones #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another big play given üò° #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First couple of drives were good but then the same old story with Packers offense, need a good opening drive in the second half #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He‚Äôs 23 #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess the Packers don‚Äôt like defending 4th down #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Za‚ÄôDarius Smith just ran over the Giants on that last pressure #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In them conditions that‚Äôs great kick from Crosby #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>INT by King!! Let‚Äôs go!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What was that penalty ? #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What was that defense ? #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has LaFleur won a challenge this season ? #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think that‚Äôs a bad challenge #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Adams!! Touchdown!! Let‚Äôs go!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lazard with a nice catch!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big play from Kenny Clark üí™ #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah a Packers penalty on the very first drive, it wouldn‚Äôt be Packers game without one #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Enough of this shite, switching over to the Packers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Victor Lindelof!! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another poor first half, which is just the norm now #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a ball from Pereira! Finally done something good #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Rashford!! Come on!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shock #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What happened in the Norwich &amp; Arsenal game is why I have hard time watching neutral football games, VAR has ruined football just like I said it would during 2018 World Cup when most people loved it. Did that whole 2cm of encroachment really make much of a difference ? #NORARS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unbelievable just unbelievable #BAMAvsAUB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love this, it‚Äôs just unbelievable #BAMAvsAUB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I‚Äôm guessing no team wants to play defense #BAMAvAUB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a first half #BAMAvsAUB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see James Haskell is just as big a tw*t as ever #ImACeleb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know crazy things happen in college football but that's probably the game #OSUvsMICH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a catch by Garrett Wilson #OhioStateFootball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big turnover for Ohio State #OhioStateFootball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spin Doctor...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a drive by Michigan #michiganfootball #OhioStateFootball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Germany, France and Portgual jesus what a group #EURO2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Accept what‚Äôs gonna happen in May you will be better off for it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not so mad after all, very confident in this prediction now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some goal that from De Bruyne #NEWMCI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus wasn‚Äôt expecting that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Specia #Doncic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know everyone is going to be talking about Dallas but a lot of credit has to go to Buffalo. They‚Äôve been great offensively and defensively today #BUFvsDAL #NFLThanksgiving #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Josh Allen is becoming a very good of NFL QB, his throwing of the ball has improved a good bit, doesn‚Äôt turn the ball over &amp; is very athletic which everyone kinda knew already #BUFvDAL #NFLThanksgiving #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is with these kickers ? #BUFvsDAL #NFLThanksgiving #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where is that hands to the face ? #BUFvDAL #NFLThanksgiving #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a play by Josh Allen #BUFvsDAL #NFLThanksgiving #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was some pass from Allen to Beasley #BUFvsDAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was hardly a classic hopefully Cowboys &amp; Bills will be better but the way Bills play offense I doubt it #NFL #NFLThanksgiving<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe I spoke to soon ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è #NFLThanksgiving #NFL #CHIvsDET<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that wasn‚Äôt great but least thanksgiving in the America so I can NFL games tonight even if the first one is Mitchell Trubisky vs David Blough #NFLThanksgiving #NFL #CHIvsDET<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs so unlucky from Bernard has been pretty solid the whole game #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs very bad miss from Chong especially that they went up &amp; scored straight after #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Solid performance from the youngster in the first half #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good finish that from Jesse #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United! Excited to see some of these young lads playing in the first team #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrishRail I booked a ticket for the 12:07 train from Athlone to Tullamore bus missed the train can I still use for the one just after 14:00 as it‚Äôs fully flexible ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good strike that from Aurier #TOTOLY #UCL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The defending in this game has been atrocious #TOTOLY #UCL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More awful defending from Spurs again #TOTOLY #UCL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good strike from El Arabi but what was Danny Rose doing ? #TOTOLY #UCL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great strike from Hourihane #AVLNEW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the Packers still should/will make the playoffs because of the games still left but if the team don‚Äôt start learning from their mistakes fast we‚Äôll be one &amp; done in the playoffs #GOPACKGO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a Packers fan have to say last night was concerning. The team had 2 weeks to prepare for the game &amp; it mirrored the Chargers game so much, looks like nothing was learnt from that game by LaFleur or the team #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don‚Äôt think we are gonna sign him no matter the agent but how does Raiola seem to get every good young talent around everyone knows his reputation &amp; he stills manages to do it #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Game over, goodnight #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another 3 &amp; out what a shock #GOPACKGO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another 3 &amp; out coming up probably #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is f*cking frustrating!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know Bulaga is down but this OL is bad even with him &amp; I don't get why people saying its good #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have to score on this drive #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Defense is getting stops, that's why you kick FG on that 4th down #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big Z with the sack #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LaFleur playing calling 4th down is so predictable, should have just kicked a FG &amp; got points on the board #GOPACKGO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another good stop from the defense but I‚Äôm not expecting the offense to capitalize on it #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚ÄúPackers Bought all the refs‚Äù The refs love the Packers‚Äù #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This LA Chargers all over again #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good defensive stop #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has to catch that #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could we have gotten off to a worse start ? #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FFS Adams #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HailRodgers12_ #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This game is huge #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs incomplete #DALvNE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Cowboys have dogged some many bullet‚Äôs in this game #DALvsNE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was keeping an eye on the Mavs game whilst watching New England &amp; Dallas &amp; Luka Doncic is just unbelievable in 2-3 years him &amp; Giannis will own the NBA #LukaDoncic #Lukamagic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big drive for Dallas this one coming up #DALvsNE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big thanks to Jarvis Landry &amp; DJ Moore for saving my fantasy team this week #FantasyFootball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Panthers deserve that for not running the ball #CARvsNO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Carolina Panthers just missed 29 yard FG, they really should have ran the ball on that last drive #CARvsNO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surely the Panthers have to run the ball there ? #CARvsNO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've watched the Eagles 3 times since they beat the Packers &amp; every time after it I ask myself how did we lose to them ?#Packers #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The amount of turnovers in this game #SEAvPHI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had a good feeling about Jarvis Landry having a game against his former team so I stuck him in my fantasy team &amp; I‚Äôm feeling really good right now üòä #FantasyFootball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What was Russell doing there ? #SEAvsPHI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyway enough of United time for #NFLSunday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>have*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When we were 2-0 down I would snapped your hand off for a draw but after going 3-2 up that feels like a defeat #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now don't fuck this up United! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>MARCUS!!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Greenwood!!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lovely finish by Brandon Williams! Come on!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Get Poch now" yes cause Poch is gonna want any part of this shit when he could go to Bayern now or have his pick of clubs in the summer #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Useless bastards #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like what the fuck was that corner ? #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is Phil Jones still a professional footballer #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a shock #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>David De Gea. #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!!üáæüá™#MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unbelievable finish #CopaLibertadores2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh my god #CopaLibertadores2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Game on #CopaLibertadores2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How did Flamengo not score there ? #CopaLibertadores2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some achievement for Carlow to have club teams in both Leinster senior football and senior hurling finals #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some second half from Eire Og #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a start for Eire Og &amp; what finish as well #PORvEIR #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good goal from Mahrez but some of Chelsea's has been just as bad as City's #MCICHE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>City are so bad at the back #MCICHE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spanish press are the funniest &amp; worst of the lot, they trash Bale every week &amp; started the whole ‚ÄòBale likes playing golf more than playing for Madrid‚Äô &amp; now they are up in arms over him posting with that flag #GarethBale<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is BS #NCAA #JamesWiseman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>December 4th: Man Utd 0-2 Spurs  May 2020: Tottenham Champions League winners   I can just see it now   #Mourinho<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Another big win for the #IRLU21 tonight! üáÆüá™ #COYBIG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is wrong with Spurs ? #Pochettino #tottenham<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He‚Äôs just goals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AB an hour from now: F*ck the Patriots , F*ck Mr Kraft, F*ck the NFL #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gutted...#COYBIG #IREDEN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Schmeichel wasted a minute of the injury time &amp; yet the ref couldn‚Äôt find the time for one last free kick #IREDEN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè #COYBIG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is ref is having a laugh #IREDEN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs probably that #IREDEN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hourihane has to smash that #COYBIG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ireland were the better team for the first 20mins &amp; created nothing Denmark have been the best team for the last 5-6mins &amp; created 3 chances #COYBIG #IREDEN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on Ireland!!! #COYBIG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They don‚Äôt do they‚Äôre not claims #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a finish #BOSvSAC #NBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you just gonna admit your actually a Pats and your just pretending to be a Cowboys fan ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a touchdown #NEvPHI #NFLSunday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How do you lose a game that your 20 points up at the half ? Vic Fangio must have been taken classes at Dan Quinn school of choking #DENvMIN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lamar Jackson is ridiculous #HOUvsBAL #NFLSunday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes of course Dak &amp; Michael Gallup are having their best days of season the day my fantasy opponent has them #FantasyFootball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Whoneedthatwork I think your right he does have a bit of the Vick syndrome but a bad OL never helps<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs two beautiful TD throws from Jackson, he really can do it all #HOUvsBAL #NFLSunday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs some play from Scarlett #HOUvsBAL #NFLSunday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DeShaun Watson is probably my favorite non Green Bay player but he needs to learn when your playing with a bad OL you have to get rid of the ball #HOUvsBAL #NFLSunday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice throw from Lamar on that TD #HOUvsBAL #NFLSunday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel I say this every week but what‚Äôs the point of being able to challenge PI ? #HOUvsBAL #NFLSunday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs PI #HOUvsBAL #NFLSunday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Justin Tuck missing a FG great start to my fantasy week üëç #nflfantasylive #FantasyFootball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs unbelievable from Stockdale #BATHvULS #ChampionsCup<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Big result for Ireland! #SUIGEO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Switzerland!! #SUIGEO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That Myles Garrett &amp; Mason Rudolph thing is mad. Definite suspension coming for Garrett &amp; knowing the NFL DeCastro &amp; Pouncey will get one‚Äôs as well even though they shouldn‚Äôt #NFL #PITvsCLE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I‚Äôm Tampa &amp; Kap looks alright I‚Äôm taking a chance on him. Jamies just isn‚Äôt it #Kaepernick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs some grab by Rudolph tbf #SNFonNBC #MINvsDAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The one time I want the Cowboys to win watch them go lose #MINvsDAL #SNFonNBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today has been a good day Packers also in Fantasy news I had Derek Henry &amp; the Steelers defense #GoPackGo #FantasyFootball @NFLFantasy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bye comes at a great time for the Packers even though we won today the last couple of weeks haven‚Äôt been great #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Damn Jaire #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Kenny Clark done well there as well #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Preston Smith Sack!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aaron Jones is unbelievable #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good stop on the 2pt conversion #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚ÄòPackers get all the calls‚Äô #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine thinking the Packers are better without Davante #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another good run there by Jamaal Williams #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice run Jamaal Williams #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>INT!! Tramon Williams!!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Great route from Adams! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really hope that doesn‚Äôt comeback to bite us #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I‚Äôm all for being aggressive but I think you kick the field goal, go up by 7 &amp; you get the ball in the 2nd half #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs gonna count #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jimmy Graham with a huge gain!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Massively bailed out there #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Preston Smith sack üí™!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unreal. #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Touchdown Aaron Jones again!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a throw by Rodgers &amp; what a catch Davante Adams #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let‚Äôs go!!! Fumble recovery #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>JK Scott‚Äôs punting has been the only consistent thing on this team &amp; even that doesn‚Äôt look to good right now #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs a bs call #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big 3rd down stop! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs the 3rd sack Allen has avoided already Packers need to finish them #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aaron Jones touchdown!!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good catch from Lazard #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FFS #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>False on the second play of the first offensive drive already giving up a big play on defense #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice stop from King #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can‚Äôt wait for McCaffery to go for 150 #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saquon 13 carrier 1 yard üòÆüò¨ #NYGiants<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It would have been the more Cleveland thing ever if Kitchens iced the kicker he missed it &amp; on the retake he scored it #BUFvCLE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh #KCvsTEN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That forward pass call was correct but Cleveland are just a mess #BUFvCLE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why did Kitchens just call a timeout there ? #CLEvsBUF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He‚Äôs a video game this is just unbelievable #BALvCIN #Ravens<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs some goal line stand from the Bills #BUFvsCLE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Baker made some much needed good throws on that first drive for his confidence #BUFvsCLE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep I do have Jarvis Landry on my fantasy bench #BUFvsCLE #FantasyFootball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jamies Winston is very good NFL backup but he's not a starter #ARIvsTB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's already game over, City all over the place at the back #LIVMCI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a pen #LIVMCI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Much needed league win! Come on United!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joelklatt Everyone knows that unless they have disaster game in their last 3 games the 4th spot is going to Alabama<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How has he missed that ?? #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Rashford!! Get in!!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck sake #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good first half from United #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That was just great to watch #LSUvsBAMA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>31/39, 393 passing yards, 3TD's &amp; 64 rushing yards, Joe Borrow just booked his ticket to the NFL &amp; maybe the Heisman trophy as well #LSUvsBAMA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man this game #LSUvsBAMA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LSU needed that score #LSUvsBAMA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Edwards-Helaire what a play #LSUvsBAMA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is the national championship game all over again #LSUvsBAMA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Nice throw by Tua for that TD #LSUvsBAMA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Punt returns for TD's are always impressive but they don't get much more impressive than that one for Alabama #LSUvsBAMA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awful start from Alabama #LSUvsBAMA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good adjustment by Chase on that TD catch #LSUvsBAMA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big turnover early in this game #LSUvsBAMA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that's probably Penn State's chance of a playoff spot gone unless they can beat Ohio state in a couple of weeks even then that might no be enough. What a win for Minnesota though #PennState #Minnesota<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>James Maddison absolute quality #LEIARS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>See a lot of people saying Solskjaer out &amp; that‚Äôs fair enough worst start to season in over 30 years but where has sacking manager after manager gotten us before ? We could hire Klopp or Guardiola tomorrow &amp; in two years we‚Äôll be in the same situation #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just read that‚Äôs Bournemouth first goal in 6hrs of course it comes against us #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dan James has Bournemouth all over place atm #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sure about that ? #ENGvsRSA #RWCFinal #RWC2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Siys Kolsi what a player, what a man #RWCFinal #RWC2019 #ENGvRSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should have been more confident in my original pick üëÄ #RWCFinal #RWC2019 #ENGvRSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cheslin Kolbe üëè #RWCFinal #RWC2019 #ENGvRSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have to say that pass from Marx looked forward #RWCFinal #RWC2019 #ENGvRSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs brilliant from South Africa especially that last pass from Am #RWCFinal #RWC2019 #ENGvRSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was always a difficult kick even for Pollard got to kick that to the corner #RWCFinal #RWC2019 #ENGvRSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Winning that scrum is big for England #RWCFinal #RWC2019 #ENGvRSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Out from the first kick Pollard‚Äôs kicking has been ridiculously good so far #ENGvRSA #RWCFinal¬† #RWC2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_scottsaunders It‚Äôs unbelievable to watch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>England just can‚Äôt live with the South Africa scrum, it‚Äôs a thing of beauty #RWC2019 #RWCFinal #ENGvRSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>South Africa‚Äôs scrum has destroyed England in the first half #RWCFinal #RWC2019 #ENGvRSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs brilliant from Am but Elliot Daly has to take that #RWCFinal #RWC2019 #ENGvRSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be level after the they played in the first 20mins + De Jager &amp; Mbonbani gone off is big for England #RWCFinal #RWC2019 #ENGvRSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>England haven‚Äôt settled at all in this #RWC2019¬† #RWCFinal¬† #ENGvRSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was some take from Pollard #RWC2019 #RWCFinal #ENGvRSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bad miss for player of Pollard‚Äôs kicking ability #RWC2019¬† #ENGvRSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkySportsRugby Hint‚Äôs in the title World Player of the Year, England have had a great World Cup &amp; deserve to be in the final but they haven‚Äôt had a great year because of the 6 nations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Juan Soto might have just saved the Nationals right there #WorldSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another big win, need to keep this going now #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cristiano Ronaldo vs Portsmouth is the first thing that comes to mind #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a goal Rashford!! Come on!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The way we come out &amp; play in second half's is becoming a problem #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Solid first half from United, McTominay very good again #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Marcus!! Come on!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!!üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>7-1 #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was some ball from Bannon #SWFCvLEEDS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I‚Äôve fancied South Africa from the start &amp; obviously they have to get past Wales tomorrow but after watching England today I‚Äôm a bit less confident in that pick #RWC2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unreal performance from England I haven‚Äôt seen New Zealand in a long time maybe ever #RWC2019 #ENGvsNZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The way New Zealand are playing that could be the insurance for England #ENGVSNZL #RWC2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>England‚Äôs defense has been something else today. They haven‚Äôt been caught narrow once, absolutely no space for New Zealand to play #ENGVSNZL #RWC2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs some hit by Underhill on Scott Barrett #RWC2019 #ENGVSNZL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow üòÆ #RWC2019 #ENGVSNZL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What was Seevu Reece doing there ? He‚Äôs never gonna make that #ENGVSNZL #RWC2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How did Seevu Reece claim &amp; stay in ? Unreal #ENGvNZL #RWC2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs a massive let off #ENGvNZL #RWC2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>England fully deserved lead at Halftime, probably should be up by more. Fascinating second half in store #ENGvNZL #RWC2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>England have New Zealand rattled here #NZLvENG #RWC2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs brilliant defending from Goodhue #RWC2019 #NZLvENG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a start from England! #RWC2019 #NZLvENG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus #SOULEI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Obviously good to get the win but that was poor #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Martial!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That feeling I talked about in my previous tweet that just got a little more real #Packers #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was thinking about the game earlier today &amp; for some reason I said to myself I wouldn‚Äôt bed surprised if Mahomes played &amp; I know him being back facility is probably just rehab but still...#Packers #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üòÇüò≠ #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some day a coach will challenge PI and win it #NFL #SEAvBAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What throw by Lamar Jackson not a bad catch either by Mark Andrews #SEAvBAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just in case people didn't get the message Aaron Rodgers is still Aaron Rodgers #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>6-1 #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>MVS touchdown!!! Let's go!!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kevin King INT!!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jaire Alexander with a big stop! Let's go!!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Touchdown!! Jimmy Graham!! #GoPackGO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What throw by Rodgers and what a catch by Allen Lazard #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a move from Jimmy Graham #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can the Packers secondary cover that TE at least once #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rodgers runs it in!! Touchdown! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rodgers to MVS for 59 yards! Lets go!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jake Kumerow!! Touchdown!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lazard has to catch that #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big let off #GoPackGO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is with this secondary today ?? #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jamaal Williams!! Touchdown!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is that PI ?? #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vitale is our best receiver right now #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Secondary has played badly so far #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should have won that #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Japan‚Äôs offloading is actually ridiculous #JPNvsRSA #RWC2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That move from Japan deserved a try brilliant attacking play from them #RWC2019 #JPNvsRSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>South Africa already look to powerful for Japan #RWC2019 #JPNvsRSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That looked forward to me but France have only themselves to blame 9pts up &amp; still tryna run in try‚Äôs instead of taking points when they are on offer also if they would have taken points instead kicking to the corner the maul doesn‚Äôt happen &amp; neither does the red card #RWC2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wouldn‚Äôt Be surprised if they still turn it around but have to say Wales have been so sloppy today #WALvFRA #RWC2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs brilliant defending from Huget #WALvFRA #RWC2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don‚Äôt get me wrong it‚Äôs great to watch when it comes off but are France trying to be to expensive sometimes you just have to go through the phases #WALvFRA #RWC2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a try that is from France #WALvFRA #REC2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good start from France #WALvFRA #RWC2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lot has been said since the game this morning but as a fan all I‚Äôm going say is thanks to Joe Schmidt what he has done 6 years as Ireland Coach has been remarkable #TeamOfUs #ShoulderToShoulder #IrishRugby @IrishRugby<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What throw by Trevor Lawrence &amp; what catch by Justyn Ross #Clemson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is an embarrassment #NZLvIRL #RWC2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are impossible to stop in this form #NZLvIRL #RWC2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üçÄüôè #NZLvIRE #RWC2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs brilliant from Koroibete #ENGvAUS #RWC2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brilliant defending from Australia there but England definitely growing into this game after a poor start #ENGvAUS #RWC2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love these two guys, the energy they bring to the Packers is something the team hasn‚Äôt had in along time #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Irish player‚Äôs may as well not challenge for the ball in the air cause every time they do it‚Äôs a free to Switzerland #SUIIRE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on Ireland!! üáÆüá™ #COYBIG #SUIIRE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did we get some calls tonigh ? Yes  Do I care ? No  Why ? Because Packers have been stiffed by the refs before &amp; they will be in future because the refs never get held accountable for their poor decisions   #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two takeaways from that game:  1. If any TE on that team should be earning $10mil a year it‚Äôs Mercedes Lewis not Jimmy Graham  2. We need a WR really bad   #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5-1 let‚Äôs go!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What throw from Rodgers &amp; what a catch by Lazard! Touchdown!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No matter how this game ends up the Packers need to get on the phone &amp; trade for a WR #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Huge run from Jamaal Williams #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Defense needed that stop, ZaDarius Smith coming up with another sack #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now defense time to get a stop #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jamaal Williams!! Touchdown!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jones you have to catch that #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It‚Äôs gonna be long tonight &amp; a painful one to if we don‚Äôt start making stops #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the worlds of @stephenasmith ‚ÄòWhat can go wrong will go wrong with the Dallas Cowboys‚Äô goodnight #DALvsNYJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Falcons still really haven't got over blowing SB in 2017 have they ? #ATLvsAZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This 49ers defense is for real #SFvsLAR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chiefs are becoming 2012-2018 Packers when their unbelievably talented QB doesn't play well they lose cause their defense can't stop anything #KCvHOU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tyreek Hill that's just unbelievable, the leap is ridiculous #HOUvsKC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scotland are doing exactly what Ireland done kicking the ball to Japan which they want so they can just keep running at you &amp; popping it off #JPNvSCO #RWC2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs absolutely brilliant from Japan #JPNvSCO #RWC2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some start #JPNvSCO #RWC2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trevor Lawrence needs to learn that sometimes you should just throw it away &amp; not force it #Clemson #CollegeFootball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is that a red card for Conor McHugh ? #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Conor McHugh would make every other county panel in the country &amp; would probably start for most of them. Class player &amp; his kicking accuracy tonight has been absolutely brilliant #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CeeDee Lamb!! Wow!! #BeatTexas #OUvsTexas #RedRiverRivalry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know it didn't get the 1st down but that play from Jalen Hurts on 3rd down was amazing #OUvsTexas #RedRiverRivalry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unbelievable from CeeDee Lamb #OUvsTexas #BeatTexas #RedRiverShowdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Far from a classic so far #OUvsTexas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some old Ireland solid at the back but can‚Äôt create &amp; score chances #GEOvIRE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on Ireland!! üáÆüá™ #COYBIG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good try from Ireland now it‚Äôs time to take Sexton off #IREvSAM #RWC2019 #TeamOfUs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good to get the bonus point before half time but New Zealand are licking there lips at this Ireland not playing great again #RWC2019 #IREvSAM #TeamOfUs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great try from Ireland #IREvSAM #RWC2019 #TeamOfUs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tadhg Furlong what a player #IREvSAM #RWC2019 #TeamOfUs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good start from Ireland #IREvSAM #RWC2019 #TeamOfUs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing will change until Ed &amp; the Glazers are. Now I‚Äôm gonna go back to not allowing United piss me off (2/2) #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The whole cancelling #RWC2019 games is a joke other the money of course I for one will never understand why organizations bring tournaments to places where there‚Äôs a big chance of game cancellations due to weather conditions&amp;let‚Äôs be honest Japan ain‚Äôt stranger to adverse weather<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you would have offered me that the Packers would have been 4-1 when schedule came out &amp; we had Chicago, Minnesota, Philadelphia &amp; Dallas in 4 of the first 5 game &amp; a new HC I would have snapped your hand off, I thought at best 3-2 #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That game shouldn't have been so nerve wrecking but the Packers got the win #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4-1 #GoPackGO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He Missed It!!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Packers have missed like 3 sacks on this drive #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jerry definitely paid the refs at HT #GoPackGO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>F*ck #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kevin King!! INT!! Let's go!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the Packers don't score on this drive I can see them blowing it #GoPackGO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't you throw this away Packers #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aaron Jones unbelievable #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big Z with another sack #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aaron Jones!! Let's go!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two good plays by Williams and Alexander there #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another great punt from JK #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great pressure from Adrian Amos #GoPackGO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tonyan, Bulaga, Savage &amp; now ZaDarius Smith hurt man we can't catch a break with these injuries right now #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Need to sort the redzone offense #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aaron Jones is balling right now #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Preston Smith Sack!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These injuires are already starting to pile up #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>For I think the first time in my life I wish Young would have shot there #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Aaron Connolly for the Ireland senior squad in the next qualifiers is surely a must #BHATOT #Ireland<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Unlucky from Pereira #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Arsenal have faced the most shots in the league so we all know what's happening tonight United will have about 10 shots with 1 on target #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a play! #KCvDET<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably best game of the World Cup so far #RWC2019 #AUSvWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs a big try for Wales unless an Australia miracle in the 2nd half that‚Äôs probably the game over #RWC2019 #AUSvWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is game has been a good watch so far #RWC2019 #AUSvWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good try that from Australia #RWC2019 #AUSvWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs brilliant from Biggar &amp; Hadleigh Parks #RWC2019 #AUSvWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don‚Äôt get me wrong Japan were great &amp; I don‚Äôt wanna take anything away from them their exciting to watch but Ireland played into their hands so much, they want you to keep giving them the ball so they can run at you &amp; burn you out &amp; that‚Äôs exactly what happened #JAPvIRE #RWC2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrishRugby Two things guaranteed at the World Cup Ireland getting a load of bad injuries &amp; losing games they should be winning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don‚Äôt know what to say after they #RWC2019 #JPNvIRE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gardner is having a fucking laugh now #RWC2019 #JPNvIRE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ireland are goosed here #RWC2019 #JPNvIRE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep still politics #RWC2019 #JPNvIRE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ireland are playing right into Japan‚Äôs hands #RWC2019 #JPNvIRE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How are you suppose to role away when their holding you down ? #RWC2019 #JPNvIRE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Angus Gardner has to be the worst referee in rugby #RWC2019 #JPNvIRE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Josh Van Der Filer üëèüëè #COYBIG #RWC2019 #JPNvIRE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Come on Ireland!! #COYBIG #RWC2019 #JPNvIRE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Passing when running, running when passing the play calling tonight has absolutely puzzled me #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Packers can you stop the run just once ? #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is with this offense running the ball the whole night when they should be passing &amp; one time they should run the ball they pass #GoPackGGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This defense is giving me bad memories of Dom Capers defenses right now #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Touchdown!! Jimmy Graham!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stop running it so much!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good coverage by King on 2pt play but this defense is getting humbled right now #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is that not PI ? #GoPackGO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Touchdown!! Geroimo!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a catch by Allison #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Devante Adams!! Another big play #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good 1st quarter #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good tackle from Amos #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aaron Jones!! Let's go!! #GoPackGO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What throw by Rodgers and what a catch by Adam #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is ridiculous, that has to be an ejection #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Defense getting pressure early but the Packers really need sort out the rush defense #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No Keogh or Duffy for the qualifiers &amp; just when you thought Ireland‚Äôs qualifying campaign was going so well #Ireland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Mason!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brilliant clearance from Wan-Bissaka, putting it out there now come May it wouldn't surprise me if he's our POTY #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pogba has to score that #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mad how most of the people that don‚Äôt like &amp; always attacking this girl are over 40 years of age &amp; Trump supporters #GretaThurnberg #GretaThunbergOutdidTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3-0 #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Have by United's standards post Fergie this has been bad #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Great first clearance kick from Jack Carty #RWC2019 #IREvSCO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Andrew Conway!! Bonus point try! ‚òòÔ∏è #RWC2019 #IREvSCO<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Cheslin Kolbe is magic #RWC2019 #NZLvsRSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Astounds me how Garcas is still allowed to referee rugby games never mind refereeing the biggest group game at a World Cup #RWC2019 #NZLvsRSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brilliant drop goal from Pollard #RWC2019 #NZLvsRSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is class #RWC2019 #NZLvRSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pity Cheslin Kolbe didn‚Äôt score there, it would have been one of the best tries I‚Äôve ever seen.  Brilliant counter attack play from him #RWC2019 #NZLvRSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some unbelievable stuff from New Zealand in that first half (2/2) #RWC2019 #NZLvRSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whilst I‚Äôd never write off the All Blacks I thought coming into this game that South Africa would have the mental edge in this considering they beat New Zealand in New Zealand last year &amp; won the rugby championship this year but who wrong was I so far ?...(1/2) #RWC2019¬†#NZLvRSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs unbelievable from the All Blacks #RWC2019 #NZLvRSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The All Blacks &amp; The Springboks on second day of the World Cup couldn‚Äôt ask for much more on a opening weekend could you ? #RWC2019 #NZLvRSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big win for France #FRAvARG #RWC2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Went to shop at half time thinking the way the scoreline &amp; the way France were playing that it was over come back &amp; Argentina back within 2 points with 5mins to go #FRAvARG #RWC2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>France look unbelievable right now #RWC2019 #FRAvARG<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Lets go!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My thoughts exactly, people talk about a lot about older players in Dublin‚Äôs squad the likes Cluxton, Bogan &amp; MDA but if you look at their overall team it‚Äôs young enough to win two more or at the very least one #RTEGAA #DUBvKER<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sean O‚ÄôShea what a score #RTEGAA #DUBvKER #AllIrelandFinal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great first half #RTEGAA #DUBvKER #AllIrelandFinal<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Here we go #DUBvKER #RTEGAA #AllIrelandFinal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a great performance but a much needed win! Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fred has to play that to Chong #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>United starting to live dangerously, if we‚Äôre not careful Leicester will score #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great defending there from Harry Maguire #mufcu23<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright first but nothing really to get excited about other than goal which was penalty #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Rashford!! Come on!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealSkipBayless It's the Giant's R-E-L-A-X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a play by Eli #Giants #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have to say Dak has thrown some good passes in the first half #Cowboys #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The 2018 QB draft class don't look to good atm expect Lamar Jackson for course #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm starting to believe Odell might be a curse on QB's, Manning began to fall off the cliff when he arrived in New York &amp; now Baker who would have been ROTY but for Saquon having a unbelievable rookie year looks awful #Browns #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cleveland are killing themselves with all these penalties #Browns #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Landry &amp; Njoku for Cleveland &amp; Henry for Tennessee just got me major fantasy points on the last 3 plays #NFL #FantasyFootball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great throw from Mayfield and a great catch from Landry on that play for Cleveland #Browns #NFL<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Gardner Minshew 9/9 for 128 yards at HT, didn't see that coming #Jaguars #NFL100<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't get the Dolphins to be honest they gave up a 2nd round pick for Josh Rosen but it looks like their out there tanking for Tua #Dolphins #NFL100<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a throw by Baker Mayfield on that play before the TD #Browns  #NFL100<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How does Ingram drop that ??? #LSUvsTexas #CollegeFootball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a catch Brennan Eagles #LSUvsTexas #CollegeFootball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think Trevor Lawrence can be a generational QB talent but have to say I‚Äôve been underwhelmed by him in the 1st couple of games! Played better today &amp; made a couple of brilliant throws but still I expected a bit more #clemsontigers #CollegeFootball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That throw from Trevor Lawerence to Justyn Ross that chalked off for the flag was brilliant from both the QB and WR #clemsontigers #CollegeFootball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*Pretends to be shocked   #antoniobrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unbelievable from Trevor Lawerence #CollegeFootball #clemsontigers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We all know Antonio Brown is ending up in New England #NFL #Patriots #antoniobrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two good wins in row for Ireland considering where they were after the England game #IRLvWAL #TeamOfUs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs brilliant defensive play by Henshaw &amp; Kearney #IRLvWAL #TeamOfUs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don‚Äôt get me wrong that was awful but a win in Chicago on the first night of the season I‚Äôll take it #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Andrew Luck wow üòÆ #NFL #AndrewLuck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>gonna get any better. It‚Äôs time to give Gomes ago from the start.

<|startoftext|>season! We need give Ol√© time if after 2 full seasons in charge this hasn‚Äôt changed then fair enough in saying that has he to show some ruthlessness now with players like Jesse.

<|startoftext|>I‚Äôll never be Pogba‚Äôs biggest fan as a footballer but the abuse he got against Cardiff &amp; last night isn‚Äôt deserved nobody deserves racist abuse #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also Dan James wasn‚Äôt as bad as lots of people are making out first 20mins he was poor but after that he was good. Second half he was the United player causing the most problems #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is positives to take from tonight especially in the first half. Wan Bissaka was brilliant again &amp; the way we controlled the game in the first half &amp; I'm sure most people will see the positives tomorrow now just feels like a defeat right now #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wolves away at night on a weekday is a fixture I don't wanna see us play again just feels like a cursed fixture or something #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's starting to look like one of those nights #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Didn't realize how good that finish was at the time from Martial until I seen it there again #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AskAIB Hi, do ye convert Sterling back into Euro ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If United sell Rojo for ¬£25mil &amp; Lukaku deal is completed for ¬£73mil + the 10mil we got for Fellaini our net spend will be ¬£40mil also if you take out net spend &amp; just talk about the ¬£148mil we have spent how do you spend ¬£148mil the most in the PL &amp; be worse ? #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SportsJOEdotie McTominay won‚Äôt be on the bench he‚Äôll be starting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I could be proved wrong &amp; I hope I am but can‚Äôt see us finish top 6 this season, we‚Äôve improved our defense but as a squad overall we are worse, we lost two midfielders, a striker &amp; not replacement any of them #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>but feel this gonna be really bad season. We have taken two steps forward in signing Maguire &amp; Wan Bissaka but three steps back in not bringing an attacking Midfielder, a replacement for Herrera &amp; a replacement for Lukaku #MUFC (2/2)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We haven‚Äôt even laid the foundations properly yet never mind starting the building work #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Selling Lukaku &amp; no replacement for him...I LOVE THIS GAME #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Dybala stays at Juve instead of Spurs then he has no self respect they've now accepted two bids for him the swap with Lukaku &amp; now ‚Ç¨70mil from Spurs they clearly want him gone. I get why he wanted a load of money from us both Spurs have CL &amp; their manager is Argentine #Dybala<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@talkSPORT @Sjopinion10 They finished 12th last year 3 points off tenth &amp; looks like they‚Äôre gonna keep Zaha as well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We‚Äôre not signing Eriksen &amp; one reason for that is Levy will want probably similar to what Madrid paid for Hazard &amp; the second reason why would Eriksen who played in the CL final last season come &amp;play for a club that doesn‚Äôt have CL football (unless we pay ridiculous wage) #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don‚Äôt fucking do this to me #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some goal üî• #HUDDER #eflchampionship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If they believe they 'have sufficient cover' why are they still trying to sign Mandzuckic ? They know we don't have enough goals but don't wanna pay we've got our one big signing this season #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good to see United agree with me #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Welcome to Manchester United @HarryMaguire93 üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Utd Fans 3 months ago: I‚Äôm sick of mercenary footballers using us for a big wage &amp;don‚Äôt wanna play for the club we should only sign players that wanna play for us  Utd fans after we walk away from the Dybala deal cause of high wage demands: Just pay him we pay Sanchez 350k  #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RFFH Your wasting your time explaining simple logic to American conservatives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>United fans do this to themselves Dybala was never ever coming &amp; the whole summer everywhere in England were reporting no interest in Fernandes yet ye chose to to listen to Portuguese media that still have us signing Gaitan #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Simon Stone reporting Fernandes isn't on United's list all we need now is to sign Longstaff and the meltdown on here will be something to behold #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd shocked if we sign anyone after Maguire tbh which is problem because throughout the summer we've focused on sorting the defence &amp; rightfully so cause it needed it but we've completely ignored how the bad midfield is with Herrera leaving and how much Matic has declined #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not that disappointed about Dybala tbh I've always said throughout the whole thing we have to avoid Di Maria 2.0 &amp; it looks like we have but I'm not gonna lie I will be disappointed if we don't sign a midfielder by Thursday &amp; that doesn't look likely right now #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dybala isn't coming we're wasting our time with it, surely we have other midfield targets we can sign before Thursday #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some awful defending by Leeds to concede that Weimann goal #eflchampionship #BristolCityvLeeds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some clearance from Walker #FACommunityShield #LIVMCI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's ridiculous how good City are on the ball rarely if ever panic #FACommunityShield #LIVMCI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By the sounds of it Young isn‚Äôt gonna player every week so why give a player that isn‚Äôt gonna player every week the captaincy? #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Greenwood &amp; Gomes took two excellent penalties they also brought more energy &amp; pace to the game in 7-8 mins than Matic &amp; Mata did the whole they were on #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>De Gea actually saved a penalty #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good finish by Jesse #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Take Lindelof off can't be having Maguire making his debut alongside Smalling, Jones or Rojo it will scar him for the whole of his United career #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some score by Paddy Durcan #MayVDon #SKYGAA #GAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unreal score from Jason Doherty #MayVDon #SKYGAA #GAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Matic is actually a problem for us he's finished #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice bit of play there from Rashford to score #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting timing of his decision to try start forcing a move after doing the whole of preseason (except today), no concrete offer from Madrid &amp; knowing the English window closes Thursday&amp;there‚Äôs no chance of United selling him &amp; buying a replacement in that period of time #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>United fans always complain about how Sanchez‚Äôs wage has caused problems within the squad so not putting it in Dybala‚Äôs contract cause more problems in the squad ? #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great to have football back üëç #lutonboro<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is Maguire overpriced ? Yes but does he improve our defense ? Yes #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NORDWOOD!!!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrTomMcDermott Maybe Harry Maguire but I'm not holding my breath<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wish every club would do this when media say fee‚Äôs have been agreed &amp; they actually haven‚Äôt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ahmadioha Yeah I know but latest reports say Tottenham has sent people to try &amp; do a deal for him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Window closes this time next week &amp; when we don‚Äôt sign anyone else the meltdown on here is gonna be hilarious until the realization of how bad we still are when Dybala is still at Juve, Fernandes has signed for Tottenham &amp; Maguire is still with Leicester #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In saying all that I still feel like this is Di Maria 2.0 &amp; this time next year he‚Äôll want out #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1. There must something wrong somewhere with him if they are willing to just do a straight swap &amp; drop the cash amount they wanted   2. If there isn‚Äôt anything wrong with him &amp; they just really want rid of him &amp; he still wants to stay then he needs his head tested #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also forgot we have no CL football would he wanna come to a team with no CL doubt it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One last thing I could be wrong but I just can‚Äôt see it happening, he doesn‚Äôt wanna leave Juve &amp; he could just wait 12 months &amp; see if Madrid, Barca or PSG all clubs he would prefer to go to come in for him #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also South Americans never work at United Veron, Anderson, Di Maria, Falcao just to name a few #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dybala doesn‚Äôt wanna come to United this is just another Di Maria situation where the club doesn‚Äôt want him but he‚Äôs forced out the door &amp; clubs where he would like (Probably Madrid or Barca) have FFP to worry about, United should stay away from this one #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Usually I‚Äôd believe Di Marzio but Simon Stone is usually spot on with United &amp; he says United haven‚Äôt an agreement for Maguire &amp; no real interest in Fernandes. This window is starting to really get annoying now #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheHerd @ColinCowherd ‚ÄòWe never consider what your surrounded by‚Äô yet you‚Äôve been hating Rodgers for the best part of decade for not getting to another SB yet never considered the poor defense that he was playing with &amp; in the last couple of years poor parts of the offense as well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rio was amazing but this guy from 2008 to 2012 was something else, best CB in the world during that period #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I could be wrong but I really can‚Äôt see us signing Fernandes everywhere in England are reporting he isn‚Äôt high on our transfer list&amp;surely they all can‚Äôt be lying. Can see him ending up at Liverpool tbh they are interested in him &amp;it‚Äôs the only position they need to improve #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unbelievable from Tipp but you have to feel Wexford threw that away 5 points up with an extra man #RTEGAA #WEXvTIPP #GAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs a beauty from Jake Morris #RTEGAA #WEXvTIPP #GAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ronan Maher is having some game for Tipp #RTEGAA #WEXvTIPP #GAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is game is something else #RTEGAA #WEXvTIPP #GAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wexford have had a bit of a collapse since Lee Chin‚Äôs goal #RTEGAA #WEXvTIPP #GAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Them last 3 scores for Tipp show there‚Äôs still a lot of Hurling to play in this #RTEGAA #WEXvTIPP #GAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lot of questionable decisions in this game but that wasn‚Äôt one of them definite red card #RTEGAA #WEXvTIPP #GAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs a beauty from Paul Morris #RTEGAA #WEXvTIPP #GAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some start to second half by Tipp #RTEGAA #WEXvTIPP #GAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was some first half of Hurling, Liam Ryan &amp; Matthew O‚ÄôHanlon been unreal for Wexford in defence #RTEGAA #WEXvTIPP #GAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That could be massive instead of Tipp being level Wexford get another point #RTEGAA #WEXvTIPP #GAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a pass that was by Shaun Murphy to setup Conor McDonald for Wexford‚Äôs goal, cracker of a game so far #RTEGAA #WEXvTIPP #GAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some goal by Calllanan #RTEGAA #WEXvTIPP #GAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs brilliant from Liam Ryan, what a start to this game #RTEGAA #WEXvTIPP #GAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some scores by Paudie Foley &amp; Ronan Maher to start the game #RTEGAA #WEXvTIPP #GAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never write off Kilkenny #RTEGAA #GAA #LIMvKK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hurling best sport in the world bar none #RTEGAA #LIMvKK #GAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some defending there from Mike Casey #RTEGAA #LIMvKK #GAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be only 3 points behind at half time with the way they‚Äôve been shooting is a good result for Limerick #RTEGAA #LIMvKK #GAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Limerick‚Äôs shooting has been dreadful so far #RTEGAA #LimvKK #GAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some starts by Kilkenny #RTEGAA #LimvKK #GAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don‚Äôt see why fans are happy with us selling Lukaku yes he ain‚Äôt great but he‚Äôs certainly not worse player we have &amp; we aren‚Äôt gonna replace with the money we get for him #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Dybala is willing to come to United then I'd take him cause you ain't gonna find that quality for the fee Inter are willing to pay for Lukaku #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beautiful goal that from Gomes #MUFC #MUTOUR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dan James‚Äôs work rate is brilliant  #MUFC #MUTOUR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spurs do realize it‚Äôs a friendly ? #MUTOUR #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good ball through from Pereira for that goal #MUTOUR #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These people do realize they‚Äôve only known each other 7 weeks &amp; they don‚Äôt owe each other anything #LoveIsland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Atletico need to get over this, yes a deal might have been done before 1st of July but Barca or Griezmann are never gonna admit this &amp; it‚Äôs partly their own fault for not having just the same release clause for before &amp; after the 1st of July #Griezmann #Barca #Atleti<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Nearly 4 hours since that Maguire story came out &amp; no reliable news source has came out &amp; backed it up, their not even denying which shows their not even entertaining it.

<|startoftext|>Good score there from Andy Moran but overall expected a lot more from Mayo today #RTEGAA #kerryvmayo #GAA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Good score that from Mark Collins #CorkVKerry #RTEGAA #GAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>David Clifford is different class, unbelievable piece of skill to keep that in play #RTEGAA #GAA #CorkVKerry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good finish from Tom O‚ÄôSullivan but awful defending from Cork #RTEGAA #CorkVKerry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3-20 from play is unbelievable stuff from @Offaly_GAA U-20 üëèüíö‚ö™Ô∏èüíõ @OffalyTracker<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>United offer ¬£40m for AWB, Palace say no we want ¬£50m United reply ¬£35m + ¬£15m in add-ons. Why can‚Äôt we just be like every other big club &amp; just pay what clubs want ? Why do we have to always haggle for players when we have the money &amp;the selling club know we have the money #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FTFonFS1 @getnickwright I‚Äôm old enough to remember when Nick basically guaranteed a Bucks title win because they were a nightmare matchup for every team in the NBA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Beating Mayo &amp; Galway on the way to win the Connacht championship is some feat by Roscommon #RTEGAA #GAA #GALvROS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a score! Conor Cox apparently not good enough for the Kerry panel #RTEGAA #GAA #GALvROS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1 point in a half an hour of football is awful stuff from Galway especially with some of the fire power they have #RTEGAA #GAA #GALvROS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Diarmuid Murtagh has some first 15mins in this second half #GAA #RTEGAA #GALvROS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent start to the second half from Roscommon #RTEGAA #GAA #GALvROS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs a brilliant score from Conor Cox even if he didn‚Äôt mean it #RTEGAA #GALvROS #GAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beautiful from Jason Forde, there‚Äôs no better sight in Hurling than seeing a sideline cut go over the bar #RTEGAA #GAA #TIPPvLIM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brilliant from John McGarth to setup Callanan #RTEGAA #GAA #TIPPvLIM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some goal that from Tony Kelly for Clare #CLAvCOR #RTEGAA #GAA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Final word on Pogba cause I couldn‚Äôt be arsed talking about this the whole day...United existed well before Pogba &amp; we‚Äôll exists well after him, we‚Äôve let a lot better players go Ronaldo, Keane, etc...&amp; we survived #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>suppose to be the best player in the team. Wait till he goes to Madrid (if he goes there) cause if the treatment Bale gets a player whose scored 2 CL final winners for them is anything to go buy he‚Äôs in for a whale of a time #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And this is not a dig at the Munster championship last summers Munster championship was brilliant to watch, its Leinster doesn't get the credit it deserves #GAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the last two weeks of the Leinster championship was the Munster championship you wouldn't hear the end of it, unbelievable stuff #GAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beautiful point from Wexford #SKYGAA #WEXKIL #GAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some control from Adrian Mullen to bring it down and score that goal #WEXKIL #SKYGAA #GAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That would have been some goal #WEXKIL #SKYGAA #GAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That some was catch by McDonald but equally good tackle from Walsh #WEXKIL #SKYGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very good first 20mins, some good hurling being played #WEXKIL #SKYGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The darkest day in Offaly Hurling history big changes needed on &amp; off the field #OffalyGAA #GAABelong #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kyle Lowry has come to play #NBAFinals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Militao, Jovic, Hazard &amp; now Mendy this is how a big club acts in when they are rebuilding<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Toronto had that game in the palm of their hands with just 3mins, to many times they took 3pt shots when they should have just drove to the basket #NBAFinals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klay really is so under-rated #NBAfinals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kawhi Leonard man is unbelievable #NBAFinals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crazy first half the way GSW were hitting 3‚Äôs early on it looked like they were walk this one but that K.D injury might have just changed the game #NBAFinals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uh oh #NBAfinals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2/2 from 3 inside 2mins for Durant Raptors should be a bit worried already #NBAfinals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally!! Get in Robbie Brady! üáÆüá™#COYBIG #IRLGIB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor enough first half from Ireland! These are the sort of games we need to bagging a few goals in. Much improvement needed in the second half #COYBIG #IRLGIB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes David McGoldrick!! Ireland need to kick on now #IRLGIB #COYBIG<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Best Hurling game of the season so far #RTEGAA #KKvGAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some strike from Johnny Coen #kkvgal #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some save by Colm Callahan #KKvGAL #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Some start to this game #RTEGAA #TYRDON<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unbelievable second half from the Toronto and unbelievable second half Kawhi #NBAFinals #Raptors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2nd game in a row &amp; maybe the last game at Oracle &amp; Warriors fans leaving, I know your getting blown out but you have to stay &amp; support the team they've given 3 titles in 4 years and if they get KD back for game 5 &amp; maybe game 6 &amp; 7 you still have a chance #NBAFinals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kawhi is dominating right now #NBAFinals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a block by Draymond #NBAFinals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't know how Toronto are only 4 points behind at half time #NBAFinals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warriors are hammered Toronto on rebounds in the 1st quarter #NBAFinals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even without KD Golden State have no excuses tonight they have Steph, Draymond, Boogie and now Klay's back #NBAFinals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't get the negativity around the result, Denmark have been using us as a training match for the last 2 years, tonight we fought back and got a positive result #COYBIG #DENIRL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would have took that before the game and I'll definitely take after the position we were in with 10mins to go! 7 points from possible 9 is an excellent start to the group! Come on Ireland!! üáÆüá™ #COYBIG #DENIRL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YES!!! Get in Shane Duffy! üáÆüá™ #COYBIG #DENIRL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on Ireland!! üáÆüá™ #COYBIG #DENIRL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Obviously not gonna pretend I know anything really about Daniel James cause I don‚Äôt but what I do like about the deal is the low risk in terms of a fee. We‚Äôve got burned so many times recently with fee‚Äôs so this a smart piece of business #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welcome Daniel James üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dreadful from England at the back again #NEDENG #NationsLeague<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Good header that from De Ligt #NEDENG #nationsleague<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man City spent ¬£50million on Kyle Walker just two years ago &amp; now about to spend ‚Ç¨50million on another RB yet United don‚Äôt wanna Spend ¬£50mill Wan-Bissaka who could be United‚Äôs RB for 10 years #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even though he‚Äôs a bit inconsistent &amp; nearly 29 ¬£88.5m is a great deal for Madrid #RealMadrid #Hazard<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Milit√£o ‚úÖ Jovic ‚úÖ Mendy medical (Apparently)  Hazard will get done   This how big clubs in a rebuild act @ManUtd #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some excellent defense from the Raptors early but Klay is starting to get a hot hand already #NBAFinals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Give him the title, X that was amazing üëèüëè #BGT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another convincing performance from Tipp #RTEGAA #ClarevTipp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs some score by Podge Collins #CLAREvTIPP #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1-14 to 3 points in the second half is pretty embarrassing from a Waterford point of view #WATvLIM #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Limerick were excellent in that first half but poor from Waterford not to take advantage of that breeze #WATvLIM #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We had some dodgy in our time during title races but nothing like that lot, they seem to get one a week<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can‚Äôt wait for City to slip as I said all season it‚Äôs written in the starts for that lot win the league #LFC #MCFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>&amp; this lot wonder why no one wants them to win the league ? The most sensitive fan base in the world! An ex Barca &amp; Everton player celebrates a goal for a team he use to play for against Liverpool a rival of another team he use to play for &amp; somehow he‚Äôs in the wrong #Liverpool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is wrong with Spurs ? They‚Äôre gonna end getting this game called off #BOUTOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ireland getting done by a dodgy decision at a under age European championship what a shock #U17EURO #COYBIG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Valencia just as bad #ARSVAL #UEL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Arsenal are all over the place #ARSVAL #UEL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚ÄòBarca haven‚Äôt seen a team like us‚Äô &amp; ‚Äòthey were shades of Cruyff‚Äôs Ajax in our team‚Äô this lot sometimes üòÇüòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh my god what a player! That's ridiculous #BarcaLIV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a ball that was by Alba to setup #Bar√ßaLFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two hours after he had to publicly ask you for a statement, I have to laugh at your bio ‚Äò25 years of campaigning for equality in football‚Äô unless your an Irish catholic who gets dogs abuse every week #JamesMcClean #KickItOut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚ÄòAct in a manner that is befitting of LFC‚Äô üòÇüòÇüòÇ this is the club that printed t-shirts to support a person who was found guilty of racially abusing a fellow player #Liverpool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@talkSPORT @thedavidseaman @Juventusen I know he use to play for Arsenal &amp; all but surely he can‚Äôt believe that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent finish that by Van de Beek #TOTAJX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSundayGame @RTEsport All the people complaining about the lack of football can you tell me when there‚Äôs been a football season in the last 10-15years that was remotely close to the Hurling last year ? Last seasons football improve a bit with Super 8‚Äôs but still no where near the season Hurling has<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkySportsPL Young kid says something stupid &amp; when he‚Äôs a older &amp; starts having success people drag these up to drag him down<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don‚Äôt get why everyone‚Äôs going mad about Rio becoming technical director it‚Äôs not as if whoever takes the job is gonna have much of say anyway Woodward &amp; the Glazers will still control everything #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You couldn‚Äôt make this up him &amp; the rest of media have been banging on about Poch needing to a win a trophy to considered a top quality manager &amp; to be considered a success at Spurs but Klopp doesn‚Äôt at Liverpool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dreadful second half performance! That‚Äôs top 4 gone &amp; the season over #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd drop De Gea for the last two games as Neville just said he needs the summer just to get away from football for a while #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That build up play for that goal was brilliant! Excellent start hopefully we can keep it up #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Juan Mata!!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!!üáæüá™#MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was some ball from Walker to Jesus #BURMCI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What happened in the Leeds &amp; Villa game ? Just seen bits of videos and it looked mental #LeedsvVilla<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know he's been talked about a good lot this season and this has been said loads but James Maddison is a brilliant footballer. The cross for the goal was quality and the way he links up Leicester is brilliant #LEIARS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unbelievable control that from Maddison #LEIARS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a strike by Babel #FULCAR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brilliant goal that by West Ham, the ball from Arnautoviƒá was quality &amp; the finish was equally as good #TOTWHU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wha a touch that was from Arnautoviƒá #TOTWHU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's probably Tyreek Hill gone from the Chiefs #NFLDraft<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even though the Packers signed Turner we needed more OL depth because the OL has been banged up a lot the last couple of seasons, Jenkins is good, much needed pick #GoPackGo #NFLDraft<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Need to go offense with this pick #GoPackGo #NFLDraft<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Packers need to draft offense tonight we‚Äôve spent enough draft capital &amp; FA money on defense #GoPackGo #NFLDraft<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Didn't expect this #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Straube_Dylan @ParkerMoes If we don't win another SB with Rdogers it's not Gute's fault it's Ted Thompson he wasted most of Aaron's prime by not building a defense.  I get what your saying about Gary but he hasn't played a game yet for GB so you got give him a chance as well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Straube_Dylan @ParkerMoes It's his second draft if this was 4th/5th I'd agree with what your saying but you gotta give the guy a chance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParkerMoes Remember last year when we traded down everyone went mad but we then ended up getting an excellent CB in Jaire Alexander and extra 1st round pick ? Got trust in Gute and Pettine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welcome to the Packers Reshan Gary! Let's go! #GoPackGo #NFLDraft<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here we go #NFLDraft #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TJ Hockenson is an excellent TE but the 8th pick seems a bit high for a TE #NFLDraft<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you were gonna take a QB how do you not take Dwayne Haskins ? #NFLDraft<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That pick was a surprise #NFLDraft #Raiders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jets with the FA signings, drafting Williams and Darnold with a year of NFL experience now behind him might actually be half decent next season #NFLDraft<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üëÄüëÄ #NFLDraft<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Its gonna be Kyler #NFLDraft<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lot of people talking about Pogba should not be the team of the year &amp; they‚Äôre probably right but why isn‚Äôt anyone talking about how Alexander-Arnold is in it ? You can‚Äôt convince he‚Äôs had a better season Wan-Bisska or Doherty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Liverpool's luck is in that much this season it wouldn't surprise if City fuck up against Burnley #PremierLeague<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The gulf in quality between United and City in both the style of football and the quality of players is ridiculous. I honestly don't if we can make it up in the next 5 years #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just hope this doesn't get embarrassing #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the f*ck is wrong with De Gea ? #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does Silva not get mentioned as often in the greatest PL player debate yes he doesn't score the goals like Ronaldo &amp; Henry but as a player technically he's the probably the best I've ever seen #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>United post Ferguson and everything that's wrong with United atm just summed up there under Fergie no way would have that been kicked out, we would have been ruthless, played on and attacked #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Much improved from United, a lot more effort and energy #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Profit*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚ÄòBig clear out needed‚Äô ‚ÄòWe need a rebuild‚Äô has been said a million times before &amp; yes it needs to happen but it‚Äôs not going to. 2/3 will leave 2/3 will come in that‚Äôs it no massive rebuild or clear out will happen #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I‚Äôd happily pay for Pogba‚Äôs plane ticket to Madrid, used to once worry about losing him now I can‚Äôt wait to get rid #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have always maintained we should have waited to give Solskjaer job &amp; still stick by that but these spineless so called players have let him &amp; the club down big time today #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shambles #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Playoff basketball has everything #NBAPlayoffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree with this if true, this ‚Äòsuperstar‚Äô policy is killing us, we need to get players who want to play for the team &amp; can improve it not sell shirts #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Football bloody hell... #MCITOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or Maybe not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3-1 on up aggregate with two goals &amp; they bottle it, Spurs really do their best to beat PSG for the biggest bottle job team title #MCITOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once again Sterling is player of the season #MCITOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep course I‚Äôm missed the first 15mins of the City &amp; Spurs game #MCITOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@undisputed @ShannonSharpe The only thing that would be better is his shoulder from all that rest it would be getting right now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don‚Äôt get me wrong Young needs to go, he‚Äôs not good enough footballer for United anymore but there‚Äôs absolutely no need for the racist abuse #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let‚Äôs go! Time to tie up series #ThunderUp #NBAPlayoffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whoever signs De Ligt will win the CB lottery 19 years old &amp; already at 7/8 CB in the world #JUVAJX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don‚Äôt sleep on this Ajax team, what a header from De Ligt #JuveAjax<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What has happened to David De Gea ? #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This Barca defense is there to be had it‚Äôs just getting the on ball that‚Äôs the problem #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never a penalty #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Obviously very long shot but we‚Äôve been here before, come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So basically they are entitled to win it ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This guy is ridiculous, there‚Äôs no athlete like him at the moment #MILDET<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really OKC can you please just make a couple of 3‚Äôs ? This is ridiculous #ThunderUp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3PT shooting &amp; offensive fouls are killing OKC #ThunderUp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor enough first half from OKC but least still only 6 points behind #ThunderUp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OKC needs to try slow this down a bit #ThunderUp #NBAPlayoffs #NBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Playoff time! Let‚Äôs go!! #ThunderUp #NBAplayoffs #NBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Greatest sporting comeback #TheMasters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TIGER!!!! #theMasters  https://t.co/H4SN22kaLd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brilliant from Tiger #TheMasters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tiger might actually be doing this!! #TheMasters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on Tiger!! #TheMasters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I repeat player of the season<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Sterling was at Liverpool &amp; City paid ¬£50mil for him I thought he was well overrated &amp; overpriced but god he‚Äôs turned into some player, my player of the season #CRYMCI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DeChambeau what a shot üëè #TheMasters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kyle Lowry is an excellent basketball player but seriously how do you not score at least 1 point ? #NBA #NBAPlayoffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow üòÆüòÆ the finish to this is what the playoffs are about #NBA #NBAPlayoffs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wow üòÆüòÆ #BGT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got the 3 points but an awful performance the last few performances a tad worrying #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another good penalty from Pogba #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck off #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor first half #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Pogba!! No stupid run up just smashed it! Come on United!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got away with one there #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#TheVictim what a brilliant series, so harrowing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chelsea fans being racist what a shock #Chelsea<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good first half #ThunderUp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ThunderUp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Obviously gutted about but after the first 20mins thought we were very good. Thought Fred was excellent, the last 3-4 games he started to come into his own hopefully more to come from him #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Grew into the game in the last 15mins of the first half but once again conceding to a sloppy goal #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How does Busquets always get away with everything ? #MANBAR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know it‚Äôs Barca we‚Äôre playing but that‚Äôs kind of embarrassing #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don‚Äôt be reactionary but 11% possession after 15mins, 1-0 down...goodnight #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sweeterthejuic1 @btsportfootball Never said it wasn‚Äôt every premier league ground is dead out from a corner at Palace but yet everyone romanticizes about how great Anfield is but after YNWA at the start of every game it‚Äôs just the same as every other ground...no atmosphere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üêêüêêüêêüêê #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Deulofeu what a goal #FACup #WATWOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That Arsenal result is big for us, need to get back to winning ways now next week #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Ireland!!! Unbelievable achievement ‚òòÔ∏è #HK7s @IrishRugby<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent first half from Ireland! Big seven minutes ahead! #HK7s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the actual fuck ??? #BGT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a cross that is by De Bruyne &amp; that‚Äôs probably game over already #MCIBHA #FACup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jordan Conroy is ridiculous #HK7s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ThunderUp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don‚Äôt get me wrong I know United got lucky decisions under Fergie that helped us win titles but Jesus that lot seem to get a lucky decision every game<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pogba has ability to play for Madrid or Barca so whilst I don‚Äôt like it I can accept him talking about move but Lukaku is nowhere never good to enough to play for them...I‚Äôd put him in the bin for thinking this #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@talkSPORT @talkSPORTDrive Hypocrites never any outrage when Rangers players/fans incite hatred<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Day*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do United seem to have this policy of not starting negations on new contracts until there‚Äôs only 18 amounts left on them Herrera is all but certain to be off to PSG &amp; every it becomes increasingly likely that Dave will leave as well #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Soem save that #MCICAR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is gonna be cricket score #MCICAR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@btsportfootball @alexrae1969 @chris_sutton73 It‚Äôs funny how they fall for Chris Sutton every time they‚Äôll never learn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can‚Äôt wait to hear what  @ColinCowherd has to say about Rudd today probably crap as usual #TheHerd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FirstTake @maxkellerman Well done Russ you just did something that hasn‚Äôt been done since Wilt so to say congratulations well have a debate we have nearly every week instead of just talking about how great of a basketball player you are<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_scottsaunders How can you be the GOAT if you are the 5th best player in the world ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seeing the same old tweets a lot of the players are shit, the rot begins at the top of the club, need a big a clear, etc...&amp; all very true but nothing changes so there‚Äôs not point in keeping repeating the same stuff #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can‚Äôt see us making top 4 we have too many mistakes in us we are gonna drop at least 6 more points not including this game between now &amp; the end of the season #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The amount of mistakes that‚Äôs crept into our game recently is worrying #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another chance missed we can't keep missing these #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ever since Pogba got sent off against PSG he's gone back to been Pogba for most of his United career #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Started off brilliantly but since their goal we've just let them grow into the game, I have a bad feeling we are gonna rue them Rom and Jesse chances #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heads are bit gone since they scored #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should be 3-0 up but a couple of poor finishes and a bit of poor defending its now 1-1 #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First Lukaku now Jesse hope we don't rue these chances later #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes McTominay!!! Absolutely delighted for him! Come on United!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a chance Lukaku #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Have to see it again but that pass from Russell looked well forward #R92ST #ChampionsCup<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@btsportrugby I‚Äôm all for protecting but that‚Äôs not a red he dipped his head into the tackle, yellow at the very max<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>YES!!!! @leinsterrugby unbelievable phase play at the end. 39 phases &amp; no penalty #LEIvULS #ChampionsCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Adam Byrne!! #LEIvULS #ChampionsCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor enough first half from Leinster but least still only two points behind big 40mins needed in the second half #LEIvULS #ChampionsCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wasn‚Äôt great but we got the win #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Tony Martial!!! Needed that #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We were poor until the goal but since then we‚Äôve played some excellent need to be more clinical in the final third though #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great piece of defending by Smalling #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now let‚Äôs kick on from here #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Marcus Rashford!! Excellent play for Shaw!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs possible but Mata has got even slower since the last time I seen him play #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So this morning Pogba today was talking about wanting Solksajer to stay&amp;this afternoon he‚Äôs talking up a move to Madrid. I was never his biggest fan but the way he‚Äôs bucked himself in the last few months has really swayed me about him&amp;now he‚Äôs just swayed back the other way #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sad day for Offaly Hurling but no need but it‚Äôs been coming a long time a proper development structure needs to be put in place to get Offaly back to any where near challenging but unfortunately don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs gonna happen @OffalyTracker #GAA #OffalyGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HailRodgers12 Prepared to be disappointed we never any top free agents<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@packers Are actually gonna be active this year ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He‚Äôs Irish so the FA don‚Äôt care<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Ol√© came in we were 11 points off top 4, everyone saying we had no hope in the CL &amp; nothing to play for this season. We are now 3 points off 3rd, in a Champions League QF &amp; in a FA Cup QF. We reacted well to the loss to PSG no reason we can‚Äôt do it again next Saturday #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Talking about a player that didn‚Äôt play today...strange man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shite game but still had enough chances to win it. We were still in Paris the first 30 mins &amp; ultimately that probably cost us the game #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get Martial on #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Much better from us but we need a goal soon #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lukaku hit that first time #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We've been poor but still don't know how we haven't scored, we need to get a goal early in the second half #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How have we not scored ? #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No real energy, Pogba out wide hasn't worked move him into midfield and go 4-3-3 #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Post twice already, don't say its gonna be one of those days #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get Pogba in midfield and get more control in the game #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah so close! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Definitely a bit of a hangover from Wednesday need to get on the ball more #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ireland once again not clinical enough so far #IREvFRA #GuinnessSixNations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not confident about this game they have such a great home record &amp; also feel we might a have a hangover from Wednesday #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Rory Best! Good start Ireland!! #IREvFRA #GuinnessSixNations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big opportunity for United today, really hope there isn‚Äôt a hangover from Wednesday! Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just got even bigger #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I‚Äôd buy Ward-Prowse just for the set piece ability alone, can‚Äôt think of any player in England or even Europe that has better free-kick &amp; set piece delivery than at the moment #SOUTOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some strike that by Knockaert #CRYBHA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rtenews @jackiefox_ @SimonCumbersMF Obviously a good thing but this is just another thing to appease the West &amp; try distract from the Khashoggi murder &amp; the starvation of millions of men, women &amp; children in Yemen just to name a couple of things<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mrjakehumphrey Stark reminder it is...A club like Ajax should be at this level in Europe every season but they can't match Europe's elite for money.

<|startoftext|>What is going on here ? üò≤üò≤ #AjaxRealMadrid #UCL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a goal by Tadic #AjaxRealMadrid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Knew I made the right decision choosing the Ajax game over Spurs #RealAjax<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent finish Neres #RealAjax<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That would have been some goal #FULCHE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sarri has no bottle about him at all a week ago Kepa showed him the height of disrespect now he‚Äôs starting today #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reminder that the Merseyside Derby is the sh*test Derby of them all which always ends up either Liverpool bartering Everton 3/4-0 or Liverpool dominating them for 90mins &amp; nicking a goal in the last min #MerseysideDerby<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Moyes &amp; Balague doing the punditry for El Clasico on Premier Sports the only channel I can watch it on...great #ElCl√°sico<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Bournemouth didn‚Äôt have a shot today,  I‚Äôm 21 I‚Äôve been watching football since I was 4 &amp; I can‚Äôt remember ever seeing or hearing of a team didn‚Äôt have at least one shot in a game...no shots that‚Äôs dreadful #BOUMCI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I repeat #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was close, first half we were poor but the second half was much better! Another 3 points! Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That fucking technique, just run &amp; smash in the corner #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a finish that is #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get in Lukaku!!! Come on!!!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since Lukaku scored we‚Äôve offered nothing going forward #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fucking hell #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great turnaround &amp; let‚Äôs finish this off! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lukaku!!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dalot has done more for United in this game in 3mins than Sanchez did in 53mins #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Andreas Pereira!!!!! Wow #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor first half from us, yes we‚Äôve had chances but overall poor. The squad showing once again that the depth is poor without Jesse, Ander &amp; Tony  there is no real press &amp; a lack of innovation in attack #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please say it‚Äôs not one of those days #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lukaku at least get it on target #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have to score there #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They deserve that after the first 5mins we‚Äôve taken our foot off the gas &amp; they‚Äôve been the better team #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent result for us we need to make the most of it now #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wouldn‚Äôt have played Shaw today two big games coming that we need him for #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This why I don‚Äôt want VAR if it stays 1-1 or Spurs go on to win it the meltdown &amp; crying from Arsenal fans is gonna be glorious #TOTARS #NorthLondonDerby<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the world.

<|startoftext|>Of course it was<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Youngy!!! Get in!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tough 20mins ahead #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FFS #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why I always try avoid criticizing Lukaku during a game even if he deserves it cause he can pop up and score a goal #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Lukaku!! Come on United!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CameronStebbing Follow me and I'll DM you one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wasn't a great first half but we've controlled for the most part #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Would have taken a point before the game &amp; then with all the injuries I certainly take it now #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Obviously still a half to go in this but we have 2 games next week. Bringing Lingard was senseless also these injuries the lack of quality in depth we have #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Can‚Äôt wait to get City away in the next round #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I‚Äôve always been not matter how positive the results we should wait until the end of the season to make a decision on Ol√© but winning at Stamford bridge has got my mind changing #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RFFH Agreed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pogba was brilliant tonight but Herrera should have been BBC‚Äôs MOTM got the first goal &amp; has been absolutely everywhere on the pitch tonight #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait Sarri just bought on a defender ? #CHEMNU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Need to get on the ball more #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is that a free kick ? I‚Äôm all for player protection but Hazard is over protected #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent first half from United solid at the back &amp; clinical in front of goal, need to keep it tight now &amp; don‚Äôt concede early in the second half #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pogba!!! What wonderful ball by Rashford as well #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Ander!! What a ball from Pogba #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do we play Young in big games ?  he always gets booked inside 20mins &amp; then can‚Äôt make a challenge for the rest game &amp; we caught out the side he‚Äôs defending #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hate been negative but Stamford bridge never goes right for us hopefully that changes tonight üáæüá™üôè #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anything good happened in the football tonight ? üëÄ #EuropaLeague<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üëèüáÆüá™<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>last night they lost two of their best players in Neymar &amp; Cavani &amp; their replacements just slotted right in we lost Martial &amp; Lingard &amp; our replacements weren‚Äôt good. Obviously gutted we lost but least we found how far we are behind Europe‚Äôs elite &amp; how far we need to go #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With Ole I‚Äôve always been wait till the end of the season no matter how good the results are but people saying he shouldn‚Äôt get the job based on last night are stupid. We came up against better &amp; more experienced team last night. The depth &amp; quality in there squad showed...#MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesse &amp; Tony‚Äôs injuries really hope there not serious because as we‚Äôve seen tonight the depth in our squad is poor #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>to be back among Europe‚Äôs best &amp; this result won‚Äôt make or break Ole‚Äôs chances of getting the permanent job it‚Äôs how we react to it that will! Still a lot to play for this season so we need to push this result out of mind. My biggest concern about tonight is...#MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Obviously gutted about the result but even PSG without Cavani &amp; Neymar are an excellent team Mbappe in two years will be the best player in the world &amp; the way they control the ball in midfield is unbelievable &amp; even though we lost least it shows us how far we have to go...#MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They‚Äôre gonna get a 3rd &amp; maybe 4th here #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The tie is over &amp; this could get embarrassing #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This could get really bad #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is like watching the Seville last year can‚Äôt get any of the ball #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where is the free kick for that ??? #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Losing Martial &amp; Lingard for this game is bad but with Chelsea &amp; Liverpool coming up its worse #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They‚Äôve controlled the game, we can‚Äôt get any control at all &amp; now Lingard‚Äôs gone off &amp; Martial doesn‚Äôt look 100% could be tough second half #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only good thing that happened for United in that half was Young nearly putting Di Maria in the crowd #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very lucky there #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He‚Äôs gone here #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know he‚Äôs been quiet but losing Tony is the last thing we need #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They‚Äôve marked Pogba &amp; Martial out of the game #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the one thing I hate about the Champions League &amp; why I never watch leagues outside of England because every little touch &amp; a player is on the floor #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So exciting &amp; so nervous at the same time for tonight üáæüá™üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Raheem Sterling is unbelievable, for country that love to over-hype players they don't hype Sterling up enough #MCICHE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Carragher mugging off Chelsea and Arsenal at once absolutely brilliant #MCICHE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That might be single handedly the worst first half performance I've ever seen from a team, Chelsea shambles at the back &amp; for nothing really going forward #MCICHE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They might actually sack Sarri at half time #MCICHE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>City could rack up the goal difference here if they really want to #MCICHE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's some f*cking goal by Aguero #MCICHE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How did Aguero miss that ??? #MCICHE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chelsea's defense was all over the place there #MCICHE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They're dropping like files, even with Neymar I didn't really give us a chance but now with Cavani out, Meunier out, Verratti not 100% we have big in the first leg anyway #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine thinking France might give England a game, least I can focus on watching City &amp; Chelsea now #GuinessSixNations #ENGvFRA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great strike that by Eriksen #TOTLEI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not usually one to comment on the Female punditry debate because I think most male &amp; female pundits are pretty crap but have to say Br√≠d Stack was very good on RT√â tonight #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent game of football #KERvDUB #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a goal Con O'Callaghan #KERDUB #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Both teams have played some good stuff but Kerry deserve that they've just been the better team so far #KERDUB #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Forgot to mention earlier Dalot was excellent at RB been impressive nearly every time he played this hope to see more of him from now on #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wasn‚Äôt vintage from Ireland but the second half was much improved think the break week has come at a good time for Ireland #GuinnessSixNations #SCOvIRE #TeamOfUs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Keith Earls!! Absolutely brilliant from Carbery in the build up #GuinnessSixNations #SCOvIRE #TeamOfUs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wasn‚Äôt great first half from Ireland but we have the lead, improvements needed in the second half #GuinnessSixNations #SCOvIRE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mesut Ozil needs to see a doctor the guy is always sick #HUDARS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ye wanted Wenger out ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sexton got killed there, that‚Äôs surely a late hit #GuinnessSixNations #IREvSCO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Jacob Stockdale!!! #GuinnessSixNations #SCOvIRE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sexton never looked for comfortable taken that conversion probably should have let Murray take it #GuinnessSixNations #SCOvIRE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Conor Murray!!! #GuinnessSixNations #SCOvIRE #TeamOfUs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on Ireland!! ‚òòÔ∏è #GuinnessSixNations #SCOvIRE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sanchez should score there #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time take of Pogba &amp; Martial now #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Pogba!! Good pen #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First 10mins we were poor but we‚Äôve controlled the game since hopefully couple more goals early in the second half &amp; we can take off Pogba &amp; Martial &amp; give them a bit of a rest before Tuesday #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>United lucky there that‚Äôs a not a free kick #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh my god Anthony Martial!!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pogba!!! What a strike! Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have to admit don‚Äôt like the changes today but still enough out there to get the 3 points! Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenGrace_ If it was to get more money if we‚Äôre selling him why not sign him to a 3year deal? Also why are we signing fringe players to deals without a new permanent manager in place? Martial, Rashford &amp; De Gea are players nearly every manager in the world would have Jones&amp;Young not so much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously United ? I thought we were starting a new era #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Give me a break we should be bottom of this list, corruption capital of the world #Ireland<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#ThunderUp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lovely goal from City but have to question the defending from Arsenal they were defending so narrow and got Lichtsteiner caught so badly  #MCIARS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's awful defending from City #MCIARS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The second Iwobi tried dribble out of the back Arsenal were in trouble #MCIARS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wasn‚Äôt spectacular but look at Leicester‚Äôs results against the top 6 this season they‚Äôve been excellent so that‚Äôs a great 3 points! Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First 20mins we were excellent but sluggish after that, need to pick it up a bit more in the second half #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's some block from Shaw #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a ball from Pogba and great touch and finish from Rashford #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great cross from Shaw, Rashford should score there #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>United &amp; Leicester  City &amp; Arsenal  The Super Bowl   Happy Sunday everyone üòÄ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was bad, England defense was brilliant &amp; deserved to win but Ireland lacked any innovation in attack #GuinnessSixNations #IREvENG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not to check that pass is a disgrace might just cost Ireland the Six Nations  #GuinnessSixNations #IREvENG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is just not Ireland‚Äôs day too many mistakes + England‚Äôs defence #GuinnessSixNations #IREvENG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>England deserve to be ahead, a lot of poor decision making &amp; lack innovation in attack to counter England‚Äôs defense #GuinnessSixNations #IREvENG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How long did Ireland have to hold up Slade there before they would have got a penalty ? Absolutely ridiculous #IREvENG #GuinnessSixNations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Cian Healy!! #GuinnessSixNations #IREvENG #TeamOfUs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on Ireland!!! ‚òòÔ∏èüíö #GuinnessSixNations #IREvENG #TeamOfUs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's some finish by Redmond #BURSOU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs awful from France #GuinnessSixNations #FRAvWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs an absolute howler #GuinnessSixNations #FRAvWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Obviously difficult conditions but the kicking so far has been awful #FRAvWAL #GuinnessSixNations #SixNations2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man the NBA is crazy sometimes #NBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Martial news has just made my week üòÅ 6 months Mourinho wanted to trade him for Willian so glad he didn‚Äôt get his way #MUFC #Martial2024<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üé∂Tony Martial he came from France the English press said he had no chance üé∂ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep of course Chelsea get battered 4-0 after we drew #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCoughlan19 It‚Äôs definitely an advantage for us but they still have Cavani &amp; Mbappe up against Phil Jones &amp; Ashley Young üò¨üò¨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Obviously Neymar is a big loss for PSG but I‚Äôd much rather Mbappe was the one out, I think we could deal with Neymar‚Äôs pace but our defence has no chance with Mbappe‚Äôs #MUFC #PSG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shouldn't been in that position in the first place but excellent comeback from United need to show that's a blip and get back to winning ways sunday #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YESSSSS!!!!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's just one those days aint it ? #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor first half, improvement needed in the second half #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rashford has to score there #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Chelsea away in the FA Cup what a shock #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RTEgaa So they took in an extra ‚Ç¨1.2mil in revenue ‚Ç¨500,000 went to local clubs &amp; ‚Ç¨200,000 went to international ones so by my calculations there‚Äôs ‚Ç¨500,00 left over so where did that go ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ThunderUp<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This game üé¢ #PatsChiefs #AFCChampionship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As I tweet this they get an INT of course #PatsChiefs #AFCChampionship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know this Chiefs offense is brilliant but I still don‚Äôt know how they‚Äôve carried this defense to the AFC championship game cause it‚Äôs absolutely trash #PatsChiefs #AFCChampionship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Zuerlein clutch #RamsSaints<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a throw Jared Goff #RamsSaints<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seen a lot of 'That's cruel on Fulham' they had the ball with 40 seconds to go on the halfway line &amp; instead of taking it to the corner and taking the point they lobbed it up with no one in box, straight to Lloris...they got what they deserved #FULTOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent try from Leinster #WASvLEI<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Nadal_LH_Fan Bit like watching United under LVG loads possession no end product but least United under LVG were solid at the back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chelsea were dreadful in that first half, defensively all over the place &amp; offering nothing going forward #ARSCHE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs easily the worst performance under Ole, very complacent #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shit üòï we‚Äôve been very complacent this whole game tbh #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wasn‚Äôt the greatest first half but we have lead hopefully the play is better in the second &amp; score couple more goals #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Marcus Rashford what a goal üî•üî• #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Some excellent penalties in that from Derby #SOTvDER<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>David De Gea best keeper in the world end of #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still big job to do in the second half started looking scrappy at the back towards the end of the first half #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Marcus!!! Brilliant counter attack #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Much needed touchdown for the Colts #KCvsIND<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Tyreek Hill was picked in the fifth round of the NFL Draft...wow! His speed is amazing #KCvsIND<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big win for Leinster especially with the injuries &amp; also to get the try bonus point &amp; Toulouse coming out of the game with nothing #LEIvTOU<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Well that was a great first half #NationalChampionship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That blitz was ridiculous #NationalChampionship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What am I watching ? Alabama's defense is getting torched, Tua throwing picks #NationalChampionship<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wow. #NationalChampionship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would have preferred McDaniels but with his past of pulling out of jobs at the last second + he might be a clash personality with Rodgers so like the idea of Matt LeFleur most important was to get a young offensive mind reinvent the offense üíöüíõ #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The Cowboys have actually won a playoff game #DALvsSEA #NFLWildCard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unbelievable catch by Baldwin #DallasVsSeattle #NFLWildCard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a catch Tyler Lockett #DALvsSEA #NFLWildCard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awful start from Seattle #NFLWildCard #DALvsSEA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uh oh #NFLWildCard #ColtsVsTexans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Playoff time üèàüèà @NFLUK @SkySportsNFL #NFLWildCard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know there was a lot of changes but that was poor #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I for one can't wait for Pogba, Rashford, Martial, Lingard &amp; the rest to be back in team, this has nearly than some of the performances under Mourinho &amp; once again a lot of these players proven they aren't go enough for United #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don‚Äôt deserve to be 2-0 some words needed at half time! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a ball by Sanchez #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Lukaku!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For months I wanted Fred or Pereira to start instead of Matic but today is proven how wrong I was, he‚Äôs clearly after Pogba &amp; Herrera the best midfielder at the club #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Mara!! Good penalty #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fred, McTominay &amp; Pereira really struggling to control the game #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! üáæüá™ #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Paul George is unbelievable #ThunderUp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For once a game that was really hyped up actually lived up to it, brilliant game that #MCILIV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some finish that #MCILIV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Obviously need to see a better angle but that Liverpool chanced looked over the line #MCILIV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ThunderUp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just seen a tweet that reminded me Herrera‚Äôs contract is up in the summer @ManUtd get him signed up now!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #MOTD four United matches in a row it‚Äôs been a while since that‚Äôs happened #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lindelof was exceptional tonight really showing in recent weeks that he can become an excellent defender #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chelsea results üëÄüëÄ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A clean sheet!!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unbelievable burst from Pogba considering its the 93rd but he's got to try &amp; pull that back to Lukaku #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another excellent performance from Rashford #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes!! Get in Marcus!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How's that not a red ? #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Rom!!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great tackle by Jones #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ThunderUp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Titans really needed that #SNFonNBC #TitansColts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@packers Embarrassing major changes needed in the offseason<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bailly has potential to be an excellent defender but he can be so reckless and until he cuts it out of his game he wouldn't move to the next level #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Lukaku!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rashford absolutely brilliant today #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Out from the goal conceded just before half time absolutely brilliant first half. Need to keep on the front foot now cause that defense clearly can't be trusted #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FFS is too much to ask for one clean sheet #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some of the passes Matic has played today have been brilliant #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Marcus!!! Deserves that been excellent in the first half #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Pogba!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's brilliant from Rashford to setup Pogba! Get in!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs some strike by Camarasa #MOTD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only for Craig Gordon Celtic would dead &amp; buried in this game #OldFirm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gerrard actually has Rangers playing well...unfortunately #OldFirm #RANCEL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never trust City<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Pogba!!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Pogba!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Matic!!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ThunderUp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ThunderUp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That finish was mad #PITvsNO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Antonio Brown is unbelievable #PITvsNO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is that PI on Joe Haden ? #PITvsNO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Packers Win!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCoughlan19 @SkyFootball Wouldn't even let him off as its Christmas üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Packer s OL is trash major fix needed in the off-season #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyFootball @RCoughlan19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great strike by Eriksen #EVETOT<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RCoughlan19 @ElliotHackney Clever pen that üî•<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>About to turn on @BBCMOTD for the first time in a while üáæüá™#MOTD #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a comeback from @leinsterrugby!!üíô #LEIvCON<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leinsterrugby YEEEEEEESSSS!!! üíôüíô<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Michael Conlan!!! üáÆüá™ @mickconlan11<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was brilliant, in the first half I was saying "its only Cardiff" but under Mourinho there's no way we would have won that 5-1 #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesse!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Forget Full backs now our Centre backs are crossing the half way line #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good penalty by Lingard!! Come on United!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know it‚Äôs only Cardiff but that was brilliant to watch, controlling the game, lovely attacking moves, wingers running at people &amp; full backs actually crossing the half way line! More in the second half please #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs amazing goal from United!! Come on!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck sake we are never keeping a clean sheet again are we ? #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Marcus that‚Äôs stupid #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great move &amp; great strike by Herrera!! Come on!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Marcus!!! Come on!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! üáæüá™#MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Young &amp; Jones are gonna play for United forever aren‚Äôt they ? #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It really is their year isn‚Äôt?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Townsend oh my god üò±üò± #MCICRY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Such a special talent, pity it‚Äôs never worked out for him at a bigger club<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCoughlan19 Exactly, United fans everywhere standing up for Pogba whose done nothing for United in the 2 &amp; years he's been at the club compared to Keane whose done everything for the club<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some United fans turning on Keane cause he criticized this is the same Roy Keane whose done more for United than any member of our current &amp; none of them wouldn‚Äôt lace Keane‚Äôs boots #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Why would they have to fight ISIS if they are defeated ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not Pogba's biggest defender &amp; obviously wasn't there but I can almost guarantee that this didn't happen #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree with Sherwood as much as I would like Poch think we only have a very slim chance of getting him and that chance is him publicly saying he wants to leave, Levy won't accept any money for him #TheDebate #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not Dele Alli's biggest fan but he's grown on me tonight, brilliant bit of shithousery there #ARSTOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great finish that #ARSTOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also if things continue to go wrong the players know that it‚Äôs gonna be put on them because Solskjaer is only temporary manager. Players have no excuse now not to perform #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There‚Äôs actually people outraged that #Solskjaer is interim manager, like did they think we‚Äôd get a new permanent manager half way through a season when most good managers are in jobs&amp;clubs won‚Äôt let them go mid-season. Solskjaer only real job is to put smiles back on fans faces<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@caulmick @campaignforleo "People need to understand that if you borrow money you have to pay it back" So when will the taxpayers be getting back the billions that the banks borrowed to save themselves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love when journalists go into press conferences ask managers questions they know they aren't gonna get answers to &amp; yet they still persist with the same questions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As much as I'd like Poch just can't see him leaving Spurs &amp; if he does its gonna be for Madrid or PSG #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lol even a CNN political show is now talking about Mourinho been sacked üòÇüòÇ Hated. Adored. Never ignored. #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sky Sports News whole programming titles for today has changed to "Jose Mourinho sacked" can't remember doing ever for another manager that's been sacked, we really the biggest in club #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs only part of the issue sorted still bigger problems need a proper recruitment process not all this erratic buying, need to appoint manager that has history of playing attacking football &amp; loads problems at the board level to sort out #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ThunderUp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great play by Carolina #NOvsCAR #MondayNightFootball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HailRodgers12 1. Hire Lincoln Riley 2. New OL (Except Bakhtiari) 3. Pass Rush 4. Safety or Safeties  5. Cut Cobb find a new second veteran WR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mbappe is gonna retire Ashely Young #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Obviously, can‚Äôt believe some people thought because the club hadn‚Äôt tweeted in a few hours that something was happening, he isn‚Äôt gonna be sacked until it‚Äôs impossible to qualify for the CL #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great effort by Joe Haden to get his feet down on that INT #NEvsPIT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a catch by Washington #NEvsPIT #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's an amazing special teams play by New England #PITvsNE #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Touchdown Jamaal Williams!! #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyway done with United it‚Äôs time for Packers football #GoPackGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>E.M.B.A.R.R.A.S.S.I.N.G #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only solace I can take from today is that De Gea is still the best GK in the league &amp; that's pretty bad its the only positive I can take #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can this board not see that half of these players are shit &amp; need to moved on the other half don't wanna play for the manager anymore ? #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sit off, invite pressure &amp; eventually concede! Don‚Äôt get me wrong players have big role in how poor we have been this season but the manager has the biggest one #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't how we are level but we are #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Jesse!!! Hopefully that will wake them up #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great cross by Targett for Southampton's goal #SOUARS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man I love Keano what I'd give to have a couple players with his mentality in the United dressing these days #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can you hate Christmas when you see stuff like this ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolute dime from Baker #Browns #BroncosvsBrownsLive<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What a kick by Sexton! Leinster are on a different level #LEIvBAT #ChampionsCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs brilliant from James Lowe #LEIvBAT #ChampionsCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent rugby from Leinster, Brilliant 1-2 between Sexton &amp; Ringrose! #LEIvBAT #ChampionsCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Jack Conan! Great reply to Bath‚Äôs early penalty #LEIvBAT #ChampionsCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on @leinsterrugby!! üíôüíô #LEIvBAT #ChampionsCup<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>There's people out there that don't think Mahomes is special #ChiefsChargers #LACvsKC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a move by Williams #ChiefsChargers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bad throw by Rivers #ChiefsChargers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OfficalGM @dink2k5 @TeleFootball @CDEccleshare So you don't care about your fans shouting racism ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeleFootball @CDEccleshare They do know they are only relevant in football because of their JEWISH owner ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great start to the new confidence &amp; supply agreement #LeadersQuestions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JDhelpteam I ordered a Jacket online &amp; collected it in store but I want to change the size can I go to my local JD Sports just change the size there &amp; then or would I have to send it &amp; back &amp; get a new size that way ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And yes I know most of the players are sh*t but the matter of the fact you can‚Äôt just get rid of 15-20 players &amp; a load of crap players ain‚Äôt an excuse for keeping a crap manager #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If we play like this Sunday (Which is likely) &amp; we lose he has to be fired #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Embarrassing #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on United!! üáæüá™#MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCoughlan19 Hence why I said important save as for De Gea he‚Äôs made one mistake that‚Äôs led to a goal this season not his fault he has non-league rate defenders playing in front of him üòÇ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Don‚Äôt get me wrong he‚Äôs decent enough &amp; probably should start ahead of Bellerin for Arsenal but world class is a big stretch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some on Arsenal fan tv just called Lichtsteiner a world class right back üòÇüòÇ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RCoughlan19 It‚Äôs not even that, it‚Äôs one game into the new season under a new manager who hasn‚Äôt been given much backing when you look at the signings they made, if you actually go look at the AFTV interviews some of them expected them to be playing like City after one game üòÇüòÇ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Shit...#MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Luke Shaw!!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How did Lukaku not score there ? #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Eric Bailly is an unbelievable defender #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Darmian getting a lot of hate on here tonight but tbh he's getting no help from Mata so he has to cover the LB and LW for Leicester #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First 15mins were excellent but more the same shit from last season after that. Only for Eric Bailly they'd be level or even ahead. Need to get on the ball more in the 2nd half #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They've been the better side the last 10mins need to get on the ball more #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RCoughlan19 Giroud is a decent option but Morata ahead of Batshuayi is crazy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The United team I want to see tonight is: De Gea; Lindelof, Smalling, Bailly, Shaw; Fred, Pereira, Pogba; Mata, Lukaku, Sanchez   The I Team expect is: De Gea; Lindelof,  Smalling, Shaw; McTominay, Fred, Fellaini; Mata, Lukaku, Sanchez   #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>United fan's can cry about Ed Woodward &amp; the Glazers all they want but the fact is we are ones allowing to get away with cause no matter what they do we keep buying tickets, jerseys, other merchandise &amp; we keep subscribing to Sky Sports &amp; BT Sports #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just thinking about it now it‚Äôs mad how #AthleticBilbao make loads of money from clubs paying the buyout clauses for their players yet they only bring in Basque players to replace them, while its admiral &amp; nice to think about you are never gonna be successful with that policy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulPogbaSix He hasn't failed though because he's not a football man he's a business man &amp; his one &amp; only job really is to make record profits for the Glazers every season which he does.

<|startoftext|>Atletico ain‚Äôt gonna let Godin go &amp; there is to many moving parts to do in 6 hours, you‚Äôll have to get a medical, Personal terms agreed &amp; a work permit. So I ain‚Äôt getting to excited &amp; neither should any other United fan #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Don't see the point of us signing a CB if one of Jones, Smalling or Rojo aren't leaving.

<|startoftext|>¬£71mil for a keeper that‚Äôs only played one international game, I know we‚Äôve said this a lot over the last 2-3 years but I think today is officially the day football went mad #Kepa #Chelsea<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrmichaelbarton I think the lack of excitement comes from lack of signings combined with the fact fans know the negative football that's probably gonna played this season. If we played like City/Liverpool there would be more excitement about the season &amp; less desperation for signings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If United ARE gonna sign someone before Thursday (Which I doubt they will) &amp; they can't get rid of one of Smalling, Jones or Rojo then what's the point of signing a CB &amp; having 6 at the club. Go out &amp; sign a RW a position where we have nobody for #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@URelliott Yeah but Mourinho is the United manager. I have no doubt if it was a different manager he‚Äôd wanna stay &amp; he‚Äôd tell Mino Raiola to stop shopping him around cause he does have genuine love for the club but as long as Mourinho is the boss he‚Äôll want out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@URelliott Cause doesn‚Äôt wanna be at United<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCoughlan19 I‚Äôm watching on Sky pal, if you go to google &amp; type ‚Äòreddit Hull vs Villa‚Äô you‚Äôll find a load of links there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sporf @realmadrid @adidasfootball United and Juve doing the same thing...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Villa scored the most headed goals in the championship last season so what do Hull do ? Leave Tommy Elphick unmarked from a corner #HULLvsVILLA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenGrace_ Hopefully we can get Toby he‚Äôs bit younger than Boateng but still experienced &amp; only has had one long term injury<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenGrace_ That‚Äôs just the last two seasons. It would be like signing Schweinsteiger again but least Schweinsteiger only cost ¬£10mil Boateng is gonna cost 4 or 5 times that  https://t.co/EVpaKr1ray<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenGrace_ There‚Äôs people saying he‚Äôs still world class &amp; he‚Äôs Bayern‚Äôs best defender. If he was still world class &amp; Bayern‚Äôs best defender they wouldn‚Äôt even consider selling him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could be the key on closing the gap on City &amp; also keeping ahead of Liverpool, Tottenham, Chelsea &amp; Arsenal #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Top quality signing that...#MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nadal_LH_Fan Yeah they probably would except Alderweireld who seems to wanna come<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nadal_LH_Fan If I‚Äôm not mistaken though they sold Kroos because he wanted out &amp; didn‚Äôt have long left on his contract. Boateng doesn‚Äôt want out likely he would actually prefer to stay at Bayern than come near the mess we are currently in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nadal_LH_Fan When you look at the appearances of last season Hummels &amp; S√ºle both made more appearances &amp; you have to ask yourself why Bayern are selling him if he‚Äôs still one of the best in the world ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We know why Tottenham are opening to selling Alderweireld cause they know he will walk for ¬£25mil next year but ask yourself why Bayern are opening to selling Boateng ? Cause they know he‚Äôs finished #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like we are signing every CB on the market...#MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unlikely to happen but we need more than just a CB &amp; if Ed doesn‚Äôt deliver he needs to resign or publicly explain why he didn‚Äôt get Mourinho‚Äôs targets #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCoughlan19 üòÇüòÇ Just saying some yer fans are ridiculous why can‚Äôt they just accept that ye spend big money like every other big club does these days, every club makes money back from sales but you don‚Äôt see their fans going on about net spend (Except Arsenal fans of course)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SergeMUFC We played that way most of last season when we had Lukaku, Pogba, Martial &amp; Lingard &amp; if you are saying Pogba is our playmaker he looks like doesn‚Äôt wanna be here or he would have came back with Lukaku, Rashford, Jones when Mourinho was begging players to comeback<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus may as well change their name to ‚ÄòNetSpend FC‚Äô considering that‚Äôs all they seem to talk about these days, that &amp; still crying about Ramos‚Äôs tackle on Salah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I‚Äôd prefer Maguire to Boateng tbh...the guy has become so injury prone &amp; he looked finished at the World Cup #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This isn‚Äôt preseason that was Man Utd for 6 months of last season #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Update: They have been able to string more than 3 passes together #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know it‚Äôs preseason but have United put 3 or 4 passes together in this game ? Cause if they have I can‚Äôt remember #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Of course Rom is cutting his holiday short to help the team, ultimate team player &amp; professional that lad unlike some players we have in the squad #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sanchez &amp; Pereira been the shining lights of this poor preseason #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nine days for Ed Woodward to get his finger out...tick-tock #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klopp got what he wanted...#MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is always an agenda in the media against United but all these headlines on tomorrow‚Äôs papers have been brought on by Mourinho #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FullTimeDEVILS He‚Äôs brought some it on himself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surely ¬£30mil for Rojo isn't true #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CR__MU West Ham, Newcastle &amp; Leicester<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hurling the greatest sport on the planet #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was some goal by Casey #CORLIM #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs some penalty by Dowling #CORLIM #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine think Gaileic football is better than hurling #CORLIM #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WHAT. A. SAVE. #RTEGAA #CORLIM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This years hurling championship üòçüòç #CORLIM #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good save by Nash #CORLIM #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs a great score by Hegarty #CORLIM #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great first half of hurling #CORLIM #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly what Limerick needed #CORLIM #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs some score #CORLIM #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brilliant save by Nicky Quaid #CORLIM #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aaron Gillane should have buried both of those goal chances, he obviously doesn‚Äôt play much football #CORLIM #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So thats Matic out for the start of the season &amp; Mourinho saying he might get one more signing but not two...great #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just seen Shaw is injured as well that means we've already picked for injuries. As I said results not the worry its the injuries #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Results aren't the biggest worry about this preseason, remember when we beat everyone in preseason &amp; lost to Swansea on the first day, the biggest problem has to be the injuries Smalling, Matic &amp; Valencia all picked up injuries already #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahh the good old days...#MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surely he has to get a run in the team this year been the best player on the tour so far &amp; can take a set piece as well which is something we don‚Äôt have in the squad #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Andreas Pereira üò±üò±üò± #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow Chisora üò±üò≥ #ChisoraTakam #WhyteParker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes @KatieTaylor!!! üáÆüá™ #KatieTaylor #WhyteParker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkySportsNews Yeah but they shouldn‚Äôt have tried to implement it for the first time in a World Cup year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clare have hit so many bad wides in ET #CLAvGAL #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No better sport than hurling #RTEGAA #CLAvGAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beautiful from Tony Kelly #CLAvGAL #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clare shot themselves in the foot with the last two Galway points #CLAvGAL #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs some score by Peter Duggan #CLAvGAL #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fair play to Clare, were awful the first 20mins but have been excellent since #RTEGAA #CLAvGAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent save by Donal Tuohy #RTEGAA #CLAvGAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs some score by Tony Kelly #RTEgaa #CLAvGAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rojo wouldn‚Äôt be the center back I would sell out of him Jones &amp; Smalling but if we can get ¬£25mil + a few mill in add ons we are getting a very good deal #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alex is such a waste of a contestant #LoveIsland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good too see Fergie doing well üôå #MUFC  https://t.co/ndi8cI8aXe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TonightShowTV3 @campaignforkate What we also won‚Äôt forget is how many children Fine Gael have made homeless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don‚Äôt like Martial‚Äôs attitude but if this is true how can you expect any footballer to miss the birth of their child &amp; stay on a tour, Mourinho needs to stop this bullshit #MUFC  https://t.co/PpQHzvxHuF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GunnerEesa24 He‚Äôs won more European trophies in 20 years of management than ye have in your entire history<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@URelliott Pity we don‚Äôt have anyone to cross the ball...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@utdreport Well we probably ain‚Äôt getting him then cause don‚Äôt they want like 60mil+ for him<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Dave_Saves1 We were awful last year we were just lucky everyone behind us was worse, we got embarrassed out of the CL &amp; the league cup &amp; Chelsea were a team in turmoil going into the FA Cup final &amp; we still managed to loose to them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dave_Saves1 I know. Don‚Äôt want be negative but we are a mess right now, can‚Äôt get our signings done, players wanna leave, our top scout is leaving &amp; last night even though it was a preseason friendly to only register one shot on target against the worst side in the MLS is a worrying sign<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dave_Saves1 We ain‚Äôt getting a LB unfortunately, we‚Äôll be lucky to get a RW &amp; a CB at this rate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dave_Saves1 Exactly, the only way you sell Martial &amp; only bring in one attacker &amp; improve is if you get Bale or someone of that caliber which ain‚Äôt gonna happen. What we need to do is, keep Martial, get a RW &amp; a CB &amp; keep Pogba cause there is reports he wants to leave to<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If we sell Martial &amp; bring in another attacker that‚Äôs not improving that‚Äôs just replacing the only way we improve by selling Martial is by bringing into the attackers (which ain‚Äôt gonna happen) #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@utdreport Don‚Äôt brag about the being the richest club in the world then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know it‚Äôs only preseason but only one shot on target against the lowest ranked team in the MLS is worrying #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pereira the only good thing in this game can‚Äôt wait to watch him...out on loan this season üòû #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If United are serious about gettin Harry Maguire they‚Äôd be stupid not try offering Jones or Smalling as a part of a deal, it could kill two birds with one stone:   1) Gets one of Jones &amp; Smalling out of the club  2) Might make Leicester more likely to sell   #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know it‚Äôs a preseason friendly but that‚Äôs potentially the worst half of football I‚Äôve watched #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First injury of the season already üò© #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If he‚Äôd done that in match that means anything I‚Äôd be sick right now #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How did Bailly miss that ?? #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>David Clifford to the rescue #MONvKER #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kerry not been great today but David Clifford is a future star for them #MONvKER #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not turning over the channel to watch Tiger cause if I do I know he‚Äôll bottle it (Hope he wins though) #TheOpen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some kick out that #MONvKER #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3 wasted chances by Monaghan #MONvKER #RTE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great take &amp; the finish to match by McManus #MONvKER #RTE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was a brilliant game of football #KILvGAL #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope that red card doesn‚Äôt kill a great game #KILvGAL #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs a great score by Paddy Brophy #KILvGAL #RTEGAA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Nadal_LH_Fan If we are miles behind City &amp; Liverpool by Christmas I can Jose walking tbh &amp; can‚Äôt blame him if the board is not backing him.

<|startoftext|>@Nadal_LH_Fan It‚Äôs a bit of an embarrassment tbh I can‚Äôt see us adding at all &amp; some of our fans more about worried pointing out Klopps‚Äôs comments on the Pogba deal than our business, I‚Äôd rather our manager having to eat his words &amp; improve the squad instead of the shite summer we are having<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RCoughlan19 @UnitedPeoplesTV Seriously lad it‚Äôs pissing me off, the same fans tryna point this out are the same ones begging United to spend ¬£200mil. Klopp will be happy to eat his words next May if ye have a successful season<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnitedPeoplesTV Seriously so what ? Least they are spending money to challenge I‚Äôd rather be having the summer their having &amp; have to eat my words than the shite summer we are having. Our fans are becoming like fans of so called lesser clubs when they become obsessed with stuff like this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MENCKelly That‚Äôs looks a big if at the moment, like what defenders are they after ? I know they wanted Alderweireld earlier in the summer but it doesn‚Äôt look like they wanna ¬£70mil on him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MENCKelly @utdxtra Yeah but he has now realized that to challenge you need to spend. Seems United‚Äôs financial well has dried up it seems, the only player we‚Äôve signed that will go straight into the first team is Fred but known Mourinho he‚Äôll probably start Fellaini, another painful season ahead üòû<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was hilarious &amp; scary at the same time. How stupid are those people ? üòÇ #WhoIsAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You want to know how dead United‚Äôs summer has been ? We are not getting linked with every name under the sun, there has been the inevitable links to Bale &amp; Ronaldo before he went Juve but other than the links to Sandro &amp; Alderweireld we‚Äôve been linked to nobody #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nadal_LH_Fan We have the cash but do the club wanna give Mourinho anymore ? They gave him ¬£150mil in his first summer ¬£145mil last summer ¬£70mil so far this summer, they‚Äôve given him over ¬£300mil &amp; we haven‚Äôt made much improvement so can‚Äôt really blame the club either<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nadal_LH_Fan club never indicated that there was a change in transfer strategy. We are in for another tough season<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nadal_LH_Fan I know but there was never gonna be more than 3 signings Mourinho said that in January, after the FA Cup final fans made up this thing of there is gonna be a massive clear out &amp; 6/7 players are gonna come in now are upset that it didn‚Äôt happen &amp; now blaming the club when the...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nadal_LH_Fan Our summer business is a lot but done. Remember Mourinho said when we signed Sanchez that we‚Äôd planned sign 4 this summer but since we signed Sanchez we‚Äôs would only sign 3 we have Fred &amp; Dalot we might get one more but that‚Äôs it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely great World Cup gutted that it‚Äôs over, have to wait 4 &amp; half years for the next one üò©üò© #WorldCup #ThankYouRussia2018<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Croatia look like they have no energy left #CRO #ENG #WorldCup<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DanScutt84 @mrmichaelbarton Nah I think we‚Äôll get another CB but these fans that thought we were gonna sell all the deadwood &amp; bring in 6-7 players like City did last year were deluded<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrmichaelbarton Yeah I think Martial is staying as well I also think that we are gonna be in for a long, hard season<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrmichaelbarton No they didn‚Äôt, they have always maintained that there would 3/4 signings max this summer we‚Äôve got two in Fred &amp; Dalot I‚Äôd expect us to get maybe another CB &amp; maybe at a push a backup to Lukaku &amp; Blind &amp; Darmian to leave &amp; that‚Äôll be our business this summer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrmichaelbarton He said that in January before the we got embarrassed by Sevilla &amp;lost in the FAC final.

<|startoftext|>West Ham ain‚Äôt playing around this summer Diop, Wilshere, Fabia≈Ñski &amp; now Yarmolenko + they are in talks to sign Felipe Anderson<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Much needed goal to open up this game #FRA #BEL #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Do your research not all members of the EU are members of NATO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a great first half, Hazard has been the best player of the Park. Interesting second half ahead #FRA #BEL #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great save by Lloris #BEL #FRA #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>of years. So much for clearing the deadwood &amp; spending what ever it takes to catch City, they got even better today by agreeing a deal to sign Mahrez. We‚Äôll be lucky to get top 4 next season #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>United decided not to go after Ronaldo to go after other targets like fucking no one...everything is gone quiet we are not even getting linked with that many players anymore all signs point to a dreadful summer for us.

<|startoftext|>What a strike that is! #RUS #CRO #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good start from Russia #RUS #CRO #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly can‚Äôt believe that Forsberg is valued at ¬£50mil even in today‚Äôs market he is awful #ENG #SWE #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very good save by Pickford #SWE #ENG #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly can‚Äôt see what Sweden can do to get back into this #SWE #ENG #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sweden should have started Martin Olsson cause they have 0 pace anywhere in this team #SWE #ENG #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sweden solid at the back but offering nothing going forward #SWE #ENG #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In saying all that about Brazil &amp; South American football Belgium were excellent I‚Äôd take Hazard over Neymar any day &amp; I‚Äôm so glad Lukaku is at United he has everything can finish, can run in behind defenses, strong in the air &amp; holding up the balk #BRA‚Å† #BEL #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCMOTD Neymar won‚Äôt lace Ronaldo or Messi‚Äôs boots<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>South American football is dead. They‚Äôve been awful at the last 4 World Cups bar Argentina reaching the final in 2014 #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Neymar ¬£200mil üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ won‚Äôt pay ¬£200 for him #BRA #BEL #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has to get that on target at least #BRA #BEL #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should have scored that #BRA #BEL #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a ball from Coutinho! Game on #BRA #BEL #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brazil need to stop tryna go through the center &amp; play from the wide positions if they have any hope of getting back into this #BRA #BEL #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nah Jesus definitely has something on that Brazilian manager how is he still on the pitch ? #BRA #BEL #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Neymar‚Äôs reputation has caught up on him a bit there cause that was foul imo #BRA #BEL #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brazil are so predictable pass it around, give it to Marcelo who crosses it or cuts it back to Neymar or Coutinho #BRA #BEL #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This could be another 7-1 Belgium look devastating on the counter attack #BEL #BRA #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I‚Äôm so glad we have Lukaku he has everything you want in a striker can finish, has strength to hold up the ball  &amp; pace to run in behind defenses #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Kev15178851 @rtenews 1) TD‚Äôs aren‚Äôt impassioned about the Health &amp; Housing crisis because if they were SF &amp; FF would stop bluffing about no confidence in Murphy &amp; Harris &amp; bring no confidence bills forward 2) Not saying the bill isn‚Äôt important but they are always talking about it &amp; getting no where<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rtenews If they got more impassioned about the homeless crisis or the health crisis then maybe we‚Äôd get somewhere or if they‚Äôd got more impassioned about cervical check the country might get actually answers but instead they are fighting over a fucking road traffic bill<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I said earlier in the summer by signing Dalot over an experienced RB like Sidibe we were shopping in poundland &amp; us not being in for Ronaldo (if he‚Äôs leaving) re-affirms that #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Ronaldo is really intent on leaving Madrid (which I still don‚Äôt know believe he is) then why aren‚Äôt United in for him ? It would b really stupid of Ed &amp; Jose if we are not #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ebowtaylor88 @steward1998 @simonjones2019 @piersmorgan @GaryLineker As I said I‚Äôm not criticizing I‚Äôd do the same thing if I was a manager but can‚Äôt say you didn‚Äôt choose this route cause you kinda did<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alikeabledouche @ebowtaylor88 @steward1998 @simonjones2019 @piersmorgan @GaryLineker Yes but if ye wanted to win the game ye wouldn‚Äôt have focused on what Belgium were doing &amp; ye would have played a full strength team<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People watch game on the tv channel it was shown on  https://t.co/hLgu8X2VyX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ebowtaylor88 @steward1998 @simonjones2019 @piersmorgan @GaryLineker I‚Äôm not criticizing here but ye kind of did choose the route by playing a second team against Belgium<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>England were decent to night&amp; deserved to win but can‚Äôt help but think if they come up against a team with a good midfield e.g Croatia they‚Äôd lose cause as much as Lingard, Alli&amp; Henderson give you energy they don‚Äôt have that Modric&amp;Rakitic like football brains #WorldCup‚Å† ‚Å†#ENG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has Harry Kane ever missed a peno? #WorldCup #ENG #COL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>England winning this here #ENG #COL #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did England not research Yerry Mina 2 goals in 3 games from corners at this World Cup #WorldCup #COL #ENG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should been at least 7mins of added time #COL #ENG #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Colombians have lost their heads #COL #ENG #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ref has lost control of the game #ENG #COL #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryLineker Should have been a red but if Neymar went down the way Henderson went down ye would be crucifying him now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Neymar went down as easy as Henderson the English media would be crucifying him now #COL #ENG #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Colombian fella should have been sent off but Jesus Henderson was like Neymar there, he barely touched him #COL #ENG #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That Barrios in midfield for Colombia reads the game so well #COL #ENG #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good start from England #COL #ENG #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come 9:30 I‚Äôll probably be wrong but I think Colombia are beating England tonight #ENG #COL #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Xhaka, Shaqiri &amp; Rodriguez are 3 awful footballers #SUI #SWE #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has to hit the target there #SUI #SWE #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brilliant save by Sommer #SUI #SWE #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>there even a point of the playing the season next year &amp; fans watching cause we all now who is definitely gonna win it. #NBA #NBAFreeAgency<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I find it hard to believe no other team especially the Pelicans considering they traded for him &amp; he has been pretty good for them didn‚Äôt have offer for Boogie. He took an easy way to a ring just like K.D did &amp; ruined the NBA even more in the process. Is...#NBAFreeAgency #NBA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Neither of the All-Ireland Preliminary QF‚Äôs live on T.V this weekend just goes to show that they are just a qualifier with a different name &amp; not this big prize of doing well in the Joe McDonagh Cup that everyone is making them out to be #GAA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheHoopCentral It‚Äôs probably better now cause you‚Äôll probably have Celtics or 76ers winning the east &amp; you won‚Äôt have Cavs-Warriors finals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always said LeBron should have went Philly, two proven young stars in an easier conference but fair play to him for taking on LA challenge, they need to get Kawhi now #Lakers #LeBron<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a fucking save #DEN #CRO #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Expected more after the 5mins especially from Croatia #CRO #DEN #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Croatia should have scored there, Denmark all over the place at the back #CRO #DEN #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man I love this World Cup #CRO #DEN #WorldCup<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@donlon_rory Probably has tbh üòÇüòÇ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@getnickwright Then why did Woj say his reps are meeting with Philly ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Suppose the Spanish media will blame De Gea for that instead of blaming the Pique who actually gave the penalty away #ESP #RUS #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Game on #RUS #ESP #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sportsman002 Probably not but him, LeBron &amp; them kids in LA wouldn‚Äôt have beaten GS either cause it doesn‚Äôt look like LA wants to give up young assets for Kawhi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great backheel that #ESP #RUS #WorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sportsman002 He had $220mil+ reasons to not opt-out &amp; stay in Indiana but he didn‚Äôt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DRAY17 @Yg_Trece He doesn‚Äôt like been the main man on a team that‚Äôs why he was gonna out of Indiana with OKC he isn‚Äôt the main man Russ is so he doesn‚Äôt have that pressure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DRAY17 @Yg_Trece Yeah but if he cares about money more than a ring he would have stayed in Indiana, he knows probably ain‚Äôt gonna win a ring with OKC but he probably also knows he probably ain‚Äôt gonna win one in LA so why uproot &amp; leave a place to get the same results ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DRAY17 @Yg_Trece First it was money now it‚Äôs he doesn‚Äôt wanna ring as the reason he‚Äôs staying in OKC which one is it ? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Maybe it‚Äôs he actually likes OKC &amp; likes playing with Russ + he wasn‚Äôt gonna win a ring with LA whilst KD, Step, Klay &amp; Draymond are with GSW even with LeBron<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DRAY17 @Yg_Trece If he cared about his bank account he wouldn‚Äôt told Indiana he was opting out, he would have stayed there &amp; got the 220mil+ super max deal<|endoftext|>
