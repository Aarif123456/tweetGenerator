<|startoftext|>Men including myself need to work on expressing our feelings. By not learning this lesson we are killing our selves from the inside out. #Mentalhealth #mentaltoughness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jasxnmusic I learned this from  @WontelMusic @prodbypoetics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jasxnmusic People shouldn’t be asking you for free photos. Real artist know what it takes and how much time it takes and what you go through mentally physically to be great. I learned a while ago if I’m asking anybody for a service you will get your money because I value your art .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The reason I’ll pick Kanye over trump is Kanye has always been Kanye. He’s not a public figure and isn’t the president. He’s a rapper, he’s allowed to say utter non sense. The president is always on twitter acting like he’s a rapper and that’s the problem  #KanyeWest #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MADEtoLean I just thought I’d leave my 5 cents<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MitchDarrell_ I talk about basketball and stupid stuff because at the end of the day it really has nothing to do with me it’s just fun but man this other stuff hurts for real<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MitchDarrell_ Lol you feel me. That’s why I don’t even talk about this stuff because people really are ignorant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yiido07 @BigDragon_3 @heelsbasket @MagicHof @AnotherNBAFan It’s the truth. Phil use to let kobe do it and it worked sometimes more so in the playoffs imo Doc rivers gets all this crap but diantoni is way worse and is a regular season coach that doesn’t run an offense 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yiido07 @BigDragon_3 @heelsbasket @MagicHof @AnotherNBAFan Wait real quick what plays do the damn rockets run. They do the get out the way kobe play but these dudes ain’t kobe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heelsbasket @MagicHof @AnotherNBAFan I think something everybody needs is to just talk ball and see everybody side it’s really the only way to enjoy greatness or basketball in general nobody is completely wrong in every case<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zb1003Zachman @MagicHof @AnotherNBAFan But the reasons they do this is cause there is always a lack of consistency on both sides. There’s no way around for both sides there will always be excuses on both sides. People need to see that<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Using the word gay is to much of a norm in society. If something is gay it’s seen as really bad and obviously that’s not the case. Just like being taught to be racist, society teaches homophobia. I was taught to dislike gay people by society<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HonsyyYT @dsevic2 @dawiz88 @TheArmoTrader @LakerFilmRoom I don’t think Kobe and Lebron can be compared if Kobe was as big as bron he’d be better then bron that’s without a doubt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HonsyyYT @dsevic2 @dawiz88 @TheArmoTrader @LakerFilmRoom 2 different eras of ball back when centers were really centers tbh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MillionaireMims @OnBeatMusic Lol so if he doesn’t agree he’s hating. Some people don’t think bron is very good and that’s ok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ERgoNZwasntHERE @OnBeatMusic  https://t.co/pFUEIpH3kw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeechReal @OnBeatMusic I think it is bron himself he’s kinda corny 🤣🤣🤣. Like it’s cringe when this dude talks tbh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OnBeatMusic For Kobe cause it’s the most corny thing in the world to watch these playoffs and to call Lebron James king like he’s their daddy 🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OnBeatMusic Sir I agree to an extent. And remember that people really think bron is the goat lol I’m not sure why but now they gonna wanna fight. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Although he’s playing  a young nuggets team who isn’t quite ready for the lime lite.

<|startoftext|>@NickCooper_7 @NoDay13ut2day @PenguinsFanFL I never said everybody is racist but I call it how I see it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickCooper_7 @NoDay13ut2day @PenguinsFanFL Did you say agreeded ??! I still won’t call it out because that’s not who I am.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickCooper_7 @NoDay13ut2day @PenguinsFanFL You can keep cursing I have no reason to curse at you bro. Do you any black friends ???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickCooper_7 @NoDay13ut2day @PenguinsFanFL So mad at me it’s hilarious. Remember to be tough in real life also.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickCooper_7 @NoDay13ut2day @PenguinsFanFL Look at you cursing at me I’m not your enemy. Earlier you told me that all people have been enslaved. Go ahead and delete it now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickCooper_7 @NoDay13ut2day @PenguinsFanFL I don’t think anybody is out to get me. I voiced what I felt it was and that’s it. I’m not sure who you’ve been talking to but you dismissing slavery of African Americans with everybody has been enslaved is the craziest stuff I’ve heard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watch out for people who ask questions to black people like why you gotta bring race into. Also watch out for words like reverse racism or victim mentality. It’s a way to side step the problem. Never stop talking about these thing ❤️ #goodmorning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickCooper_7 @NoDay13ut2day @PenguinsFanFL Yeah they would love em.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NickCooper_7 @PenguinsFanFL God says tell the truth I’m doing just that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickCooper_7 @PenguinsFanFL You’re dancing around it. Victim mentality is made up by the people running the show. I’ll let you guess what that means<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickCooper_7 @PenguinsFanFL You can call me whatever you want I’ve lived this. I know I’m not wrong it’s pretty simple<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickCooper_7 @PenguinsFanFL He said yaw btw. Do black folk have problems ???<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NickCooper_7 @PenguinsFanFL Look how mad you are. Don’t ever in your life tell a black person not to bring racism into something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickCooper_7 @PenguinsFanFL And now you decided to start cursing at me. I’m not your enemy I’m telling from things I’ve experienced<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickCooper_7 @PenguinsFanFL Black people like me huh ??? You probably think there’s a such thing as reverse racism too huh. You have never been through these things so you really have no leg to stand on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WiHLSilentH Lol ok chill 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickCooper_7 @PenguinsFanFL Now you’re calling me dumb because you have no experience in the area I’m talking about. Hmmm very interesting.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@juko44955216 @BooneGage Idk bout that but I respect it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@prophetokounmpo He’s takes on 4 defenders then gets mad when he doesn’t get a call. The raptors baited him last yr during the finals. See what happened right ?? He didn’t get any calls because the first couple rounds of the playoffs are easy compared to the last rounds. They let those boys play<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gcp2000 @SnottieDrippen I truly don’t think he is. Sure he’ll go to the hall n all that but they aren’t winning anything on that bucks team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juko44955216 @BooneGage I agree wit that but I’m tired of the mike Jordan blasphemy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gcp2000 @SnottieDrippen Bro you didn’t Kevin any credit. It’s how you said it. You can say whatever you want Giannis is dope be he will never get out that East. And even when he does they are still missing a piece. He won’t win a chip on the bucks they just aren’t ready yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody need to come get they mans  https://t.co/snW5zsYCiH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t mess with Giannis fans no more. Really bias it’s crazy bruhh. Btw Giannis is never getting out that East it’s just the truth  #Milwaukee #Bucks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gcp2000 @SnottieDrippen I mean that’s ur opinion giannis hasn’t been in the league for very long. You gave no credit to KD it’s cool though 2 rings on that finger. N giannis is never coming out that East just saying. He’ll leave in frustration they’re missing one more key piece<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juko44955216 @BooneGage I mean I feel players were a lol tougher but not as athletic<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BenFran24166903 @jncochran0069 @spitlahhhh @BradleyJa1997 @Kaepernick7 @Nike I’m proud of some parts of the country but for me to sit here like America is just plain old great all the time I will not lie like that. Things need to change. And I’m not going anywhere I’m going to be part of change starting with my own people.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BenFran24166903 @jncochran0069 @spitlahhhh @BradleyJa1997 @Kaepernick7 @Nike Black people were inslaved in the past. So America in itself would’ve had to be great first for it to be supposedly great again. So you can block me or I’ll just block you. Make a decision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenFran24166903 @jncochran0069 @spitlahhhh @BradleyJa1997 @Kaepernick7 @Nike N your profile says maga. So as a black man in this country do you really think I would listen to anything you have to say ? I’m pretty nuetral on kap tbh but statements like make America great again would insinuate that this country was ran right in the past.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@weneedlesslaws @jncochran0069 @spitlahhhh @BradleyJa1997 @Kaepernick7 Man he’s not anti cop but this country doesn’t hold police officers accountable. You give a scared person a gun he’s going to shoot first ask questions later let’s talk bout it<|endoftext|>

Bell sat out a yr watch what he does next yr. He’s going to kill, we know that. I really don’t have any expectations for Barkley. Zeke we already know he’s going to kill it because he has every yr even when he’s been suspended.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LangeCollin @TerminiAnthony @Grant__Jones @CHIEFSNEWS816 @LemurKnows @Jeepwitbeat @johnny_boy1246 @ajk23az @WerderEdESPN @AdamSchefter For one yr there no argument. So quick to take away from zeke n give to a second yr player. Is it because he plays for the cowboys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grant__Jones @CHIEFSNEWS816 @Craigo713 @TerminiAnthony @LemurKnows @Jeepwitbeat @johnny_boy1246 @ajk23az @WerderEdESPN @AdamSchefter I don’t feel Barkley has done enough.

<|startoftext|>@ajk23az @WerderEdESPN @AdamSchefter I mean I’m a cowboys fan n I think their good at different things. It’s close though. Isn’t bell older also ???<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@god2365 @gifdsports N he will be in the hall of game one day soon but that’s my ted talk. But not better then wade though. The real question is how good would these players be if they were in the western conference ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@god2365 @gifdsports He did stay with the Celtics for a long ass time. He deserves more respect then he gets. I think this is his reasoning for saying this.

<|startoftext|>@tia_o0o Popularity of music genres does matter also<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tia_o0o Lol major record labels have co-signs though that’s not opinion.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tia_o0o I disagree people have never understood rap. I don’t think money is a good indicator there are a lot of rappers who are trash who sell millions of records<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MrDrewLandry @KodeRedMusic N cheese don’t forget white folk love cheese 🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For people who think success is having a lot of money you will end up very lonely n depressed #MoneyCalling #DepressionIsReal #idols #Evil #Wisdom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Addicts need to be loved on equally as much as rebuked. If you aren’t willing to help but have no problem hurting the person or people, just leave now hard work is needed abandonment only pushes the addict farther from recovery #love #addictionrecovery #God<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Tyren4President @Jamario44 You following the Lebron to every team logic.

He’s a better all around player but also gets sorry players on his teams on purpose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cleveland this is for youuuuu 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😆😆😆😁😁😁😁  #LeBronToLA #hilarious #Lakers4Life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tyren4President @Jamario44 You are a Lebron follower you went on the internet n read some stats n I don’t know what I’m talking bout, I’ve forgotten more basketball than you know soooo yeah. Yaw follow bron like he’s Jesus.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Tyren4President Lol I like how you danced around what I said Kobe was a hard shot maker. Lebron charges to the basket and gets layups of course he has better stats better shots better stats. You told me brons worst season is better than Kobe’s best season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tyren4President Lebron took easier shots has a lot of weight on Kobe n passes the ball for the last shot (n he came to la because Cleveland is trash) if that’s the case steph is just as good as bron they both have 3 rings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You Lebron Stan’s think he’s coming to la to run things it’s not going to happen like that, this ain’t Cleveland 🤡  #LakersSummer #clowns #LeBronToLA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tyren4President Lol well technically 🤣🤣🤣 bad thing bout these bron followers is yaw  follow em everywhere, n that’s an opinion<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheRealSaigon @9thwonder @blackthought No lies detected 🧐 I’ll keep searching so cats don’t think I’m biased 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Cavs too worried bout Draymond and the refs, they ain’t winning nothing this year. I guess that stuff is a success because green is all yaw talking about (your going home and I can’t wait)  #DraymondGreen #Refs #SaturdayMorning #Homeland #Kinging #lame<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kade_lynch @joey_fulghum @Joel_Trevino89 @espn Soooo wait does bron have to like his gm for them to do well ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Skarekro36 @sirflexalot111 @jalenramsey 🤣🤣🤣🤣 naw it’s cool I mean I’m not in the nba so I’d make up my own nick name lol I mean I did 🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_AsvpGod @AnUgIyNigga @goodmiad We 🧐 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 ye will always be raw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RuslanKD @zachsperrazzo @Jettrouble @jon_keith_ @WHATUPRG @joeyvantes @thederekminor Hey how do you think @rayshonmusic did as the opener just wondering because that’s the homie 🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Skarekro36 @sirflexalot111 @jalenramsey Nooo lol I was talking bout Lebron I don’t know u I wouldnt talk bout ur nick name 🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man these dudes think that my Mans Chan Diggy aka @prodbypoetics is playing get wit it or get lost  https://t.co/P1VuS4gyUU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@livrey703 I’m to flyyy for that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Skarekro36 @sirflexalot111 @jalenramsey So either way if bron goes home he’s the greatest but if he wins it all he’s the greatest also 🧐 explain how that works please I’m just trying to make sense of this logic he either has a good team or he doesn’t pick one because he’s going home<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Skarekro36 @sirflexalot111 @jalenramsey Lol that’s funny he called me sway(read between the lines) and you called him king like he pays yo bills plus I don’t trust anybody who makes up they own nick names (bron has that team because he wants it)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mineifiwildout Haters bro chill and stop using other people lyrics 🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kade_lynch @joey_fulghum @Joel_Trevino89 @espn If Lebron wanted to win he would’ve got better players and not sorry ones so he could do everything. He’s Russ Westbrook but better but just as selfish on the ball court<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kay_BlackSimba @Blow0sDodgeHOES I still mess wit ye on all levels<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yo vocabulary is trash if you get mad and the first thing that comes out yo mouf  is a curse word (let it marinade my G) #goodafternoon #LanguageEducation #trash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RockstarJt @RockstarJt what is a best did you mean to say something else 🧐 base maybe I’m trying to understand 🤣🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sirflexalot111 @jalenramsey Idk man I would never want to play for bron or Westbrook I just don’t see it going anywhere especially if your as good as kyrie is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sirflexalot111 @jalenramsey No Russell Westbrook is a selfish player he takes bad shots and only cares about himself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sirflexalot111 @jalenramsey I believe kyrie wanted out because bron is selfish and the offense runs through him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sirflexalot111 @jalenramsey I don’t believe that they don’t want to play lebron dude is suspect and is a stat padder he has more of a say then you think<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@b00lincoach @03Javi03 @NoChiIlMario @BleacherReport Nobody wants to play with bron that’s the truth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@b00lincoach @03Javi03 @NoChiIlMario @BleacherReport No he wants the offense to run through him, that’s why kyrie left and nobody wants to play with bron. He selects mediocre team mates because he wants to look like the man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoChiIlMario @BleacherReport Bron has lost sooo much n he’s in the east I’m not a Jordan fan at all but there’s a reason why bron has no help it’s because nobody wants to play with him. The offense runs through him that’s why kyrie left. Do you really think he can’t get a superstar on his team 🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jalenramsey @sirflexalot111 They have a whole team the reason bron doesn’t have help is he don’t want help. He pushed kyrie out the door the same way Russ pushed Durant out the door. Do you really think that he can’t get another superstar on that team ? Dude wants a bunch of no names. That’s the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SowmyaK No Kanye no cudi this is blasphemy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlesFrancess @JamesMolina31 @goat_jis @Rachel__Nichols Sooo wait there not allowed to review even though they got the right call out of it 🧐<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fribone @queyabish00 the boy is not that good I swear yaw act like he invented rap, he made a song where he repeated gods plan50 times n everyone was oh like that boy but hasn’t really rapped in a long time I mean he ain’t kendrick or Cole forget pusha I just don’t get the hype anymore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UglyBlackBoii Wait and your hyping dude drake up like he’s Nas when dude is lowkey an industry puppet and he try’s to be this fake tough guy soooooo......and anyone who sings shouldn’t act tough or at least in my opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lol drake fans are interesting in the generation where you think you know hip hop cause you know old drake songs. Do your research I’m not saying clips is better then drake but they did pave the way  #Drake #lame #History<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fribone @queyabish00 To me that dude drake had turned into an industry puppet, I compare em to Bieber<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fribone @queyabish00 Lol I think pusha is a better rapper then drake better subject matter, actually has something to talk about more authentic doesn’t sing, is actually been through what he’s rapping album sales don’t mean nothing especially when drake fans are mostly women n think he looks good<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@emilyychang_ Does time have to pass for it to be a classic ? I’m just saying look at the songs, albums, artists they had to go through hell to be considered classic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If your charging full speed on offense in basketball don’t get mad if I foul you.  #foul #basketball #hilarious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Coachella is 450 bucks. That’s a home studio to record music. If you went to Coachella but won’t pay for a dope mix n master then that’s on you. A Michael Jackson Bad tour concert ticket cost around that price.  #weak #GoodMorningWorld #WOW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A Classic is hard to come by. Stop calling stuff classic unless you have facts that it is a classic. For example anything Michael Jackson touched was a classic, Illmatic by Nas another classic, Tribe Called Quest classic  #classic #Real<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyychang_ I mean it’s dope but a modern classic 🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mcmanny65 @F0UR_3Y3S @DJmKnight12 @giaawoman Lol it has nothing to do with drug testing Donald punk should be the one being tested.
