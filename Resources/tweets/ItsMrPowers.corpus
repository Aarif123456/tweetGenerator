<|startoftext|>@NPR By the way... Last I checked NPR was state funded media.  I think that's called propaganda?  And how interesting that they want to make you hate capitalism and America, all by preying on your worst human qualities (greed, envy, anger.). Don't be deceived!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NPR Lol just wanted to hop in here to have a chuckle at all the bitching, moaning, and envy at a world that is better than it's ever been EVER.  Wasn't let down.  GET TO WORK PEOPLE!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NPR Lol you guys sold out on the Trump hate bandwagon.  Along with many others. I used to listen to NPR regularly.  Objective journalism has all but been thrown out the window.  Follow @Timcast or @EpochTimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BooherEarl @SarahKSilverman I'll take destroying ISIS(there's your bigger deficit...

And I'm a registered Democrat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahKSilverman 4 years of Trump and 2 supreme Court nominees and people can still get abortions.  Idk just seems like it would've already been banned by now.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom People really need to look deeper into climate change than what news media has told you.
