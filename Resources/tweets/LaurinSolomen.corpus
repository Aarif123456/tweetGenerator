<|startoftext|>Beshear knows he is promoting fear that unnecessarily. He needs to keep the state closed down to try to curtail VOTING. Beshear is a control freak. He is a one-time gov, for sure. He owes his election to teachers and teachers only. That won't happen, again.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ice83Matty @kyoag I'd like to see your data.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill #CDC is #WfauxExpertFauci's own organization! #Fauci is a #globalist and cannot be trusted. He doesn't ever tell the same story twice. Stop quoting the #littleRodent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill .   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Fauci's organization) issued an update Friday noting that the death rates from pneumonia, influenza and COVID-19 have DROPPED for 10 STRAIGHT WEEKS, from 9.0% in week 25 to 5.9% in week 26. No more epidemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NastyNancy hopes to sneak in as a #DementiaJoe #replacement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did you know PNEUMONIA and FLU deaths are combined with COVID 19 deaths? Indeed, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Fauci's organization) issued an update Friday noting that the death rates from pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 have DROPPED for 10 STRAIGHT WEEKS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, #beshear positive tests do NOT translate to #cases. If you don't understand the testing and the science #shutUp with your attempts to panic people. #MoreTests + #Morepositives NOT CASES.  Did you know PNEUMONIA and FLU deaths are combined with COVID 19 deaths?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ericcrawford Who does the #littleEmperor believe to be stupid? #MoreTesting = #MorePositiveResults NOT MORE CASES. Get it right and stop politicizing the #chinaVirus. Even the common cold can produce a positive.  https://t.co/zXB9yFey7T<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ericcrawford Wear them. Let Andy wear them. Just wondering why? As of yesterday, there were 623 deaths from the #ChinaVirus in Ky.'s population of a few thousand more than 4.4M residents. That is: 623 is 0.0141590909% of 4,400,000. #explainAndy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's because #andy wants to be Ky.'s #dictator. #andy wants to #rule. #CameronIsRight. 623 deaths from #chineseVirus in Ky.'s population of 4.4M+ That figures to: 623 is 0.0141590909% of 4,400,000 #explainAndy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KaseyGurley @kyoag Hardly irresponsible. Cameron is not panic-stricken.   #andy is using the #chinese virus for political reasons. #Andy wants to be a #dictator.  #andy is a one-term gov. 623 deaths in Ky. a population of 4.4M+ citizens in Ky. 623 is 0.0141590909% of 4,400,000 #explainAndy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What will that enforcement entail? Jail? Fines? Stand in the corner? #Andy is a one-term Gov. #Andy wants to be a #dictator. 623 deaths in Ky. 4.4 M+ people in Ky. 623 is 0.0141590909% of 4,400,000 #ExplainAndy<|endoftext|>
