<|startoftext|>IF that's possible, why not? Exactly what does "not seating" them mean? Temporarily? Conditions? The thing is if it's truly possible, I can't see Dems doing it. BTW, would that mean Ds would have majority if they don't seat them?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Without a doubt,#Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha!   Yup!  That sums it up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought I read #DougJones was AG pick. #Rachel reporting several choices, including #Yates. I must have misunderstood.  I thought #Biden already made the choice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone think that #Trumps plan all along was that this would go to SCOTUS, only HE expected his appointees would be obliged to side with him? Crazy I know, but so Trumpian.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I sure hope we can count on her. She doesn’t appear to be someone who will cave. 🤞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s amazing that other countries give monthly payments. The supposed richest country in the world throws bread crumbs once 4 months ago. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly!!! That’s what it would be!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really? They actually demanded immunity? Hell no, they shouldn’t agree. Add bribery to their charges. That being said, I too am not sure Dems have the guts. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, what’s left? I mean there is no place else to go, how long are they gonna milk this?🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GOOD!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I heard #Trump wanted $600 stimulus payments. They have money for an indoor tennis court at the WH tho. Wonder where the $ is coming from 🙄#MoscowMitch is insisting on lawsuit protection. I wonder why? What’s init for him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DougJones  I don't dislike him, but I really was hoping for #Yates  I hope he's aggressive enough for the hjob.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's weird. John Wilkes Booth, another<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Totally would not surprise me. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There had to have been some benefit to #Trump, either some kind of ego booster to himself or financial gain?? He thought declining would make him look good? (I know, how can he look good, but with Trump who knows)🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is o e of those stories that imo is huge and I’m surprised it’s not the headliner it should be. Our leader declined a vaccine for a pandemic killing millions of ppl. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, I'm thinking (hoping) that it's one of those cases that SCOTUS declines to hear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait, they are going to #SCOTUS.  Didn't we know somehow, it'd get that far? Hopefully we can trust SCOTUS to follow the law, tho who knows? I don't have total trust in them. They'd have to move pretty fast on a decision tho, no?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fine by me. Hopefully he’ll lay low til Jan 20. (I know.....not likely) 🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Perhaps that’s why he’ll block investigations.......the truth will come out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the hell?  And this is legal? How can he even seriously say that? So now what?  Dems will say ok then we won’t investigate?😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope so. We’ll see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this legal?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheBeat. Who is the guy that’s defending not investigating/prosecuting Trump? And why isn’t already letting the other guy replied to his long answer as to why it would not be worth it? 😡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wtf? 😳 what planet is she from? 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mitch McConnell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By all indications and from what I’ve read direct payments is NOT on the table. It looks like the deal does NOT care about that. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly!  Watch, Ds will cave to Rs banning right to sue and yet omit stimulus payments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I haven’t heard mentioned any talk of direct stimulus payments.  Please don’t cave to the greedy, selfish uncaring Republicans. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That would be a great finale. What’s that #HarrisonFord line from #AirForceOne?  “Get off my plane.” 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly!  Can you imagine how this will go down in history? Not only will #Trump look bad, but ppl will question WHY he was allowed to finish his term.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is anyone surprised?   https://t.co/dxIxTX6JLG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would definitely want someone who WOULD go after #Trump Crimes. I like #Yates and #Schiff but not sure how aggressive they’d be in going after 45 crimes. 🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan So who caved more? Rs wanted at least temporary protection against lawsuits. Last I knew Dems caved to that.  Is it still in package?  Lots of ppl will be pissed with no stimulus check. 😡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Re: #TrumpPardon  IF there is doubt as to whether a President can pardon himself, shouldn’t SCOTUS make the call NOW? Or, will it be #Trump gets away with it, but NO President after will? 🤔OR is that power definitely his?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As I understand, it’s NOT a matter of defunding but rather apply money fo extra training for cops how to handle certain situations, or to put it bluntly, so they aren’t so trigger happy with ppl of color especially. I think the right likes the label, to me it’s misleading.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I seriously have my doubts as well. I don’t plan to take it either....at least not for a while. How the hell can we feel secure when DTs been showing his obvious rush to get a vaccine..at anycost just to make himself look good (as if that’s possible)🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Math for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do. I would not get the vaccine if it’s available,at least not right away. Yes, I have my doubts. I don’t trust any drug approved/released so quickly under this administration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ThankGod! 🙏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Then, mail in ballots it is. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IF that is true, and being a senior with SS a major issue, I would not back her. Damn, and from what I saw of her I liked her..for this she’d lose my support. Btw, wtf calling it entitlement. Sounds so Republican. I paid into SD my entire working life 😡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>One of my all time favorites. Great lyrics. “They stab it with their steely knives but they just can’t kill the beast.” Love guitar at the end. 😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. That would mean that employers (like in the meat plant) who knowingly force workers to work w/out protection etc can’t be sued?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow! Now THAT’S a close election. 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Respectfully, what are you and Dems going to do about it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’d be ok with that but don’t ask Scarf Lady.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boy, that’s the truth! 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree with you but I refuse to get my hopes up. I just have doubts that anything will happen. Dems will have a “let’s move on/work together “strategy which will suit the Rs just fine..except for the work together part of course. 🙁<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ha ha!!!😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How cool! 😎👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There’s absolutely nothing wrong with that picture. What a beautiful family. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg me too. In the same day I’ll get “we’re packing our bags” indicating bad polls/not enough money. Then I get another saying “we’re jumping with joy cause we’re ahead, can you donate 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Why shouldn’t they hold hands if they want to?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha ha ha 😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If anybody here is on the parley site, I suggest they encourage Trump followers to do just that. That’ll show the Dems. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually, I say go ahead and do it. Number of Trump supporters put in his name I say fine by me. 😉😆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. I probably will wait.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In a way it’s nice not hearing his rants.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree. I think they totally lack empathy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a bunch of crooked a** criminals  How can they even consider this? It’s so blatantly wrong.  😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woo hoo@! 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh good!  I hope Dems follow thru if she does NOT comply.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So glad to hear it. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ll never forget that image. 😥<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well,that oughta be good. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would it be cheating if I said Republicans? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope this is true, and if I understand first responders and others are going to be the first to get it. That being said, I can’t see myself willingly getting any vaccine while #Trump is in charge. I don’t trust him/his klan Everybody kisses his a**and I fear it’s  real HOAX.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JFKassassination “Mankind must put an end to war before war puts an end to mankind. War will exist until that distant day when conscientious objector enjoys the same reputation prestige as a warrior does today.” #JFK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JFKassassination   #JFK was assassinated on Friday which of course was the major shock, but thinking back, two days later  #Oswald was shot on live tv is unbelievably amazing. 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow!  I remember that seen so well. It was so shocking that even the media was choked up. 😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JFKassassination Like 911, those of us who lived through this remember exactly where we were, what we were doing and how we found out. It was unthinkable that in our country our president could be  https://t.co/JoOMJzSelc shocking!! RIP #JFK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JFKassassination  It’s hard to believe it’s been 57 years. I remember that day and that weekend so well. I loved JFK. At a young age he’s the one that got me interested in politics. I loved his personality, sense of humor, and outright caring for the country RIP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hell no!!! 😡That’s saying that the President IS above the law. We have never had such a reckless, inept, moronic, law breaking, Ethics breaking president ever. If he’s guilty of crimes, hell yea he should pay. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would not surprise me if he did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, he is very classy. Oh, and #SenatorWarnock does sound nice. I’m rooting for him. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For God sake, can’t anyone pull the plug on this bullsh*t?  😡We know what they’re doing. How can this be ok?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😥😥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Things would not have gotten this far IF the GOP cared. They have proven they are willing to go off the cliff to stand by their man. 😡To hell with democracy and their country 😡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>LOSER AGAIN!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good!!!!👍👌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't get it. Instead of certifying, they want to choose  electors who appoint #Trump? On what basis, other than to cheat in order to win the State? What is their reasoning? Isn't this election tampering at it's worst?? WTAF 🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They have to wait til he leaves to even begin investigating? 🙄I’ll believe it when I see it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess we are sort of on a roller coaster ride, and not a very fun one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg 😳 Are you kidding me? 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh that’s right. Tomorrow will be 57 yrs since #JFKassassination. For me, a day/era that stays vivid in my mind. 😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Then again, if #Trump were to step down NOW, we know #Pence would pardon him. I remember when #Ford pardoned #Nixon, that didn’t go over well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perhaps now would be a good time for #Pelosi to use be of those many arrows she says are in her quiver. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope I am wrong. Hard to imagine ALL his crimes could be forgiven, but who knows?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MSNBC According to #TheMooch, he thinks DT is gonna ask for full pardon of his crimes (both state and Federal)as a bargaining tool. 45 sees what’s coming. I fear that’s what will happen. 😡The “let’s move on” mentality will prevail. 😠<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I understand the confusion but being born/raised in MI, it comes easy   😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha!!! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And, as I understand, Rudy’s getting $20,000 a day? He can’t say he didn’t know what he would be getting. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My thoughts too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They’re all good but I hope he goes with #SallyYates. Btw, not that I’m disappointed she’s VP, but I always thought #Harris would be great as AG.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hell no!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s great but can a judge override the DOJ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh yea, and they’re so reliable. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, is #Trumps goal to end up with #SCOTUS deciding the election? Is that where he’ll go when all else fails?  AND, how much faith do you have in SCOTUS? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha!  😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I sure hope so  Mueller prosecutor explains why Biden will be forced to indict Trump whether he wants to or not -  https://t.co/FeGMMDiSdT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can’t believe how he’s getting away with this. Wouldn’t you think this is blatantly unethical if not totally illegal? 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Regular hair dye wouldn’t do that. My guess is some kind of spray the roots type die. How embarrassing 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC WTF How the hell can he say that? What reason did he give to not count the votes?  😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maddenifico I totally agree. It’s ALWAYS about #Trump and he’s punshing the American ppl because he lost 😡I fear the damage to come in the 2 months he has left in office.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually no. An example I heard earlier was the employers in the meat plants who forced workers to work without protection from CoVid. Hell no. Why Rs want to not have this protection is beyond me. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any names floating around?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree, but we seldom if ever see it. I don’t know what they wait for, sit back and do nothing and hope things go their way?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I Agree.  Enough being timid and patient. Dems are really good at that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bullsh*t!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump asked to meet with MI canvassers about vote count. How is this NOT election tampering?  Oh, I know...it’s a Republican, he can do as he pleases. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s what I thought. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this not illegal? Why the hell cant #Trump ever be held accountable?  Because he was impeached once, and because we are near the end of his term, makes every illegal/unethical thing he does ok? What a crock of sh*t. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which lawmakers did he request?  Republican lapdogs I presume?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, ain’t that the truth. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mueller prosecutor explains why Biden will be forced to indict Trump whether he wants to or not -  https://t.co/FeGMMDiSdT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg! 😳 Do they want to stall #Bidens win?  Isn’t certification of election soon? WTF is their goal? If only Dems would  make immediate demands to investigate #Trump, #Graham and all the crooked Rs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Didn’t they just get back from recess?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No I didn’t didn’t. A big plus for him!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you kidding me?? At what point do these ppl realize how ridiculous they are? 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can’t get much sterner with “extraordinarily discouraged.”  Something like #Collins being very concerned. 🙄I don’t expect much more from Dems I’m sorry to say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Planning his revenge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wtf. 😳Then why not do that???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow!  How forceful. 🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It doesn’t make it so.  More and more Rs are sounding either willfully defiant or just plain stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillPascrell Thank you. I pray others follow in your footsteps and make same demand. 👍Keep pushing for it. 🤞🙏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There’s his Presidential Portrait. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wasn’t aware he could do anything about it. If it’s a slam dunk then yes, WHY? 🙄🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One brave Dem.  Donald Trump accused of ‘innumerable crimes against the United States’: Congressman demands investigation  https://t.co/vmfsvcogzS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yea, finally a Democrat who speaks out. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate to see that happen, but I think it’ll disappear as well 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today. I always wear one when I go outside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do but still waiting for Dems to say it.  Haven’t heard a peep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>MI SOS on #Rachel now talking about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@merrittcoach @WalshFreedom Hey WCP I hear Michigan just now certified the election. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennaEllisEsq @RudyGiuliani 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AND doesn’t it tick you off that Dems say nothing of #LindseyGrahams election tampering in GA?  😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m with you Reda. I wish we’d get some kind signal that gives us hope that they’ll actually get bold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree and hope that’s the case, but call me skeptical. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just read tweet from MI SOS who said she’s not concerned at all.  It will be certified.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The left has a,ways hated Thanksgiving?  Talking out his a**. Typical Republican. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey but Rudy’s  getting $20,000 a day right?  😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha.  Man, i’d love to hear it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No I’m not surprised but I am so disappointed in the Democrats for not speaking up about this strongly, if at all. 😡It’s been a day now and if they haven’t commented by now they want to let it slide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, at what point does an investigation start? Nevada SecState denies talking to Lindsey Graham as election interference scandal expands  https://t.co/Vtf6wT5IzL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We don’t know yet who the attorney general will be correct? However no matter who it is, doesn’t the president have authority to tell them not to investigate?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmandiOnAir I just heard this as well on MSNBC, and I must admit I’m not surprised. I am so disappointed because IS such a major issue. I can’t believe it would just be disregarded but I fear that is what will happen. Democrats don’t have the spine. Surely they can have it investigated. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 @PinchandScrimp So he needs get his ass out of Congress and resign and/or Suspension until investigation has been made. I hear nobody calling for it except for us on Twitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What I want to know is where the hell are the Democrats demanding an investigation ? Nothing is going to happen if they don’t even seem concerned. This is resignation material. Democrats have resigned for much less.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow!  Check my mouthwash and it does have that ingredient. I wonder if that helps.🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#LindseyGraham  I'm just curious as I'm just starting out this morning....has ANY Democrat spoken on this Graham story? I've not seen any.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course you don't. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IF he truly leaves it up to the DOJ. Sorry, but I don’t think it’ll happen. I hope I am wrong tho. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Republicans sound alarm on Georgia Senate runoffs as they privately weigh Trump’s influence  https://t.co/YgudeZssk1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And Rs are looking for election fraud hu?  Look in Your own backyards a-holes. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kind of makes you wonder now doesn’t it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of that’s what we need to do yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@awelab1956 @renato_mariotti Of course if he talked someone into tossing out some ballots in his state, a recount might be too late.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#LindseyGraham I am not seeing any comments by any of our Democrats in Congress. No out rage, no concern? I wish they speak out soon or this was just fade away. We need them to speak out. We know what would happen if the shoe was on the other foot...resignation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#LindseyGrahamResign Guest just now on #Rachel (Ali sitting in) made good point saying #Barr looking all over to investigate election fraud....well, here you Bill, start Investigating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha!!😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@esjay_oh @stevethefirst @RawStory Remember how he was begging for donations toward the end?  He was freaking out and afraid of losing. Knowing he won after hearing about this trick? Smells fishy to me. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ResignLindsey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yea but he already looked like a loser. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A recount of #Graham’s senate seat for sure. How do we know he didn’t have votes thrown out there?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m with you Olga.   Sure hope this is looked into NOW!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree but I fear Dems will be too soft. They should come out swinging NOW.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha. They likely know he doesn’t pay his debts. 😂If it comes out of his own money he won’t do it. He knows he lost. Loser!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh yea, #Trump’s theme song. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#LindseyGraham  Do you think any major Dem will speak on this tonight showing some sense of outrage? I’m not sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmyEGardner Does make me wonder if perhaps SC should have recount?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmyEGardner If true, #Graham needs to step down. Dems stepped down for way less than this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislhayes #Inners top story today. Thanks #ChrisHayes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@educated_educ8r Yes, it’s not a freedom of speech thing it’s a precaution from killing people are getting yourself sick and dying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m sure a #Graham Will deny it. As I understand the Secretary of State there is a Republican right? He can’t pull the Democrats are after me card<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks Barbara<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you gonna cover this story Chris?  So far only WP has it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ryanjreilly @KatCapps What I want to know is why it’s not being reported? IF true,I’d call that breaking news. If not true, SOS needs to say so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@npbat Yea, it’s possible it could be a bogus article but after reading it, I think SOS should confirm or deny. They are serious accusations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmyEGardner SOS said he “was stunned that #Graham suggested he find a way to toss legally cast ballots.” 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m beginning to think they’d be dumb enough to do it. 🙄But, yea, I say go for it. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/VKmRWTVoti<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I googled the SOS name and same WP story came up only I. It’s entirety.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Keep RTing. We want answers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn right it should be investigated. 😡If this is true, Graham should be out of his job and dismissed.  Is this just breaking I am not hearing it anywhere?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh for sure.  My hope is she runs after #Biden serve one term.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree. I have not even seen any democrat on TV strongly reprimanding Trump for doing this. It’s always the low-key BS. If it were reversed, can you imagine the Republicans would be right on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂 I didn’t know who it was but I thought it looked like somebody with a wig.  lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish they’d use the 25Th but sadly, unless Rs are on board, it won’t happen. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully there in GA Dems will spread the word of #Perdue’s cowardice between now and the runoff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As we all should know by now, #Trump will do whatever is best for Trump, period. He cares about nothing else. So, yes, he will get rid of anything incriminating him. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow!  Is this vengeance or what?  https://t.co/6HloyeKLso<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The answer to this should be so obvious, but I imagine, should he try to pardon himself, it’ll go through different channels of investigations and judicial procedures to see if it’s legal. What bullsh*t. Argument will be he has the power to pardon.🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, but isn’t it correct that in the case of a tie vote, VP (#Harris) would be the tie breaker?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds encouraging coming from her, BUT I certainly wouldn’t get my hopes up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Die Hard. In recent years I found out it was considered a Christmas movie. Who knew? LOL still, it is one of my favorite movies. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree with you there Senator. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Warren would be great. Don’t kiss up to GOP. What? Like they’ve been so cooperative with Dems?  Hell no!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan So did the police shoot anybody?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What I meant to say is the protesters are fighting with the police and not with counter protesters correct?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ll bet he does pardon himself. I really have very little faith that anybody would intervene. Rs won’t want to tarnish their party, and Dems will wanna move on aka won’t have the nerve. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You are correct, he is still a huge loser. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha. Well I never thought of it that way,but yeah, sounds totally like him. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOSER<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s his whole life. He thrives on adoration. Again, it’s all about HIM. It is pathetic. 🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I agree. Ppl are getting desperate.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Oh yea, that’s really mo I got forward. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s true. He can’t stand being a loser and is in hiding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChathamScottS @BeschlossDC Scott, I was 12 when #JFK ran and 15 when he was assassinated. That day stays vivid in my mind. Being only in 3rd grade he must have inspired you even at that young age. He was that kind of person. 👍Hang onto that letter. It’s historic. 👍<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ha ha. So true!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good!  Why would they stop?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amen. They don’t see an out and want to”look good.”  They don’t. They are playing CYA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CNN “Aides are split as to whether #Trump may try to pardon himself.” So, that’s what this is all about, his guilt. How can the guilty party themselves? That’s why he’s so defiant. He does not want to go to jail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very nice! 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha!  I think we will manage to get by without them. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, and we supposedly have “fair” elections? How is that fair?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Second place votes as in he came in 2nd place? Is that what he’s saying?  😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tho I haven’t had one in decades, I know how. They’re kind of fun but can’t see buying one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He’s just now coming up with this? 🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can that be legal or ethical? That’s awful.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey, as long as he leaves, that’ll work for me. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been there. I know the feeling. Hang in there. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, I heard a poll showed 80% of all Americans believe #Biden won and wondered if this would affect interest in these rallies. Evidently it does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why midnight??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly I had 2nd thought if he did resign that would be why. Tho, he can’t be pardoned for any SDNY crimes as I understand it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where did you read that? It would be great, but doubt it’s true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not. Even IF there was a miscount, it would be slight and not enough to make a difference. Btw, what IF the recount ended up giving even MORE votes to #Biden? That'd be a kick in the pants for Rs wouldn't it? 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Even IF #Trump ended up with GA (he won’t), he’d still lose election. Talk about desperation. 🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Then what the hell is he doing there? 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It would not surprise me. I don’t trust either #Graham or #MoscowMitch. They both won by fairly sizable margins.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wow!  It had to be that number that number?😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you kidding me? It’s so close they need a run off, so it’s rigged? Talk about a bunch of whiny ass sore losers? 😡🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s for sure. Makes you wonder what side the ,supposed fair/balanced, press is on. 🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To think that #Biden is nice enough and has indicated he will work together with the Republicans is not very reassuring. Working with THIS group of Republicans means giving in to everything the Republicans want. That pisses me off. One side alone should not be the one to cave<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I am wondering if both of them have Covid and are in seclusion somewhere. We know #Trump would not want anybody to know if his major staff came down with it. We also know that his whole crooked team would help keep the secret.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am so happy to hear that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know many say he won’t leave and perhaps not, but I also heard some speculate he will leave early and #Pence takes over for two months. He’s humiliated and I wouldn’t put that past him either. Also #Pence could pardon him before he left. Remember it’s ALWAYS about him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope so. 🤞It’s so great having a normal President again and definitely worth celebrating BUT not only a woman VP but a woman of color. Yea! In my lifetime. “I am woman hear me roar.”😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wasn’t he at one time the Republicans golden boy? What happened?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And Republican lapdogs can make up election stories aka lies, go to court and sue all they want. Just because they do so, doesn’t make  any of it true. Go for it. Truth wins in the end. 👍<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DrEricDing @WHO So happy to hear that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GenMhayden I think he does no? I assume at least NOW he should start getting briefings.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ppl made such a big deal about “What if” Trump didn’t leave. It’s that easy as you said. Pick up his ass and remove him. I sense from today on, ppl will care less and less what he says or does. He’s history, thankfully. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love it!! ❤️👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I heard recently that #Biden was considering him for a cabinet position. You know....reaching out. That’s always worked so well for Dems. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Kasick also said that #Biden had to make sure to listen to the other side. Right, just like Rs alwayslistened to Dems. 🙄Plus, you can’t ignore progressives as #MoscowMitch suggested Ds do in order to work with Rs. That’s BS. Ds always do the bowing down.

<|startoftext|>I know. Go figure.  I never understood it. They don’t get it? Or they do get it but don’t care? 🤷‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I imagine #Pence would be President until Jan 20.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope they have results during my lifetime. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamcbest It gives #Trump a chance to piss, moan, cry about the crooked election and file his numerous lawsuits while we have 97% of votes in. 😡Yea, does make me wonder why???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. I’m gonna stop watching at 7:00 and find a good movie. I’m tired of this 97% counted but we still can’t call it BS.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Glad to hear is he’s ok Thanks! 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought she was talking about Rachel. I missed the beginning but Nicole said she was exposed to Covid and tested negative but is isolating. I assumed it was Rachel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m beginning to think this will very well go thru next week.  Almost seems like they’re milking it to pacify #Trump??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yea,but still not enough to  Call it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It pretty amazing how unprepared they are to handle so many ballots. We knew it was gonna be an election with more voters than usual. They have too few workers working their butts off. Should have planned for way more counters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And then they’ll still have a reason to delay. 🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Good idea. I sure Mr.”Art of the Deal” would love a reduced sentence. 😉<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hell no!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow! What a shocker.  I sure hope we know by Jan 20th. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Didn’t we hear Tuesday that certain states will announce Wednesday, then Thursday AND then Friday came along. 🙄 Here we are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly.  They should call it. This could go up to next week. Seems llike he’s being catered to. 🙄MAYBE if #Biden wins one more(any) state, they’ll have the nerve. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh for sure. You notice how silent they are right now? They just bow down to him.  🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree, with Covid being the number one issue. However I’m sure Biden will be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. I’m guessing he already has plans for reuniting those children.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you think if #Biden gains one of the states today they’ll have the nerve to call it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid Goes to show you, the People’s vote in the end does not really matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we know damn good and well if it were Trump that was ahead it would’ve been called by now. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please do. And while you’re at it, check into his association with his supreme court picks. He has made statements indicating they will help him out. I think that deserves investigating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congratulations to you David. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You should be proud #David. I have been following your work and your enthusiasm and fight for the cause. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope it’s before January 20. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know you guys have had it really rough. I know the fear having had to evacuate a few years ago. Very scary. My prayers are with you and all of NoCal. 🙏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I forgot about that one. That’ll add one more to the Dem Senate race right?  We would need, one more or two?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If it were reversed, and #Trump was in the lead/likely winner, I’ll bet the media and States would have called it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree. I don’t get it. And it’s getting very frustrating.  We may very well go into next week with the same ballot counting and recounting. I hope they know by January 20. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ElectionResults. I am really beginning to wonder why this ballot counting is taking so long. Hire more ppl. Four days and we still don’t have a winner, officially. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Breaking n #MSNBC Ok, as I understand it PA allowed late votes extension due to Covid. They are reporting that Republicans are asking SCOTUS to not count those votes for now. I’m not exactly sure why. Anyone else understand what that’s about?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For sure. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I sure hope so. 🤞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How cool. 👍 I keep saying, other countries will be overjoyed and a penguin attention to our election. Many people will be extremely happy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Exactly. I said don’t make a big deal out of it if he doesn’t want to make a concession speech, so be it. Just say goodbye and go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good for you Bill. It gets easier from here. It’s been 13 years for me. One of the smartest things I’ve ever done. Keep up the good work. 👍<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Great idea!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are living Ground Hogs Day. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I asked same thing. In particular the GA ones in which if Dem win, could give Dems the senate.  I’m sure each ballot has all contenders and they’d have to be counted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha!!! I smell massive desperation! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha!!!  No kidding. Enough already!! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, with all these massive ballot dumps goin on in GA, that should also affect the senate races no??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#ElectionResults2020  You guys, I’m getting very hopeful. Lots of new returns for #Biden. 👍🙏🏻👌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t worry.  When he’s the official winner, we will be dancing in the streets. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What if all these high hopes; #Kornacke and his big board; all pundits indicating a #Biden win......and what if it doesn’t happen?  We thought Hillary had it too. 😠<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You would think so. Certainly worth investigating, yet I doubt it’ll happen. If it were a Dem Pres that chose them, then they’d do something. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They sure have. I’ve lost respect for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reason enough to NOT have heron SCOTUS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. I tell myself not to get too confident. I just want them to call it. #Biden win and I’ll be good. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ElectionResults2020 Damn!  Will they just announce results already?  Geez, it’s been two days and we get bits/pieces....bunch of nothing 😡 I’m getting impatient. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MSNBC broke away and ended it right away I don’t know if their end up going back to it. I see CNN is still showing it. Isn’t it pretty unbelievable?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Both those runoffs could give us the Senate if they win, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ElectionResults2020  I really was hoping we’d get some kind of election results today. Damn, this is taking forever. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait, they’re showing #Biden at 264? Or was that a “what if” chart?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boy,that woman doesn’t look too happy. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ElectionResults2020  I keep seeing senate race, Ds 47, Rs 48. Rs are only one ahead now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hell no!  😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good for Twitter! 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good job Jacob! Had him running scared. He had NO answer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WTF 😡I pray #Biden doesn’t comply but fear he will.  Mitch McConnell already challenging Joe Biden’s authority to govern  https://t.co/HYszSyKqV8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You buying?  😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He did?  That would be awesome. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No.  Are you sure? I’ve never heard of a president running a second time. Of course with this particular person nothing should surprise me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Election Ok, just tuning in. Someone tell me why they stopped the counting in PA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ya think!  😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now this would be awesome.   How Georgia Could Give Democrats Control of the Senate With Kamala Harris as VP  https://t.co/XXrlThPDtl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you know if anybody is doing anything about this? That’s a huge amount to just let slide and could change the outcome of the election. I don’t get why this is not news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ElectionResults2020  if GA has not called yet and still counting votes, isn’t it possible that #Oosoff and all other seats could change status?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YES!!  👍👌There’s so much damage to undo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulianCastro In regards to eliminating the electoral college, It seems you could easily rest your case on that alone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wouldn’t that percentage be a mandatory recount?  I don’t get it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only thing is, it MUST be a two way street. Dems can’t just sit back and be stepped all over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly what I wanted to know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is he an incumbent?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awwwww 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good!!!! 👌👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, he’s so close. I have a feeling we will know tonight. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok,#Biden has 253 E votes and I hear AZ results will come shortly. How many e votes for AZ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slappync17 @44mmvvpp @pourquoinon #Rachel showing Senate race as 7 (Dem)/8 (Rs). We must of gained a seat no?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Election2020  Who was it tweeted telling us not to panic if Tuesday we see a Red Wave?  He was right in the end. I’m way more relaxed now than I was yesterday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s good but I was hoping for another Senate seat for Dems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Election. Wow!  #Biden is really gaining in Georgia. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is he an incumbent or new?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We see so much of that kind of behavior from #Trump supporters. Are they uninformed, unaware, uncaring or just plain stupid? 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree but I just don’t think they will. 🙁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha. I’m waiting for her t 🤞to sing 🎶😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ElectionResults2020  Just heard MI (my home state)went to #Biden. Woo hoo 👌👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ElectionResults2020 I am more and more at ease as the day progresses and #Biden’s lead grows. Main thing is, he wins, no matter how small the margin.  Is any senate seat gain possible at this point or are they all accounted for?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HKrassenstein They aren’t obligated to give their names are they? If they’re #TrumpThugs, I’d sure as hell would t want to give my name.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joncoopertweets Wa wa wa! Take your toys and go home....”YOU’RE FIRED.”🖐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly, yet that’s what Dems do. Reach out then get sh*t on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Biden2020 #MSNBC announcing #JoeBiden as the apparent winner in WI. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Election So, am I understanding that WI said they are doing a 3rd check to certify results? Biden is ahead; 10 Electoral votes. I assume WI will go to #Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@44mmvvpp Now, are there ANY senates seats left that Dems could possible get, or is that not gonna happen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait! 27%?  Why shouldn’t they put FL back in the “too early” category. It’s always crooked FL. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure if it applies to only FL, but #MSNBC just reported a federal judge ordered USPostal to appear n court to explain missing/late ballots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Elections2020  Tho I really really didn’t expect election to be this close AND am disappointed in Ds not getting enough senate seats (so far), I’m am somewhat relieved to see this morning #Biden taking leads in several swing states. 🙏🏻🤞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wtf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God, I hope so! 🤞🙏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lol woke up at 3:30. 🙄🙁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ThePostElection  Could this possibly end up another Electoral college win and not people’s vote?  🙄 It’s Dems turn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m sure he doesn’t realize (or care) that he sound like the total moron that he is. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Extremely close. 😳<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>How many e-votes?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. It’s beyond belief.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MSNBC2020 I thought they called FL for 45, but #MSNBC shows it’s still up for grabs. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Election2020 I googled #SusanCollins and it showing she’s ahead of her challenger like by 20 points. Anyone confirm?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MSNBC2020 #MarkKelly ahead of #McSally 55.5/45.5. So if he wins that’s two senate seats. We need one more right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He did?  Oh sh*t!  Damn! 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MSNBC2020 wow, #Kornacki sure making it sound grim for #Biden. 🙁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤞🙁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MSNBC2020 Did they give any info on the #Graham/Harris race??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I didn’t think it was called???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ElectionDay  Sorry to hear #MoscowMitch won. 🙄😡🙁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Election2020 I am so pleased to hear that all and all voting is going smoothly. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ribeye steak, sautéed mushrooms, potatoes. Oh, and 2 chocolate chip cookies for dessert. 👍😆😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Election2020 Btw, what time do first polls close, 7 est?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ElectionDay tho it’s only 1pm here in Ca, I ha 3 not heard any reports of major voter intimidation or violence today. Am I right@.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s for sure. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m telling you, if #Biden wins, I’ll bet most of the world will be celebrating. 👍🤞👌🙏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👌👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ElectionDay Anyone think that the young voters will surprise everyone and come out in droves today?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a fantastic ad. How powerful! 👍👌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too bad!!! No sympathy for the Devil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Election  You guys, I hope I don't have my hopes up too high expecting Dems to gain control of the Senate. Am I too optimistic?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I heard that too and wouldn’t rule it out. #Trump always does what’s best for himself. If he loses I’m sure getting pardoned will be his only concern. Thing is, can #Pence pardon him from any charges from NY AG?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenKamalaHarris Raise your hand if you’re a part of that 11 million!! 🖐Go California!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lol. Hopefully we will make that trend for at least 24 hours. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I read #Biden was considering him for a cabinet position. Is that why he’s speaking out now? ‘I’m steaming’: John Kasich demands Republicans ‘find their courage’ and condemn Trump’s ‘ridiculous’ attacks on the election -  https://t.co/PR0f4w2sPF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha. Exactly what I thought. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤞🙏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe he’s somewhere with #Barr ho we haven’t heard from in weeks. God, I pray tomorrow we celebrate. 🙏🏻👍🤞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Election I’m feeling cautiously optimistic, yet am afraid at the same time.  One thing I look forward to is an end to all the e mails/texts I get daily asking for money. Lol. Hope Dems in. 🤞🙏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lol 😂 perhaps that should be his presidential portrait in the White House.  How appropriate. 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree. What he wants means nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg 😳 Do we really want this man baby in the WH? And it doesn’t say much for those kissing his a**. 😡 Trump aides are telling him he’s certain to win the electoral college — while hiding polls from him that say otherwise -  https://t.co/CqWKRQDkl0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought I read that they did have lawyers ready.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Panicking hu?  Yea right.  I think we know which side is doing the panicking.  🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I always heard that OC was really red area of California. I’m convinced now. The stupidity of not caring about infecting people should be illegal. Rights? Bullshit , not in this circumstance. People have the right to feel safe from the virus.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thank you Frits.  I have a feeling if #Biden does win, that most of the world will be celebrating with us. Fingers crossed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank goodness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, I hope so. 🙏🏻🤞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tho I won't get my hopes up too high, I am so glad to hear they are at least "considering" it. Democrats debate fate of Trump probes if Biden wins  https://t.co/LYyCBoYnuy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh that's right. I wasn't considering that not ALL the population can vote. It would seem that polls would be less crowded on election day no?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks Robert!!!! 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I hear 95 Million have voted so far. Anyone know our country population? What percentage is 95 million?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can this possibly be ok?  At what point  will something be done? 😡 CNN forced to walk through Trump ‘rally roulette’ crowd where supporters fake-coughed on them  https://t.co/KeZljAS2qa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg!! Are they drunk or just crazy....or both! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha. Yea, what she said!! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, this time it was not “taken out of context?” Doesn’t that verify why he chose the supreme court justices that he did? Isn’t he admitting it? But it’s OK because it’s #Trump right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha. How appropriate. Maybe it’s an Omen. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow! What a great way to put it. So true!  👍<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>No reckoning: History shows polite, liberal society will sanitize, ignore and absolve the crimes of the Trump administration  https://t.co/9RPlRf8URM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BREAKING Per #Axios #Trump told confidants he’ll “declare victory if it looks like he’s ahead” on Election Day. So, he has final word? Forget I counted ballots. What a crock of sh*t.  #MSNBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djrothkopf @fjudkins1 And who was the Republican Senator that  really reprimanded #Trump by calling him a “knucklehead?”  Wow, that’s pretty damning. 😂 They just can’t quit him. Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He sees flags with his name and all his admirers and it’s an ego boost he can’t resist. 🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If it were Dems doing the terrorizing, Rs would DEMAND Dems condemn this kind of thing and Dems would do it. Rs don’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I didn’t see it, just read it. Was it taken out of context?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One would think so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see it’s BS time again.  I smell desperation. 🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yea, but Dems are too nice. I fear they’ll forgive an forget BUT I hope they show somewhat of a spine and not kick  everything to the curb.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha. I’m thinking you might need Hunters permission. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gee, makes you wonder at what point will these supporters simply not feel the love. 🙄I mean....do you have to be run over by a truck?  In this case, out in the street,  could be literally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha. Really, again??  🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not surprised BUT would like to know what is going to be done about it. 😡 No investigation; no one questioned; no one held accountable?  To whom did this person testify?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ActivateActivsm @KevTKel @kylegriffin1 @SenKamalaHarris @ewarren @maddow @glennkirschner2 @neal_katyal I sure hope #Biden has extra security around him and his team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is my county.  I’m so glad I voted early and turned in my ballot to city clerk office. I hope issues are resolved soon.  Some Riverside County voting sites experience delays due to tech issues  https://t.co/hln6WirQ3J<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I’m sure #Trump will condemn such tactics right? 🙄 He’s bringing out the very worst in our country. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would like to know at what point we can hold this so-called president accountable?  It’s always “we vote him out.”  I’m tired of it. He needs to be impeached/jailed/held accountable. And  Shame on all Rs who are accomplices. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That would 3 times in the last what, 15 yrs SCOTUS would decide election in favor of the Republican. Yea real unbiased court. Pisses me off  😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn! That’s what he’s counting on. He has his bases covered. Oh how outraged would msm/Rs be if ANY Dem said that. Come on ppl speak the hell up. This is WRONG 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg!!He’s admitting it. Makes me wonder if he went over it with his SC nominees. I think it was #SpeakerPelosi who said if election comes down to SCOTUS, 45 appointees must recuse. Sounds like a no brainer at this point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is surprise. 🙄  https://t.co/UMog8WYRan<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Megawatts55 Really, that is NOT a far fetched idea. We all KNOW #Trump only  puts ppl in positions who will help HIM. I think that request should be adhered to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree. There’s no way he’d attend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Florida! Do something NOW!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn’t this illegal?  Will anyone, inluding DT, be held accountable? Or will this fade in the wind, like every  other shady, unethical, illegal thing this administration has done or been involved in?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oops!  That’s “45”  I hope that doesn’t jinx 46. 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously, do you think the media will give this much air time? If it were Obama they would.  😡 I have a little faith. 46 has free reign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I never saw the whole thing either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And it’d be awesome if he put #Obama on the Supreme Court 👍🤞👌🙏🏻<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hell yea!  It’s my hope that Biden will only serve one term and #Harris will run in four years. Time to pass the torch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maddow Looking forward to seeing #Rachel today. Seriously, or anyone on the Supreme Court address this do you think?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s for sure. I’m guessing most of the world will be celebrating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this being reported? Are Democrats saying anything, not to mention Republicans?  Then again we know the Republicans lost any kind of respect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a feeling if #Trump/Rs lose big time they just won’t issue any kind of Covid relief. Why should they, they’ll be leaving anyway.  As usual, the Democrats will have to clean up another Republican mess 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is so totally unacceptable , not to mention unpresidential.  WTF is the outrage? He deliberately does this to get is nut job base riled. Btw, how is this even legal? Oh that’s right, #Trump is above the law. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I read that #Trump said winner must be announced on Election Day. What if all votes aren’t counted? Wtf. Does he think he would have a better chance of winning if vote counting ended on Election Day?yea, they cheat and don’t even try to hide it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They’re all hypocrites.  In it for themselves only. 😡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ha h ha 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankFigliuzzi1 @linda_wed1 So, can this go to SCOTUS?  Isnt this the reason SCOTUS is stacked with RWingers?  They’ll side with #Trump and he’s wins again. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow! How generous of you. 👍 Kudos!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see many still are not wearing masks 😡🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s terrible. You can’t tell me these threats aren’t from Trump loving a**wipes. There is no reason for these threats whatsoever. It’s  pure hate..and that’s exactlywhat Donald spreads. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh  I know. This is the most stressful election ever IMO. I can’t wait til Nov 3 so we will have a clue as to how this is gonna go.  Btw, anyone else sick of daily e mails, texts from everywhere asking for donations? I’d be broke if I gave to everyone 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely!! I regret I never got to see him when he was running/President.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I fear Rs can come up with any excuse they want and with a SCOTUS stacked with lapdogs, they can judge for 45 no matter what. I have NO faith in this SCOTUS. IF they side with 45 it w/b 3rd time in last 15/20 yrs votes did t matter. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg!  He really did that? That’s horrible with all his nut job followers listening?  I’m sure nobody will reprimand him. 🙄😡He can do/say/incite anything. 😡He SHOULD apologize immediately. (I know, yea right 🙄)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Exactly!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. It was unbelievable. Went for a walk and with wind to my back, I barely had to move. 😂All kinds of paper/trash in the area, not to mention a couple fallen trees.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Obama for sure.  He taught Constitutional Law and he’d be fair/just.  Oh, and the fact that it’d really piss Rs off is a huge Plus. 😉👍<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RedTRaccoon @likingyou Isn’t it a matter of days SCOTUS votes on the ACA destruction?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She knew it was safe because everyone else would vote for Coney.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True. I hope they do something. 🙏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope so. 🙏🏻🤞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree. I don’t feel confident that he will<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awwww poor thing. 😢 I pray for her recovery 🙏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish but am I the only me who doubts Dems will expand the Court, let alone impeach anyone?  Their line will be just”let’s move on. “ 🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, both have made me lose respect for the highest court. It’s a joke. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope if Dems win they will expand the court but I am very very skeptical that #Biden or even #Pelosi has it in them. They’ll continue to play nice and not fight back. 😡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>45s counting on her to help him destroy ACA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He looks like he’s having a hard time walking/moving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well if the Democrats have the majority in both houses I don’t think they’ll  need the REthugs votes. I think it’s much like they’re voting Coney in this week. Dems votes don’t matter.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Amen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, I saw clips of Biden n GR (Last week I think). Do you know exactly where he was. Just curious. I’m guessing downtown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly, I think they just want to have something prepared to have on TV, but Trump is waiting for the new Supreme Court to dismantle it. He doesn’t feel he needs anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Btw, hows the weather? Freezing yet?  😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I fear you’re right.  Plus, I don’t have faith that if Dems take both houses, that they’ll have the guts to expand the court. As I I Understand it, they could do it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>True!  He’s so jealous of #PBO that he wants to destroy everything he’s done. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So how could the #SCOTUS get rid of the #ACA next month knowing there’s a pandemic and ppl are dying. Can they possibly be that cold? I’m hoping they’ll ask to see Trumps plan. We know he has none. Then again, court is “stacked” for that reason 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lol that’s what I was gonna say. Doesn’t look like thousands to me. Only in TrumpLand. 😂 if you keep saying it, it becomes true. Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow! You mean the bromance is over? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just heard that Rs may quite possibly rush the SCOTUS nomination thru as early as tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nine days til the election BUT #Trump has almost three months left in power. A LOT could happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They all have that "Botox Barbie" look.  😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@1DancingCrane Jared?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh yea, I forgot about that one. Very scary too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, that was very creepy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes, I believe so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You’re right she does. Maybe it is her.  If it is Hicks, it almost seems like she’s  pretending to be Melania.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My guess, that’s an example of at least 80% of Trumpsters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Weekly Reader!  Lol. Yes, I remember that. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes but like a miracle it’s going to be over. Trump has it all under control. Nobody’s handled the pandemic better than Trump. Hey superman. 🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lol Actually I can’t say I blame her. I wouldn’t be smiling ha ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yea,Melania never smiles when she’s around Trump. 😂 Probably a double, just so ppl think it’s her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plus, haven’t see. #Barr in a while either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha. I don’t remember if he ever wore a tan suit or not. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh yea,  remember Sputnik.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have vague memory of being downtown with my mom. I was about 7/8. There was a lot of commotion and a lot of people wearing. “I Like Ike” buttons as he was campaigning. Other than that I don’t remember any of his presidency for the most part<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Omg!!! 😳He doesn’t even try to hide who he is....or if he’s trying to, it’s not working. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I totally agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg! Republicans seem to really be grasping at straws. 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>God, I hope he wins. 👍👌🤞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m not buying it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree.  I like her and for the most part she did a good job but, should have muted/cut off when candidate goes on and on and says BS/nothing. Also I wish lies could be called out in real time NOT after debate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds about right!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yea, I don’t get what all that was about.  🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>😳😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good point. They let him spew lie after lie. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s “Ramble” BS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#KristenWalker needs to stop letting #Trump rainless BS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think they’re afraid to use the mute button. It may be better just to say they had one. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gee, what a surprise. I thought there was a mute button? I would’ve muted 4500 times by now.  🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s probably when he’ll walk off stage. He can’t stand to be muted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why hasn’t anything been done about it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who’s gonna know (or care). 🤷‍♀️I have no idea who he is. 🙄#Trump wants to turn away from issues and go back to Hunter.  🙄 it reeks of desperation if you ask me<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@stellabystarlit Already did. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Im very suspicious, especially after seeing #Rachel tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good point. We know everything he does is to benefit himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree. I can’t imagine Iran would want #Trump to win. I think it’s Russia but 45 wants to spin it adding another country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Rachel received 16 letters from various ppl threatening them if they didn’t vote for #Trump. Is this what #Ratcliffe was talking about? If so, it’s NOT damaging to #Trump as Ratcliffe said. Will #CBS/media investigate this?Hard to trust this administration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Rachel received 16 letters from ppl rec. threatening them to “Vote for Trump or else. Earlier“ #Ratcliffe said Russia/Iran was responsible, said it was designed to hurt #Trump🤔 that’s not what it sounds like.  He gave no info. Anyone else watching?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He was awesome. Very direct and wasn’t holding back criticism of #Trump. 👌👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ObamaRocks. He is really going after #Trump. 👍 “Imagine if I had a secret bank account in China.”  He’s so great!   I sure miss him. 😢I’ll bet 45 is going nuts. Well, more than usual nuts. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hell no.  😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s not like it’s a totally groundless idea.  I doubt Ds will have the nerve, but we can hope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It sure sounds that way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man,  totally agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha! Two weeks before the election and NOW they decide to distance themselves. What a bunch of chicken sh*t babies. I hope they all lose. They can reap what they sow. 🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree but why am I doubtful that ANYTHING at all will be done....even after the election. 😡🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Omg! My sympathies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boy, that reeks of desperation. The Commission sure as hell better not comply. #Trump wants all foreign policy so he can spin the #HunterBiden bullsh*t story. 🙄😡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>She did. I don't recall her exact words but she made a distinction indicating that #MSNBC didn't make the decision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I believe it. It was exceptionally hot for days on end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course we know not to count on her, but don’t Ds need three votes? Also, when is the vote?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey, I quit after 40 some years. You can do it! 😉 I am definitely voting for #Biden.  Will follow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, I went to the Secretary of State‘s website as per my ballot to get locations where I can drop off my ballot. I for sure am not going to go to the post office. My daughter also is going to do the same.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>His entire presentation should be aired a couple times so people who aren’t following this can get a grasp of what’s going on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow! I’m so glad that I am not alone and being so impressed with #SenatorWhiteHouse’s excellent presentation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I certainly hope the media and Pondens will be talking about this because he did an excellent job. And the people have a right to be aware of this. Doesn’t say a whole lot for the courts though, it seems that can be bought.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree. I’m really impressed. He spelled it all out and had quotes and info to back it up. Good job. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SCOTUSHearing  #SenatorWhitehouse doing a good job pointing out WHY we s/b concerned about SCourt pick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, really?  Then again sounds like him and GOP. They don’t seem to care at all. What must the ppl think tho.? What a sarcastic, shi**y reply.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I certainly hope Amy’s poll ratings go up more. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously, can’t we the people sue? Class action or something?  One would think each state could change their rules but evidently they like making it harder to vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They also played “Fortunate Son” (CCR)at one of 45s rallied. 😂what a slam to Trump   😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good luck Amy!!! Many of us are rooting for you! 👍🤞👌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That IS so wrong. I pray changes are made soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know what else? Yesterday while on a walk. I noticed mail scattered all over the street. All of it was the blue info book they send you “before” they send the ballots. Addresses not my area. Today it was gone. Gotta be Rs trying to push for 45s agenda. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here too I really like it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I noticed a link on the info I got with my ballot, showing drop off locations. I’m assuming that’s reliable. I have it ready except I have to go over all the propositions. 🙄 that can be confusing.  Thanks!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a feeling this will be a historic election turnout. I’ll bet highest turn out ever. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes! If we’re lucky. 🙏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s probably what I’ll do. City clerks office is not very far. God, I hope that’s safe. 🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is that really his expression during debates. Awful look.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1DancingCrane Sean, there is a Dropbox right by my house (couple blocks away). I googled a screenshot of the street and it looks like a regular neighborhood. Dont know if that’s an odd place for a Dropbox. Then I hear this Rs tampering, makes me very leary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, I’m hearing they won’t comply. Then what?  🤔I want to drop. My ballot off.  What’s a safe link that has my options? Also, is there a sure way to tell official drop boxes to fake ones? Arrest these crooks 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly!!!! 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yahoo News/YouGov poll: As opposition to Trump's pandemic approach grows, most voters want Senate to pass stimulus before considering Amy Coney Barrett  https://t.co/3oKaUdj83V<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe it’s time to take the next step,  arrest people. There should be consequences<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I sure hope so David. We need them. 🙏🏻🤞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It seems inexcusable for people to have to wait in line for hours to vote. And for the states who are purposely trying to drive voters away, there should be serious consequences. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She’s caving!  She will fall in line.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She was great, as usual. 👌👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump actually discussed wearing a Superman shirt when he left the hospital?? 😂😂OMG, Talk about delusional.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was in 12 when #jFK ran. I remember neighborhood kids saying the Pope would move in the WH if JFK won AND instead of “In God we trust on coins, it’d be “In The Pope We Hope.” 😂Was ridiculous. #JFK gave great speech on religion/politics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wtf. 😡I plan to drop off my ballot within the next day or two. How do I know if they’re legit? I sure as hell hope whoever is responsible gets punished big time. Talk about desperation on the Republicans part. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nprpolitics And #Trump continues to deflect on his taxes; and on his Covid-19 testing; and on Russia bounties on our troops; not to mention submitting his dna for a rape charge.  Etc.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh man!  That should be a felony. 😡 I guess the only sure way is to deliver right to county clerk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep!  The sower went out to sow his seed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m in CA. Tho I haven’t sent n my ballot yet this election.  There is a site they refer you to to track your ballot and know when it’s received.  Very easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disaster is putting it mildly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All good, but I’d go with Yates.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hjelle_brian Same thing #Moscows being doing for years.  No problem!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awwww. Happy Birthday!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha. Sounds just like him. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I received my ballot yesterday. I’m definitely voting straight Democratic ticket, but there’s a lot of propositions that I got to go over tomorrow and decide how I’m going to vote on those. Man, it’s like reading a novel LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds good. And then perhaps we can get universal healthcare add more supreme court justices, what kind of climate change etc. That would be great<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👍👌🤞🙏🏻🖐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All of them???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I didn’t watch. How did he sound? Sound sick?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, ain’t that the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well looks like DT has a new BFF. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can #Pence pardon him for the SDNY charges?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it’s reasonable for all attendees of #ConeyBarrett confirmation be tested for CoVid. Plus Coney already had it.   COVID outbreak at private school attended by Amy Coney Barrett kids: report -  https://t.co/zqSi14iUL3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bye.  🖐Don’t let the door hit you in the a** on the way out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get tested. Proves that you don’t have Covid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If this is true, or even if it is it, they probably should test every member of Congress who is exposed to Covid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If true, what a selfish SOB. Exposing others to a virus simply to get his choice of a supreme court justice? That’s a republican party of today. I wonder how many others have CoVid but don’t care because they want to vote for SCJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahh that makes sense. He is afraid he has CoVid.  How many others that were exposed are fearful and will not test for the same reason? Lindsey Graham refuses COVID test — so he can hold Amy Coney Barrett hearings even if he’s positive: reports -  https://t.co/VeYn3JsHRL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump attempting to raid Medicare trust fund in ‘shameless stunt’ to pay for drug discount cards with his name on them: report -  https://t.co/4RwzbyMq2P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yea, got my #MailInBallot here in Ca.  Refers me to drop off boxes if I choose.  Probably the most important vote of my lifetime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow! 😳wasn’t that, at the time, the biggest gathering ever?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What?  Again? Why? All else fails, go back to HRC e-mails? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MSNBC banner Trump says "We have a cure for CoronaVirus." What???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes’ the Small Penis Club<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NO Sympathy for the Devil. 👿 They can reap what they sow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yea but can she do so without help from Rs? I’m guessing they won’t cooperate at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or blame #Obama.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With #Pence cancelling his events tomorrow, and spokesperson saying he’s not sick, I wonder if it has sometimes g to do with #Pelosi’s #25thamendment announcement? Not sure what’s going on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lmao 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha 😂👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, does that mean it’s not true/made up story?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perhaps all she have to do is mention that she’s going to have an event about the 25th amendment, he’ll go crazy and will prove her case. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m sure will hear from him anytime. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, if true, #Trump is lying?  What a shocker. 😳🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And of course we can always believe the “spokesman” right? I wonder if we will ever find out. We have a right to know if both Pres and VP have CoVid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes they are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s exactly what I was wondering.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MSNBC  OMG! #Trump says he got CoVid from the Gold Star families, who always come up to him and want to hug/kiss him. WTF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How would that work? Does congress have to vote on it? If so, can't count on any Rs. Also, I assume a doctor/psychiatrist would give input???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait! A 26th amendment event? 🤔For real?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gee, wonder who’s inspiring these terrorists? 😡 Militia began kidnapping plot shortly after Trump praised armed anti-Whitmer protesters as ‘very good people’ -  https://t.co/CfGeHv6azf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MisterMike92660 @Gdad1 @realDonaldTrump @GOP Of course that makes the GOP (a hate group itself) live her even more. 🙄This is what our country has become.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right!! 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, but it seems we keep saying that, everyone knows it but nobody can (or will do anything about it). 🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>EXACTLY!! Let's call it what it is....terrorism!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PresDebate. #MSNBC is reporting #Trump won’t debate virtually but may hold a rally instead. Are his supporters really that stupid that they’d attend a rally?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Rachel and panel we’re talking about a fly on his head  a good part of the time. I didn’t notice, but they showed a pic. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#KamalaWonTheDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Debate. #Pence didn’t answer question about DT health plan/preexisting conditions, but goes on about Ds packing SCOTUS and nobody insists on an answer and mod never pursued.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Debate. #Pence is getting more time than #Harris. These mods have to be tougher and cut this mic when they go over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Debate. That moderator needs to turn #Pence mic off. He keeps yapping beyond his time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or, as we'd say in the olden days, "Did he get his degree from a cracker jack box.  😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What kind of a Mickey Mouse doctor is he????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ll bet he does. He’ll even send checks with his signature on them. 😂 He IS that vain. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yea, but those e-mails. And don’t forget #Benghazi. 🙄🙄 That’s what Rs always go back to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. Who could have imagined we’d have one group who totally puts their party before country. It’s scary. Could SCOTUS step in? I mean, if they see our country being destroyed? Or must they wait til somebody else speaks up?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, #Trumps doctors say he’s been symptom-free for 24 hours. Do we really have any reason to believe that’s the case? Should we trust the doctors? I don’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg. No,I had no idea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who? I never heard of her (?)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this normal?? Experts alarmed as DOJ issues unusual memo allowing prosecutors to take steps that could interfere with elections  https://t.co/18lxiBxfeM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree on both counts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree. Unless they are at different locations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden says ‘we shouldn’t have a debate’ if Trump is still positive for coronavirus  https://t.co/HALye7omKP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m concerned too. You’re right, any of the #Pence staff, knowing how careless they are about CoVid protection, could likely easily spread the virus. They should do it via separate locations if you ask me. Plexi glass is good idea tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Rachel #AOC coming up next.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually, I am concerned about #Harris and her debate with #Pence tomorrow.  Even though, as far as we know, he hasn’t tested positive, he never takes any precautions to avoid Covid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I kind of don’t blame him, do you? Let’s do ittwo separate locations doing it via zoom or something Biden says ‘we shouldn’t have a debate’ if Trump is still positive for coronavirus  https://t.co/HALye7omKP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I predict.....many more to come.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn, he's gotta realize, being VP, how risky this is for him no?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a feeling there are many more that tested positive but haven't said anything yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BREAKING #MSNBC #Trump adviser #StevenMiller tests positive for Covid19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jenminicooper @charliekirk11 Ditto!! 🙄🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What? That not only sounds shady, but seems illegal as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Btw, speaking of arrogance, did you hear #Pence refuses any kind of extra protection during debate tomorrow. #Harris will use a plexi-glass coverage but #Pence won't. Bet no mask either. WTAF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He was horrible. He actually didn't know or have an answer for anything. I would have turned off his mic and said goodbye. Very disrespectful, rude, arrogant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was awful. The guy just kept talking w/o answering the question she asked and spent his time trashing #Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#KatyTur, just shut that guy off and say goodbye. He's a total idiot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who is this Trump Lapdog that #KatyTur is interviewing? OMG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MSNBC reporting that #Trump blocking CDC from guidelines on CoVid not wanting them to say a vaccine won't be ready before the election. I think I'll wait for a #Biden Presidency before I trust ANY vaccine during this administration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CNN Reporting that #Trump is calling drug companies telling them to move faster to find a vaccine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ted Cruz has it???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You got that right. The embarrassment goes on and on. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He’s a major hypocrite?  Totally useless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We’ll have to see how often and how long he talks when he  makes comments. It’ll be easier to see if that’s the case. We all know it won’t be long as he always comments about something. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hear you. For him to pull this off seems unbelievable. He’d have to have Drs at WalterReed go along with him. But then you think he got the entire Republican Party to take a political bullet for him. I guess anything is possible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Couldn’t they do a Zoom type debate? There’s no audience right? With #Pence so adamant about not wanting protection against CoVid, I’m thinking he could be next. Don’t trust him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhilArballo2020 I certainly hope you win #PhilArballo2020. 🙏🏻👍👌🤞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s probably written in a memo somewhere that you can’t sue a sitting President. 😡Especially not in an election year. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a feeling a lot more senators have it and/or fear they have it than we are being told. #Trump likely ordered everyone to shut up and the obedient little lapdogs do as they’re told. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We can’t trust the President, congress, (Dems aren’t doing much either)the CDC, and soon, SCOTUS. WTF😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t understand how this isn’t taken seriously.  We just wait til most of the country dies? Is that the goal? WTF is nothing this guy does Illegal, immoral, unethical or just plain wrong? I’m tired of this disaster 😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I KNOW I read that she had Covid herself (and recovered). WHY would she not wear a mask and why isn't msm bringing the fact up?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can you imagine the movie of his administration? I think many involved will look like the total fools that they are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And yet they'll suck it up? I wonder WHEN some brave soul/s will step forward and tell us what's going on. One would think that once your life is at risk, you just might want to step up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, that's what I was referring to. I know he's used that terminology before. Only in HIS mind is he that great. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh for sure. Remember he said something like that before, how ppl were amazed at how much he knew about Science (I think). Totally sounds like him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG! He actually said that? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG, that is really scary. 😲<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And although I don’t expect the Democrats to do or say anything, I wonder if any Republican will come forward concerned about his behavior. My guess, no. It won’t be till after the new SCOTUS is confirmed. That’s their dream. Damn all else<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, I guess if anyone can tell the difference between his normal behavior and crazy behavior it would be a family member.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“The President is a phenomenal patient and has been working hand and glove with us.” DTs doctor just now. Gee, I wonder if he was “coaxed” as to what to say. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump probably demands that they let the people out there. After all, it’s all about him 24/7. He loves being adored. He lives for being adored<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I kind of agree. It’s hard to tell, he lies about everything, but the fact that everyone around him seems to be getting the virus, and he’s always so careless about not following directions, that is possible he has it. But yes he’s acting like it’s no big deal it’s over with<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He is trying to act like he’s had Covid, he’s cured, and the whole problem is over with. Only the idiots follow him or believe it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even while having the virus you continue us to play it down.  🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’d sure like to see some of those “arrows in their quiver” that #Pelosi talks about. IMO NOTHING will happen before the election and even if Ds take both houses, I look only for moderate changes. Dems will have the “forget the past/move on” attitude.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would that possibly explain why it seems the entire GOP stands adamantly by 45s side?  It’s not new to them, they too are under Russia’s thumb?  🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#kayleighmcenany  I have a feeling there are so many more ppl to come forward. My guess, many are being told to not say anything unless necessary. This is unbelievable. AND Rs remain silent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CNN “Trump is demanding to leave hospital.”  Sounds like DT. I imagine even the doctors will kowtow to him.  Unbelievable. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I totally agree but I don't know if he will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously? Is that all they got?  🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I didn’t hear he self quarantined.  Could he be he has symptoms or has CoVid?  This administration never tells us what’s going on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This kind of blows me away.  It's so abnormal, not to mention dangerous and stupid and insane. WTF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SecretService. I also thought this was a joke at first. Does anyone see how this possibly makes him look good/normal/well in any way?How are the Republicans defend this stunt?  Makes him look mentally unfit if you ask me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait! What?  🤔He left and then he turned around and went back? I’m confused. Is this true? If so, this with an ego boost for #Trump IMO.  TThere were some people out there rooting for him, and he lives to get his ego stroked If this is all true this is why he left and went back.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ha ha. Good one!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If true, then honestly isn’t it just a matter of time and he too will get COVID-19. I just do not understand the Republican nut jobs stubbornness to admit this virus is a killer. I don’t get it. Are they that stupid?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What?  What a POS. Did #Harrison respond?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Did he suddenly start having symptoms?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lol That’s what I thought. 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neeratanden Perhaps Donald instructed them to do so because he didn't want t appear weak. You know he always has to be the tough guy (tho he comes off as weak IMO)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you #Rachel. I felt as tho the Drs were told to do the "happy dance." IF he's doing well, that's good news BUT If Drs are covering per his instructions, that's not good at all. I don't trust them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Cnn reporting #Trump has had fever since this morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not just moderate but VERY moderate. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which makes me wonder how much more is being kept from us. If a day or two goes by and we don’t see/hear from him, I’ll wonder just how sick he really is. We KNOW we can’t trust any Republican for the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What does that mean. He’s more sick than he wants the public to know??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t forget how this WH lacks  any credibility. They SAY 45 has mild symptoms. We have no reason to believe anything they say. We will see if/how soon he will speak. If we don’t hear something from him, I’m guessing it could be worse then mild symptoms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #Barrett had Covid earlier (and recovered) why wouldn't she wear a mask, and did she inform the crowd that she once had it??? I'm guessing 45 team knew but didn't want to say anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope none of them get COVID, but for God sake, it’s not like Covid is new. All of us know what protective measures to take. 🙄😡Did they think they were immune to getting it?  I don’t understand their carelessness.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Does anyone else think it's totally possible that the WH could downplay Trumps condition calling it mild even if it were to become more serious?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’d get him out of the debate?  I think that’s why he appears so willing to quarantine.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joncoopertweets And this is all legal, not to mention ok? Isn’t this very incriminating?.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhh thanks. I was wondering what FinCen was too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👍🙏🏻🤞👌🖐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As much as I hate most of the Rs, and as much as voting out #Trump is essential, I must admit,  voting out #MoscowMitch will really make me ecstatic. Wow! I’d party hardy. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahhhhhh!  Now it makes sense. #Trump is looking to benefit Trump. I certainly hope that even though they get well-deserved aid, that it does not inspire them to vote for this monster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can’t imagine why now. 🤔🙄 it couldn’t be more obvious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Waitwha85766617 Wow! I’m showing my age, but I have. I remember WAY back they had a special $1.00 a carload. Some ppl(kids) would hide in the trunk if the car was full. 😂 I liked them. Always a double feature. 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow! 😳  https://t.co/21LhqsP18A<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She’s absolutely right. #PBO would NEVER do things 45 does, BUT if he did he’d be impeached/removed right away. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sou Ds like a 10 yr old kid. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope so. I’ve thought that several times tho. 🙁Anyone wanna bet on what exactly will be the last straw?  Or, will there never be a last straw?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>No sh*t. Doesn’t that just piss you off? This guy can do anything. 😡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I think their plan is to announce BEFORE the election the date that they "say" a vaccine will be ready. They have no idea what the F they're doing. ALL political. Don't buy their bullshit!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No thanks!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No I didn't see it. LOL I prefer to call him a POS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope so. I wish he’d leave<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🙏🏻🤞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course. Cause the #GOP just LOVE that disinformation coming from their boss/Putin/Russia. 🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I totally agree. If a vaccine did come out I would NOT take it. Hopefully when #Biden is president, things will normalize.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just today #Trumps CDC director said vaccine timeline for covid w/b around next summer. Just moments ago, #Trump said he was wrong. How the f**k can we trust any vaccine?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politvidchannel That’s great. I can also picture him doing #Trump. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree. I’m guessing we will hear nothing until after Jan 20. SCOTUS would not want to make waves for #Trump. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I’m sure #Trump loves him even more. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I always thought he wasn't as rich as he pretends to be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TrumpTownHall Not that I’d watch, but I didn’t know he was having a town hall. Only his fans invited I presume?  I can only imagine. 🙄 Another bullsh*t rally?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else think #Trumps pushing for a #NobelPeacePrize? 😂😂😂 I do   He can't stand that #PBO received one and is trying to be the peace maker. Yea right, as he encourages violence/discord/disease in his country. 🤬🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And what a shame that we have a moron for a President with idiotic lapdog Republicans kissing his a**, totally denying the science. THIS President could kill us all....and powers that be will let him 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“They’re all saying” Right!🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump:  “I’m not concerned at catching the Corona virus because at this stage it’s very far away.”  Really? And ppl buy this? Wtf Why isn’t the CDC/health experts coming down hard on him.? He’s a f-ing liar. Ppl s/b outraged. He’s gonna kill us all. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can you imagine how many times he’d repeat the same bullshit aka LIES? 🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do think he’ll leave. However, we know he will blame Dems, media etc to make himself free of any blame. He will NEVER admit he did anything wrong and will forever bitch about it,BUT he will be gone, thank God. 🙏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awwww. I agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha. 😂Sure he does. Like he’d last that long 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GOOD!!! I sure hope it helps because the #TrumpKlan is itching to win the election EVEN by cheating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t they make attendees sign waivers not to sue if they get CoVid? They attend (mask for most) at their own risk?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You would think he’d lose the election then, but I’d be surprised if he did. Pleasantly surprised, but surprised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see it Pam.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t no how worried I should be. 🙁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You got one from their gardener? 😂Oh man, I'm jealous. I'm sure it was an oversight. 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg! I am getting emails and texts constantly asking for money;or take surveys. A new approach I notice, is the subject line saying “ we are packing our bags”, implying it’s all over. LOL I get texts from Pelosi, Harris, Warren and even from Pete Buttigieg.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It would not surprise me at all. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whatever he says/does is always to benefit HIM. Not sure if he's hoping to make money off vaccine or if he's thinks it's an election win for HIM, but to answer your question, NO he does NOT care if Americans die. S/b obvious by now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s what we are all saying, what the hell did you do this for? He has done nothing but destroy our country and its credibility, not to mention encouraging hate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“ What’s in it for me?”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, I’ve been so worried about that. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TrumpResign The more I think about it, and knowing Congress will do nothing to get rid of him, I do think 45 may get to the point where he's in a corner and resign. AND, like #Cohen says, it'll be before Nov. 3, so #Pence can pardon him. He's off the hook....again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just waking up for work after 1st plane hit; then 2nd we knew it was intentional. I worked in school office. When we stood for the pledge, it was so extra meaningful that day.  Mood was solemn/sad all day. 😥<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Corrupt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He’d be bragging that HE now owns the tallest bldg in NYC. You know...the important stuff. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, BUT will she speak out NOW so we know wtf is going on or do we wait for a book? Either way, I have very little hope that ANYTHING at all will be done.  Sad, but true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder if she's gonna speak up now (in detail) about her concerns, or do we wait for her book???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“They’re Especially concerned that NBA teams offered there arenas” This RW group want to suppress Black voters. What crooks 😡 Religious right groups training thousands of volunteers to help interfere in the election -  https://t.co/7aYm89ymqp<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Now just IMAGINE if #MichelleObama stood there silent like #Melania. The msm/Rs would be trashing her to bits, BUT Melania (and 45) always gets a pass. Pisses me off!! 😡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wow! That’s amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh yea, and because the governor there is so trustworthy and honest, everybody will be rushing for the bar. They are crazy if they do. I would not trust that guy as far as I could throw.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Omg! Rudy, Cruz and Cotton?? God forbid! 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was evacuated once here in CA a few years ago I know the fear. Take what you need and leave ASAP. Stay safe my friend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!! 😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd like this to go to the SCOTUS just to see if THEY are as political and vote by party. This is nuts. IF these ppl get Covid, why the f**k should they NOT sue?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unless there's a real "legitimate reason for this ruling, isn't this the epitome of political?  Talk about showing your true colors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can't tell me that if this were #Obama, that impeachment inquiry/trial wouldn't have started already. 🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. This is shocking and SEEMS illegal/impeachable??? BUT, I just don't think there is anything #Trump can do that will inspire Congress to investigate/impeach.  They don't seem to care. I fear what might happen between now and 1/20/21.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You would think. I have not heard any Democrat even suggest it let alone show any real outrage. It seems it’s become acceptable for this particular president to do as he pleases. 🙄😡 we simply have to wait and hope we can vote him out it seems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Biden, California also.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TrumpKnew<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know! I know! In the meantime, he can do absolutely anything he wants to inconsequential quite a bit from now till January.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any Republican outraged? Anyone at all? Is #SusanCollins a bit “disturbed/concerned?” AND, are Dems calling for at minimum investigations, not to mention impeachment. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tho this to me seems very serious and something a President should be removed for, I can’t help but think it’ll be another go nowhere/dropped story. It seems THIS President IS truly above the law. 😡I wonder WTF it’ll take to kick his ass out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope #Obama is on the list. He’d be perfect! 👌😉😃<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tonyposnanski Ha ha!  I saw it and thought perhaps it was a last name of someone I didn't know. If #Trump spelled "liar" that way, it's hilarious!   So Presidential. 😂🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really don't know WHY this isn't a bigger story. My God, proves the case that these maskless events DO spread the virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great segment showing all #Trumps lies within the past 24 hours, with video tape proving each lie. It's unbelievable how the heads up their a** Klan refuse to see it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She sure will. I wish SHE could debate #Trump. She'd be way better than #Biden IMO. Although, we all know how dumb Trump is by now, and shouldn't take much to emphasize his ignorance. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well duh! He's pushing for a vaccine by Nov. 2nd. LMAO Gee I wonder why that is??🤔🙄🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trumpers bitching election may not be fair to #Trump cause of mail-in voting. Funny, NONE of them are concerned about Russia interference tho. MSM quit fueling the flames.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, #MSNBC reporting that some #Trump supporters think election won't be fair. They KNOW Trump may not win and they're buying his bullshit. AND, the media is fueling the flames.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#KnotsLanding I loved the show. Watched it all the time. #KevinDobson (Mac)was one of my favorite characters. So sorry to hear of his passing. 😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry, at this point, I have my doubts. Politicizing a pandemic like this, and trying to rush a vaccine out before the election, makes me say no thanks, I’ll wait for the real vaccine. Don’t play with our lives. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 😂😂😂😂😂 I’ll bet that’s pretty much what he’d look like if he stood in the rain. 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow!!! Perfectly stated. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow!  You know, that just may work! 😉. So uncomplicated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#earthquake I’m in SoCal here. Didn’t feel it. Not real huge but still scary. You never know if a bigger one is on the way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To that I say “Jeffrey, bring it on!” 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds exactly like what #Trump is trying to do here. He’s learning from his boss 😡  https://t.co/8sFeSdPdKA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I sure hope he doesn't pardon him, yet I can't help feeling a little doubtful. 🤞 It's easy to say now before election. IDK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg! 😳What a psycho. How is this anywhere near normal? How is is it this guy is still President? Surely by now ppl around him would speak up? 😡Yet they are silent? 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I totally believe it. Don’t we all know by now, that is the way #Trump talks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I totally agree with #Kamala.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SoCal Talk about roasting. 111 here in Corona. Suppose to be the same tomorrow. 😲<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂Just like his presidency, a fiasco.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds like a threat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Btw wasn’t it #Kelly that accused a congresswoman (TX I think) of lying about backing a certain program/issue??? He was wrong and refused to apologize. Anyone remember what I’m referring to? I forgot the details but he was a real a**hole imo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure about #Mattis but don’t  trust #Kelly at all. I wouldn’t be surprised if the tries to defend the”Loser/sucker” in Chief.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who the F**k does he think he’s kidding?🙄He knows he needs the military on his side. He is so obvious. What a “loser and sucker” he is. 👎 Not ‘under my watch’ claims Trump after Pentagon push to destroy Stars and Stripes happened… under his watch -  https://t.co/CPbn4A1AIW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GREAT ad!!!!! 👍👌👋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, Weil if #NikkiHaley says so. 🙄😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m sure #Trump is now a big fan of OBL family . All it takes is a little ego stroking.....no matter who does the stroking. 😡🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What could possibly be the motivation to do that?🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha. He chose you to walk back aka clean up his mess?  😂We are on to #Trump by now. No way to defend the “loser and sucker “<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope so. 🤞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You do have a point Darrell.  Half assed logic on their part, but the best of two evils I guess 🙄 Their Klan will likely buy it. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha THAT’S a defense? 😂🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It wouldn’t surprise me. We can’t put anything past him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There must be something in it for HIM. That's how he rolls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chipfranklin Fake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤞🙏🏻 I often wonder what it’s going to take, perhaps this is the breaking point? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha!   That’s probably all we will get from Rs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a peep. Total silence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually, I don’t care for #Kelly and I don’t trust him. Not sure that he will make any comment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, if you’re a Democrat president, yes it would end, because Republicans would be ruthless demanding he step down. This batch of Democrats just do not have what it takes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh I agree ANY Dem would have been totally trashed and asked to step down. 😡Dems are too timid and spineless at times and prefer to use the “vote him out line.” IF we succeed and vote him out I’ll bet NO investigations of his (possible)crimes will ever happen. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m not real familiar with this paper, BUT could this be a WH ploy thrown together after yesterday’s report of #Trump trashing the soldiers because he doesn’t want them to print negative stories about him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was wondering IF any R stepped up. After all they are supposedly FOR our troops. Where’s the outrage? I keep wondering when is the breaking point. I still can’t get my hopes up that Anyone will do anything. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t you just wonder, at this point, what the hell it’s going to take, if anything, for people to actually see what a LOSER #Trump is?? It seems he can do/say anything and not be accountable.  😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CommanderInCheat “People who die in the war are losers and suckers.” OMG! 😳That’s terrible. Where are the troop loving republicans now. Are they outraged? Are they saying what a loser #Trump is?EVERYONE wake the F**k up. This IS who Trump is. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NO WAY!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha ha ha ha 😂😂😂😂. And the sunset with a straight face? 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought 🤔I did. If he was being sarcastic I didn’t get it. Hmmm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But why? Certainly you can understand WHY they should be?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg!! 🙄😳Unbelievably stupid ppl. I do believe this is the logic/intelligence (so to speak), of 45’s lapdogs. Way, way out there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. I dare them. However, I’ll bet they don’t. After the debate, panel discussions will call out lies but not live, sadly. Chickenshits!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn’t this the mayor that spoke out against #Trump?  Figures! RW thugs at it again. 😡 Portland's mayor is moving out of his condo building after protesters broke windows and threw burning debris inside  https://t.co/qapKJYp3Hr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hell no!  BUT, I would NOT be surprised if Dems do just that. It'll piss me off, but not surprise me. 🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, #Trump telling states to have testing facilities prepared for #CoVid19 vaccine by "Nov. 1st"? Nothing suspicious there right?🙄 Come on ppl, wake the F**k up. Can't you see what he's doing?🤬 #MSNBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am wondering if he will even get to this stage. I have a feeling he’s gonna make up some lame to not debate. He sucks at it and he knows it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know, I’m watching too. How scary is that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So where is the Republican outrage? Isn’t it time for hearings and meetings? Shouldn’t you be shouting “lock her up”?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thomaskaine5 Absolutely not.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>NO!  Don’t we all know that’s what’s gonna happen. #Trump will push for it and they’ll throw something out there too quickly. I definitely would NOT trust it. Pretty sad day when you don’t trust your country with something like this. 🙁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course he doesn't. 🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>For sure. If we’ve learned nothing else, #Trump is all about himself and enriching himself. He cares nothing about anyone or anything else. It’s beyond belief how some people don’t see this. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, Time to start the investigations and  hearings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>None of the topics are loading, at least not for me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably to #Trump. It would explain, at least in part,why he doesn’t want us to see his bank records.  I can’t imagine the money going anywhere else but directly to him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes! I can’t either. 🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I’m sure he will get a strongly worded letter or a slap on the wrist and by tomorrow it’ll be all done and forgotten<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha! Exactly. I fear, if there is election interference, especially if Trump wins, the Democrats will send a strongly worded letter telling them how bad they were, and that’ll be it I just don’t expect them to do anything, sadly. 🙁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree. I’m to the point where I shake my head KNOWING all that will happen is basically finger waving/naughty naughty reaction. Dems are determined to do nothing and simply hope that Biden wins...no matter what 45 does. 😡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>LOL, that probably is exactly the punishment (if any) he'd get. A finger wave and " you naughty boy." 🤬🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hear you. So frustrating. All we are told is to vote him out. Scary as hell if he doesn't get voted out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly, #Trump will forbid him/use his powers to stop/stall and delay and NOTHING w/b done. Don't we know the drill by now with this President.  It is leaving precedent however for #Biden to do anything he wants. (not that he'd dare)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I saw the video as well. I did NOT see an attack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That would be great, but I wonder if they have tests from that many decades ago.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes, that’s what she said in her statement earlier today. She was great.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nycsouthpaw And yet as they reported on #Rittenhouse today on #MSNBC, they did not say a word about it. 😡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#MSNBC reporting that the #CDC said it is NOT mandatory to test ppl without Covid19 symptoms. Was pointed out that this was what CDC got wrong in the beginning. You CAN carry virus w/o symptoms. I fear CDC ordered by 45 to say that. Isn't this terrifying? #Cuomo NOT gonna abide.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>On the bright side, it’s saving is from MTP.  👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Im not watching but I assume he’s acting like he’s a “winner” of a nomination with nobody running against him. He can’t resist boasting. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, YOU are the one who created a BIG mess. It’ll take a Democrat (as usual)to clean up the extraordinary mess YOU have made.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No you didn’t tell me. That’s great I’m glad to hear it. 👍As far as #Trump goes, I have it on mute and/or switch the channel. It’s just one of his ego speeches. He opens his mouth, he lies!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh no!! I guess we shouldn't be surprised but damn, how scary.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Pizzmoe, I agree.That is the standard reply to everything underhanded, shady, unethical, or illegal that #Trump does.

<|startoftext|>George Conway drops reminder: Donald and Ivanka Trump donated thousands to Kamala Harris  https://t.co/rDwHKpYPiA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh yes,let’s spew “TheMost Liberal” BS line. That’s the norm for Rs. What? Did Trumpster order you to all say the same thing? 🙄Btw, The Republican Party is the most disgusting. You have NO room to complain.  Rs are digging their own political grave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IF this is true, I just don’t get whyNOBODY in his circle (or not) doesnt say something/show concern 😡If he’s not mentally equipped to run the country, speak the hell up and report your concern. Hiding it should be a felony. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>REMIND #Trump/#GOP every time they slam #Harris AND RT:  George Conway drops reminder: Donald and Ivanka Trump donated thousands to Kamala Harris  https://t.co/2gokkHl9Wu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait! You mean they don’t call him that already!!!😂😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would LOVE that!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha. Oh yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What about Attorney General, any ideas?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Cronyn made the same remark earlier. I think there was a meeting and Trump/Moscow told everybody to use that line. 😂 Watch, I’ll bet more Rs tweet the same. It’s the Republicans old standby line for no matter who the Democrat nominee is. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That line is getting stale. 🙄The Republicans use that line no matter who’s nominated. You might want to take a look at your own party and see how far they are sinking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know right?  This coming from the right wing that’s falling off a cliff and self-destructing for being so loyal to a radical/heartless/selfish President. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BTW, #John Cronyn just tweeted that #Harris was voted the MOST liberal Dem. How many times have we heard that about a dem? They said that about #PBO as well.  I think they need new material. LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So glad to hear it. 😉😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I count on #Kamala to bring this up when Trump attacks her. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh I think there’s always a good chance. He will dump whoever he needs to in order to win, or at least think he’s going to win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg How many times have I heard that line about how many Senators. 🙄It was said about Obama and God knows who else. I doubt that that wine is going to work anymore. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is that right? 😂Well let’s not forget to remind Donny of that when he starts trashing her. As a matter fact, I imagine #Kamala herself will remind him. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh yes. I loved this. 😀She was strong,calm, and didn’t hold back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ewarren @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden #SenatorWarren, I hope you too are on #Biden‘s team. You deserve a role in his administration. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She will do just that. 😂 I wish you could debate #Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t you have a few lawsuits to tend to???  🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Before the day is over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I call bullsh*t. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Biden I just heard on #CNN that #Biden said he wanted his presidency to “be a bridge to the next generation.”  After nearing his VP choice, that he may only serve 1 term.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#KamalaHarris FWIW, I don’t know a lot about her personal life, but I do know I like her husband very much since that time he got up ready to protect her when someone walked on stage when she was running for President. He seems very supportive 👍 Remember that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For sure. We know it's coming!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BidenHarris2020 Damn, I wish #Kamala could debate #Trump. She’d be awesome. 😉👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#VPICK I do hope the others are in #Bidens Cabinet. #Warren, #Rice etc. so any great choices<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#KamalaForVP ALL the nominees were good, but  I couldn’t be more pleased. 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#KamalaHarris Will also be a great first female President. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#VicePresident #KamalaHarris. Nice ring to it.  👍👋👌😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#VPKamalaHarris. Great pick. She will be Awesome!! Congratulations #SenatorHarris!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Breaking!!! It’s #Kamala. 🎉👍👋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Keep spinning #MoscowMitch.  🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BidensVP When announcement is made, let’s start a complimentary thread ASAP and outdo the trashers. 👍NONE of the nominees will disappoint me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, if he loses the election it will be wonderful to see a president who can speak in complete sentences and not make an ass of himself.  👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We will hear all kinds of anti-woman sh*t. ie “She’s too ambitious” Remember RW bitching cause #MichelleObama seemed/looked angry all the time ?All BS.They fear a strong woman can outdo a man and help straighten the mess 45 created. I’m hoping #Harris but will support ANY of them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That would not surprise me. Did he wanted ppl to worry about him? Did they show any video or news story of this shooting?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YES!   I love it!!!!👌👋👍🤞🙏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Inners. I really like #KatieHill. I wouldn’t mind if she ran again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree. Reporters do your job!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I absolutely do. He tells one lie after another. I think all the reporters should stand up and back up a reporter who calls them out on his lies. If he keeps walking out of news conferences it’ll show what a chickenshit he is. Media is way too complacent with him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YES!!!!🤞🙏🏻👍👌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#trumppresser “Children are almost immune from Covid.” LIE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TrumpPresser Why is he continually allowed to lie about mail in ballots calling it election interference. Why don’t the reporters just walked out or everybody stand up and call him a liar. He just rambles on and nobody says anything. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TrumpPresser. Why even bother. 🙄 No more healthexperts, just him spewing his lying “ everything is Rosy”bullshit. Or it may very well be another campaign rally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>EXACTLY.  He is not conning anyone.  Is his fault<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awww Sorry #MoscowMitch. It just seems to fit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A Few Good Men<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that would be awesome. A lot of great people to choose from just from VP choices alone, not to mention many other qualified people not on that list. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, can THIS president, because he is #Trump, override the Supreme Court? Nothing with surprise me. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congratulations!!!!🎉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely!!!! Party in the streets! 🎉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha!!😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yea right! Can’t help but be skeptical. He gets away with anything. 🙄😡 Democrats fear Trump will destroy White House records if he loses — but they have a plan to fight back: report  https://t.co/yCd0jiD0X8<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Totally agree. Since when is being too ambitious a bad thing?? Because it’s a strong woman!  😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously, say he did shoot someone on fifth Ave., I’m beginning to think that won’t make one bit of difference. The president who can do everything and anything he pleases with no consequences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Btw, did #Boltons book change anything? Or Mary Trump’s? Still waiting for #Cohen to spill the beans. Seriously, none of them may make any difference at all. 😡🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True. Seems like by now we would’ve seen these tapes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish. The “October Surprise” maybe???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AND. remember how the Republicans and the media pissed and and moaned until #Obama not only releasef his birth certificate BUT the long form BC. 😡BUT DT not releasing taxes....that’s ok 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great suggestion. 👍I just googled my city, city clerk office and it’s not far from me at all. I think I will do just that and avoid mail. Let’s get this re-tweeted and everybody can check where their city clerk is and know ahead of time. Let’s beat them at their own game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish it were now. I wouldn't mind two capable, strong women on the ticket at all. It's way past time!!!! 👍<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Communicate with each other. Best wishes to you. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well we know #Trump wants tax cuts in his stimulus. 🙄Can he just executive order that? Sounds shady to me, but then this Prez is pretty much allowed to do whatever he wants. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course he does 🙄 I think each  it’s area should designate nearby drop off points for the ballots, avoiding post office altogether, or at least another option<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And still the GOP continues to allow him to destroy our country. A**wipes!! 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahh That’s what I have always understood, that the house has the power of the purse. I didn’t know if this situation makes a difference. So, will this go to the Supreme Court and we wait and wait? 🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Breaking on #MSNBC #Trump to sign ex/order on COVID stimulus. Not sure if he can??? The indication is he will get sued/feedback.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I mean, it’s just hysterical that he’s so obviously a moron. Who said “it is better to remain silent and be thought a fool, then to open your mouth and leave no doubt.” 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It sure appears that way. What a moron.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does he really think we’re that stupid? 🙄😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You gotta be kidding?  😂#ObamaCare did that years ago. No, it’s NOT huge news and Trump can’t take credit for it. 🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Is it possible #Trump ordered Rs NOT to make a deal, so he can do his Executive Order? If so, I thought the house had power of the purse. Would that NOT include stimulus packages?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I still think it’s #Harris, tho possibly #Rice. I’m good with any of the choices.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>How cute. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ll raiseboth hands and said hell yea.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Question regarding #stimulusPackage. Can #Trump “executive order” a tax cut? No approval needed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Although I love music,I am not an expert enough to realize that “ dropping a beat three minutes into a song” was significant, but love the song, and that “Beat”is probably my favorite part of that song. 😉 Nice to see the younger generation appreciate older music 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Biden would struggle? 😂Against the guy who cannot put a sentence together? Yeah right! 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, but then it will be appealed to the Supreme Court which means a longer wait. Then the supreme court will side with 45. I don’t have my hopes up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s a shame that ONLY Dems care. Everyone should speak out against this scheme to stop mail in voting. Actually, it doesn’t even sound legal. 🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yet, hope springs eternal. 🙏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Press must RSVP and arrive by 11:15?  Sounds major.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually, you’re probably right. He likely will NEVER pay for any crime or wrongdoing he’s committed. 😡🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any thoughts as to what she’ll say,or be allowed to say. “Major” announcement??🤔I’m interested.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I like them both. They both would be great VPs. Be prepared for the right wing to trash whoever wins. My choice would be #Harris.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too. AND I am not going to bash whoever he chooses because they are all capable and qualified. There are many who don’t want a woman VP. I say it’s about F- g time. Anybody is better than the garbage we had leading the country now.👍<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My first choice too. I am hoping #Biden serves only 1 term and then #Harris runs. FWIW, I always thought she'd be a great AG as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually #Hillary won the popular vote. More people voted for her than you. It’s the electoral college that got you elected not the people. It’s the electoral college that got you elected not the people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think all the pics are capable/good. I would not complain about any of them. However, #Harris is my first choice. I too think she will be the pic. No matter who it is expect right wing to trash her because they can’t stand the thought of a woman holding a high office. F them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No matter who Biden chooses, the other side has their ammo ready to trash her.  Omar Rs can’t  stand the idea of a woman VP, not to mention a woman of color.

<|startoftext|>Ok, whatever floats your boat 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What I wanna know is, if this is truly the case, that he cannot change the date, why is the media and pundits even giving him the platform to suggested it? Shut it down right now and then tell the world he’s lying again 🙄😡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wvjoe911 Ha ha 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The sad truth about how Trump snookered the endlessly gullible mainstream media  https://t.co/pHFLTvBu3k<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ditto!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Deny the facts. That is the Republican way. Sadly that is what it’s come to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. That is just cruel and insane, not to mention just plain stupid. 🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AND “He wanted to tell staff in person.” 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A GOP staffer just sent a damning note about a Republican lawmaker who just tested positive for coronavirus  https://t.co/glDLqUQHNS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG!  What a moron. Just can't accept facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GregMelvin shut this guy up. OMG!!s AND he's a Dem (GA) WTF? LOL He must be getting big bucks for that adoration of 45. LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤞👌👍👋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Evidently you're in a way different zone than I am. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I mean PORTLAND not Houston. Sorry!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MSNBC WHY do continue to air #Trumps bullsh*t rambling lies. Just cut him off. Report facts NOT lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And all we have to do is wait til November and "vote him out." 🙄Til then he has free reign and can lead us all to hell. So sick of his sh*t!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone watching #Trumps comments about protests in Houston? He says they're gonna clean that city out. Calls protesters anarchists. I am F-ing sick of the 2nd amendment being the almighty but 1st gets sh*t on. 🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I certainly hope so. They should not have been there in the first place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that’s his MO, he did it with Obama. He enjoys bringing our country down, being the grim reaper. However he’s  assuming he’s going to remain majority leader.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And, not just any alien, I believe it was ET. 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>They should, but they won't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe he's gotta call #Trump for advice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politvidchannel We’ll see. I have a feeling somebody somewhere is going to object. 🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes sir!!! She was another Democrat that did a good job<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does #JimJordan get so much time?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BarrHearing Love #Jeffries “Was that superb?” line of questioning 😂👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BarrHearing   I’m liking #Jeffries also. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BarrTestimony  This #Deutch guy is good. I can't say I know him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now #Jordan. I had to mute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BarrHearing  Oh no! #Jordan. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Am I the only one that doesn’t expect much from #BillBarr testimony today? I fear Dems will be weak and not aggressive enough. Won’t ask the right questions. Except for maybe #Kamala who I look forward to hearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>lol 😂😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha!! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha ha ha ha 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. Says it all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I saw that a little while ago, and honestly I thought it was a joke. That’s the actual lineup? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh it’ll be televised?😳 What time?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait! Haven’t we seen this show before? You mean again he’s trying to block it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, one question IF #Barr actually testifies tomorrow....Will #KamalaHarris be one of the questioners??? 🤞🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WilDonnelly Wow!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do too, but that’s asking quite a bit. I don’t look for that to happen but I hope I’m wrong. 🤞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm glad to hear it. At least someone is trying to do something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#VoteCalifornia AND by voting by mail you have little to no chance of voter fraud and Russia can’t mess with it. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Voting by mail is so easy. Everybody should register to do it.  Btw, I think you get an “I voted”sticker in your mail ballot envelope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not surprised.  I am sure he will not be missed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politvidchannel In today’s world and all that’s going on with the virus etc. Would it not be a great time to have/initiate Medicare for all? AND what a perfect time to make mail in ballots available in all states.  I think the majority of the people would be for it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha ha!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No it's Melanie's phrase for her "work" to inspire children or whatever. Always baffled me. Shouldn't it be "be your best?" lol anyway.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok! "Be Best." 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ditto<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Key word is “potentially” aka it’s not gonna happen. Don’t get your hopes up Don’t get your hopes up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg 😳🙄I heard HB was very rightwing. So many of the people just seem plain ignorant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn’t this pretty amazing and out of the ordinary for Russia?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh yea. That was before I moved here but you’re right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha No you’re not. If you ask me he’s very overrated. Yet, he seems to be the hero.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👍Justice is foreign to them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well,  I’d be a little harsher but I suppose she has to watch watch her mouth. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awww happy anniversary and many more ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chickensh*t wimp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrunoAmato_1 I agree. Usually there’s a lot of different proposals you need to vote on. I suggest to read up on those before you actually get your ballot.  Then, you’ll be able to quickly fill in what your position is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree. Rs w/b pissing/moaning in front of camera making top news. Dems are way too timid, especially in this environment. It may take a while but Dems really need new blood mixed in the group.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha. Looks like a claw It’s growing in there somewhere.  😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love it!!!!👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh yeah and as I understand #Trump wants to get another round of tax cuts. Let’s give the rich fat cats more money in their bank accounts and screw everyone else.  😡I say take back that first round of tax cuts and give it to the people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy Birthday Mick. Love the #Stones He still sounds great. How can you hear the Stones and not tap your foot let alone get up and dance?😉 So many songs to mention, at the top of my list “ You Cant Always  Get WhatYou Want.” Also, Sympathy for the Devil, Paint It Black, Angie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As long as he loses. However historic landslide would put a smile on my face. 😉😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How nice of LeBron. 👍 but I thought voting was a right and not something you should have to pay for.  Rs should be ashamed of themselves. Oh wait, they have no shame. 😡🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha ha 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well duh!!! That’s exactly why we are voting #Trump out. 🙄 Nbody wants his version of America<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right, just like you closely monitored COVID-19? 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hanaghadban1 @politvidchannel @Eddiiiiiiie_ I am sure little rocket man knows better 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, can’t say they’re not acting quickly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s pretty bad when people representing one of the GOP‘s heroes makes such a demand. Reagan Foundation demands Trump and RNC stop raising money off his image: report  https://t.co/wA4i8JpzIJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn’t that something very unusual for Russia? I’m wondering if they are at all influenced by the protests we are having here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Truman but I do not remember him at all. The first president I remember is #Eisenhower BUT #JFK was an idol to me even at a young age. I will always remember like it was yesterday that horrible day in November. 😥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can’t imagine why. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you’re speaking in terms of the election,Cool 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do not wish CoVid19 on anybody, yet I hear of cases like this and I just shake my head. Sometimes I think it’s just best not to say anything yet I hear where you’re coming from 🤷‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s for sure. I can’t happen soon enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone remember when #Trump was running for president, he slammed #Obama for always golfing. 🙄He said if he were president he would not have time for golfing. Oops, another lie 🙄😡 all he does is golf and tweet. He is totally useless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I pray to God Dems DO take WH and both houses. I DO NO recognize #Trumps America. He's taken us to the sewer. You gotta be insane not to see that. 🙄GO DEMS!! Let's really get America back to being great. #Biden2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is him.  https://t.co/9SmrurNyVO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JohnRoberts Has anyone else wondered that IF Rs against voting by mail (especially during this pandemic) went to SCOTUS, IF  Roberts/Rs would side with Rs or Ds or what's fair?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AMJoy.  Who is this asshole that’s defending Trump and spewing all kinds of lies things he’s done?  Talk about head up his a**. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>American Pie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who the hell would believe it? It sounds like an obvious lie typical of 45.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahh, is that all it takes?   Anyone have a bowl of mashed potatoes? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely. He would be perfect.  Constitutional law is his specialty. He would be great. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would love to see that?  👍👌He wouldn’t know what hit him.  😂 we all know he couldn’t handle the truth. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 😂😂😂😂😂LMAO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I didn’t see that particular meeting, but I just love the way she questions/interrogates/conducts herself during these sessions. She is wonderful. When I see these sessions,it makes me think she’d be a fantastic attorney general, even though I’d like to see her as VP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone watching #Rachel? Group of Drs wrote letter suggesting US start all over with shutdown , with ALL states at same time. They claim that the only way to stop this virus. I really think that’s what we will end up having to do or will never get rid of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And, it was reported today that the CDC suggested opening schools with guidelines. I wonder who gave them that idea? Can’t even trust them anymore. And, Trump is the only one that gives the updates now and he’s always so honest, right? 🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The ‘hypocrisy knows no bounds’: Teachers’ union president slams Trump as he cancels GOP convention while urging schools to reopen -  https://t.co/A3pBvPYgod<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For sure. They should put his pic in the dictionary under moron.  A true fit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maddow That is so wrong. We need health experts that report the truth. They’re gonna kill us and nobody gives a f**k? Somebody speak up, be the ppls voice.  Put politics aside for a change😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course, HE is his #1 priority.  Anyone who thinks he really cares about the American ppl, are kidding themselves. Don't believe anything he says.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, I read they closed down all White House Cafeterias due to a worker had covid-19 AND I read that Baron's school would not be opening. Now, WHO is 45 looking out for???? HIMSELF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Btw, I’m waiting for #Fauci to fold next. I can’t help it, I sense that that day is coming. 😡😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmandiOnAir @CDCgov At this point, I think they should leave it to the governors. I have more faith in my governor than I do in the president and all the people in his crooked administration. Dems can’t/won’t do anything...we’re screwed. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmandiOnAir @CDCgov I have no faith in the CDC. It appears they’re folded into their master, #Trump. I hope people are paying attention and seeing this for what it is. It’s so careless and dangerous. Very scary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even if he did, we would never know about it. He would not allow it and nobody would push him on it. He could have it now for all we know. I honestly don’t think anything will change 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this,like the Russians killing our troops story, will die in the wind/nobody will pursue it. 😡Let’s face it this MFer so-called President can, &amp; will continue to do as he pleases with no consequences. After all, all we have to do is vote him out,be damned everything else 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ditto!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1st 45 alone gives updates, NOW CDC “HIGHLY recommends re-opening schools but with caution.” Is anyone else worried that the CDC is kissing #Trumps ass and saying what he wants them to say? Sorry I don’t trust any of them. 😡 #MSNBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yea right! Yet he’s OK with sending kids back to school isn’t he? 🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#TrumpPresser  So, #Birks is outside of the room, and #Fauci isn't invited but we are to believe they briefed #Trump AND that he's giving an accurate account of that briefing? I don't think so! WTAF 🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is #Chuckles still on? WTF does he get so much airtime? Where's #Ari?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope he sends out the Gestapo when the gun clinging 2nd amendment ppl gather to intimidate/show off their guns. Oh wait, probably not. NOTHING stops 2nd amendment. 1st amend., on the other hand.....🤬🤬<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Gross.  😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maddow It won’t matter. This president can do anything he wants and it won’t matter. Now, imagine if Obama did this? 😡See what I mean?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It would be extremely cool. 😉🙏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mahogany1992 They try so hard to convince themselves this guy can be "presidential"😂 It's NOT gonna happen. He's a pathetic moron and a sociopath who doesn't care about anyone but himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So NO experts at this #Covid19 so called update?  What a joke. 🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WTAF was that? Who were those people hitting him? A guy gets beaten in the street and then literally picked up and kicked to the curb and the police leave. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He needs to be shown the way out!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, I saw that. Unbelievable,  well maybe not. I certainly hope something is done about this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, do we know for certain who is going to be there besides Trump, and I would guess Pence?  Who is the expert? Who’s the doctor?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are we wasting multiple tests a day on him, and he won’t shell out to give more tests to the American people? One more example of exactly who Trump is watching out for, himself. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks, because I have no interest in watching his rally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I call bullsh*t. Where/what is your proof??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, we are not doing very well. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My thoughts exactly!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politvidchannel Would not be a surprise at all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hear also that he wants to include tax cuts. WTF 😡Of course our cooked ass President hHas to get something for himself out of it. Every move he makes has to benefit HIM. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait! No #Fauci or any Doctor/Health expert? So we just have to listen to #Trump and his bullshit? Count me out. 🙄😡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I agree with all of the comments suspicious of this “suicide”. It’s not like there’s no reason to even think it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you kidding me? Did we see the same interview? 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good for them. Our freedom of speech must never be taken from us. Great sign by the way. 👍<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I would not expect #Trump to make any comment whatsoever. Don’t we all know by now he really does not care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well put Richard. Right to the point. 👍😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh no!!!😢. I am so sorry to hear that<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@58isthenew40 @SpeakerPelosi @DHSgov Honestly, at this point, I have to wonder exactly what it would take for any kind of action against this president. November is too far away and a lot more damage can be done between now and then. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please do something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kate, i’m watching now and heard it being reported a couple times. I’m just stunned that Democrats aren’t saying anything about this. This is very serious and dangerous if you ask me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What? The House? #Pelosi's house? Or do you mean that they want to extend statutes of limitations in order to be able to prosecute 45 when he leaves??? I'm kind of confused???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha ha that’s all they got? 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh Democrats, where are you? 😡🙄Care to comment?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh yes.  They are really good at that. They prefer to wait until November and until then let the crook in the Oval Office destroy our country. I’m waiting to see if anybody’s gonna speak up but won’t get my hopes up. 😡🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We know that’s all it will take<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree. As much as I want to see Harris as VP, I also think she would make an awesome AG.  I’m sure there’s a place for all of those ladies in this cabinet<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I just do not understand, with the number of cases all over the country of the coronavirus, how these morons can be so pissed off at the idea of wearing a mask to protect others/yourself. It is not political. It is for your own good THEY will kill us all. 😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you kidding me?  🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahhh yes.  I remember it well. What a shocker. 😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You nailed it Mary Jane. Republicans would’ve been publicly outraged and already having hearings regarding Russia killing our troops. Democrats prefer to wait till November and do nothing. 😡🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We don't hear #Trumpster talking much about the polls these days do we? 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Great ad!👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So true and I have serious doubts that he ever will. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You got further than I did I saw his face and I turn the channel. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someone just tweeted that he announced it on Facebook. It must be he can’t get on Twitter. Ha ha ha ha probably killing him. 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Republicans Like to spin the yarn that people are going to get into mailboxes and change peoples  votes 🙄Isn’t it something like only 40% of the population even votes on on the election? Really, how many would bother tracking down ballots and changing votes 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you kidding me? If this is true how can this be legal and why isn’t anybody doing anything about it? By the way, what makes Republicans so sure they’ll lose if ppl vote by mail? Wtf?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonQFrench So is this a joke or is this for real?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Oh yea I remember that tweet and I believe he posted a picture of everybody having a great time without a mask 😷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow!  I’m assuming these are true stories. Makes me cry. 😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bring your cell phone as well so you can post videos. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's the truth. Hey, can't we "the people" insist that we want updates from #Fauci and maybe #Cuomo on a regular basis, or does 45 override that request?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here in California, orange county wants all the students to go back this fall with no obligation to wear masks and no social distancing. If I had a child in that school district I’d be damned if I want them to go to school now let alone unprotected.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JCTRamblerINC @jodotcom @waltb31 Good point, I certainly hope so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know, he’s always so upfront straightforward and honest what could he possibly be hiding. 🙄😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That would be my question but I have a feeling judging from how we’ve gotten to know 45, that he’ll pretty much obstruct until he’s out of office. It seems this president can do whatever whenever he wants. Unless perhaps there’s a backlash and people protest?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man is constant obstruction to releasing these taxes makes me think he’s really got a lot of stuff to hide. I hope somebody makes them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This scares me. Can he do this? I fear he’s not going to release information that the people have a right to know. Is anyone coming forward? Like maybe the CDC will have a right to object?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Of course he knew. Is there any doubt? Thing is, what do we do about it????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I totally believe it. The guy is a total crook who cares only about himself. We all have learned by now not to trust anything he says or does. Always expect a selfish ulterior motive for anything he does. He doesn’t care<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For sure!! 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Milky Way 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He IS a moron. Look it up in the dictionary, you’ll see a picture. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Except for orange county. I hear they’re going to vote shortly to open schools with no safety measures/conditions. I hope that’s not true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blue thankfully<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow! Someone’s getting desperate. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope and pray that states that don't want mail-in voting change their minds OR are forced to by a SCOTUS ruling. If things continue like this how can they NOT?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Fauci  OMG, is anyone surprised at this? Will the faithful sheep still stand behind this dipshit? Isn't it obvious what DT is doing? Watch, now 45 will pick an unqualified person to spin the BS he wants. 🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What? If this is true why doesn’t somebody just get her out of there. I was just waiting for someone to succeed. Gee I wonder who could possibly want her dead?🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Now,  all of a sudden #Trump and the ppl around him are allowed to wear masks?🙄 on the bright side, it does cover up his face. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I always remember that one episode where he was sleeping in the forest and in the background were all the forest animals making a whole bunch of noise He gave that Fonz look, stood up and yelled loudly “COOL IT”.  Then the forest was quiet all the animals stopped ehhhh 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now he speaks up.   https://t.co/EsAyRR3VsE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me either. As a matter of fact the thing I've heard MOST from Dems, in light of all 45 scandals/issues, etc is they can't do anything but "Vote him out in Nov. That's planted in the brain. Until then, 45 can do ANYTHING he wants. 🤬🙄I never realized a Pres had unlimited power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha ha 😂😂😂 I am enjoying some of these comments regarding #SenatorCollins great concern. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know.  I saw him earlier on MSNBC, and as much as I like #Schiff, I don’t expect him or the Democrats to do anything. He suggested what all Dems do.... does vote him out. We can pray that in the next six months our country isn’t totally destroyed. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s not much of a story in the media either<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha!  No doubt I find that very disturbing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha 😂😂😂 I am sure she finds it very disturbing. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🙄🙄🙄 And we know that law will never happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m afraid it’s not gonna happen Joe. The few people I have heard speak on this don’t like it, say they are outraged, but their solution is wait until November and vote him out. Which I hope to do but where do you draw the line? That’s what pisses me off. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You sure??? I’m glad to hear that. I still don’t trust this move. Not sure what he’s up to them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait #Barr installs ally to replace former US AJ attorney for EDNY. Does that mean this person will toss out trumps tax case. 😳Am I correct?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yea yea yea! 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In my opinion it sure doesn’t help that #Stone comes across as a cocky self-centered a-hole. Not the least bit likable. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha ha 😂😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#RogerStone. I don’t expect the Democrats to be outraged or even say much about it. #SteveSchmidt is saying more than any Democrat ever would dare. Remember, our ONLY option is to vote him out until.. then he can do whatever he wants to do with no objection. 🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#RogerStone. Meanwhile Trump’s fixer gets thrown back in jail. G I wonder what’s up with that?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You mean it was a lie?😳 what a shocker.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish. I feared This would happen, once I saw how quickly they dropped coverage of it. It seems Congress/media attitude is wait till November and vote him out. Until then he has full reign to do whatever he pleases. It makes me sick. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just now on #MSNBC, they played a tape of #Trump saying “Fauci is a nice man but made a lot of mistakes.” Omg is Fauci on his way out? The only one that we listen to his doctor Trump? 😡😂WTF<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Exactly! Of course we’re going to vote, but that does not mean to let criminals get away with their crimes. Have hearings meetings impeachments, whatever.

<|startoftext|>#GovernorNewsome. I beg you not to follow #Trumps advice to open schools in September if CA is not safe to do so. I pray the governor has the authority over a president when it comes to something like this. 🙏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The story just died, just like the poor soldiers and 45/congress do NOT care. What has happened to our country?😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would not be surprised at all I have often thought the same thing during this pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope somebody is making sure the cameras by her cell are working and is taking names of who's in the area etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully she left something (statement?) with somebody or documents of some kind with "somebody" and anticipated she may be killed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AND, she'll  supposedly kill herself and #Barr will determine that's that and it'll be done. AND again, NOTHING will be done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Notice how the #RussiaPaidtoKillAmericanTroop story sort of bit the dust??? NOTHING will be done. 🤬NOW, 45 wants schools open. I'm NOT comfortable yet with that. I hope Govs can override douchebag 45.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I agree. I have 3 grandchildren, two are suppose to return next month. I have a daughter who is a kindergarten teacher, who at this point, isn't sure when she'll go back. Yes, I am very very worried. I'm just not satisfied that it is safe. ☹️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That lady is making a total ass of herself. 😡🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was she arrested??  She should be. 😡 Keep RTing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. IF (and I emphasize the if) It’s decided that the taxes must be released. How soon will that happen? Today? Could they limit who actually gets to see the taxes, in order to protect #Trump?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope you're right. IF they agree to NOT release them, I wonder what the reason would be. Every other President has, why should 45 be different? How hard a decision can this be?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SCOTUS I'm hearing that they will make several decisions today and "POSSIBLY" on 45s taxes. Anyone think they'll wait til AFTER the election so it'll benefit #Trump?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I totally agree. I’m torn because I think #KamalaHarris would be great as well. She is actually my first choice. Yet, I think KH would make a great attorney general. We could use her in that role right now too. I’ll be OK with either of them as VP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IMO Republicans deliberately left you out so they could all get their story straight and all more or less have the same “line.” I don’t trust them as far as I could throw.

<|startoftext|>Omg really?  How sickening<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And how would they know IF there child was among this particular group. Also, maybe the military told them a totally other story?????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree. I have wondered where the military is on this. I haven't heard a peep. What about family of the assassinated soldiers? Man, if I were a parent I'd be pissed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's true. Another question: What will it take for the GOP to split from DT?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess my point is, at WHAT point do we say, "hey this is serious; this guy is dangerous; country first?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the other hand, he IS a danger to our country and NOW it seems to our troops.  I think this warrants an investigation, whether or not it's election year or whatever the results prove. IMO all hell could break loose in the next four mos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you think anything will be done about this? It is so serious and yet silence for the most part. Very discouraging.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trumps Booty belongs to #Puuty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@merrittcoach I wonder if there’s anyway of knowing which soldiers were victims of this assassination. Surely their family has the right to know, not to mention we the people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let’s not forget the Democrats are pretty silent too. Heard anything from #Pelosi or #Schumer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YES!  MEDIA you will be complicit if you let this go. Shame on you!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s what I fear. ☹️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TraitorTrump Has #Pelosi, #Scchumer,#Nadler, #MoscowMitch or ANY rep Commented on this? Is there NO outrage here? WTF. I suspect #Pelosi will say “wait til Nov and vote him out.” Until then, 45 can have a field day doing whatever he wants. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg.  I’m with you. When this broke last night I thought all hell would break loose. Although I see it is being reported, I’m disappointed at the lack of coverage it’s getting. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GOP knew as well? They ALL are traitors. They got all up in arms over Benghazi, and are silent for this? They are truly shameful. And shame on ALL our congressional representatives who remain silent and let this go. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lol I am sure she is deeply disturbed. 🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree. I have not seen the outrage from these elected officials that I would have expected. It makes me think perhaps this is just going to go away. I hope the media stays on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Russia denies it. Well, of course it does. After all Russia always tells the truth right? 🙄Has DT, #Barr or anyone commented on this? OR, will it just go away in the summer, like a miracle. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the only story I see on this issue. Basically DT did nothing 😡 Trump administration has refused to respond after learning Russia offered bounties for killing US troops: report  https://t.co/s6QIlObSG8<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Watch, the Dems only comment will be to vote him out in November.  I don’t have high hopes that they’ll do much, sadly 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s what I say. Where are the calls for an investigation? Is this going to be overlooked?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It is trending here on Twitter under #Putin and #TraitorTrump. I agree it is a big story and should be the top story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PutinsPuppet So, will this be the straw that breaks the camels back? Should there not be, let’s say, 125 Benghazi type investigatons on this or do we just let it slide?

<|startoftext|>Wow!  1964 The Animals.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>He did. Insanity runs rabid in this White House/republican party 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will be absolutely fine with it. #Harris is my first choice but #Warren is good too. After what 45 has done to our country, ANY of the ladies contending would be fine with me. 👍If he does not choose Harris as a VP, he better choose her as AG.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmyAthatcher @NotonW Exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, me either. It’s always DT or 45. Can’t quite get the P word out on my mouth when referring to him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What IF this happened? Pence w/b Pres til Jan but who runs against DT in election? Pence? Morning Joe suggests Trump may ‘leave the stage’ rather than suffer 400 electoral vote blowout in November  https://t.co/SrhUdVFG1S<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Covid19Update  #Pence asked about not wearing masks and yet 45 has rallies etc. He's dodging the question pointing out ppl's freedom of speech to gather, etc.  He's NOT doing well IMO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Covid19Update  Don't you just KNOW all these ppl so far, (except maybe #Fauci, were instructed to play it down, praise #Trump? I'd really rather hear #Cuomo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👏👍🙌👌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh yea!!!!  That sounds more believable doesn’t it?  😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe. He has been speaking as tho he’s gonna lose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Covid19Update. I see #Pence walking on eggshells trying to sugarcoat it. He said that 45 once said regarding the virus, “We have one mission...to save lives.” I don’t recall Trump saying that at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it just me or does the fact that #Trump is trying to totally gut the #ACA, especially NOW, a totally idiotic move at this point? A terrible Time to pull people’s health insurance, not to mention shooting himself in the foot politically. 😂Stable genius my a**. 🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Btw, I never quite bought into the idea that #Trump won't leave if elected. Ppl make too big a deal out of it. Carry his ass out if he doesn't leave. BUT, he sure doesn't sound like he'll fight it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds like 45 is conceding already. Cool If #Biden wins (I sure hope so), we can consider ourselves lucking in another respect: We had a mediocre candidate kick 45's a**<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or to quote Mark Twain: “ It is better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt.” 45 removed all doubt a long time ago. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha. So true!! And we all know the fool WILL keep yapping. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow!! How beautiful!!! 👌👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. We know the name is actually ACA, but the Republicans chose to sarcastically call it #ObamaCare. Well, guess what? Ppl like it. 👍 get over it Republicans!! You lost this fight. 👍<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#WeWantJoe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. Well twice in my lifetime the electoral college picked the president and not for people and I don’t trust this president or the Republicans. Anything can happen. BUT as of right now, at this point, it’s looking good for our side. IMO 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes that’s true. We  can’t get overconfident with the polls. However, I must admit I’m thinking Trump will end up burying himself politically without #Biden having to do much. 😂That being said, it’s still a long way to November, anything can happen.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I agree. Wasn't impressed at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was NOT impressed with him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait, expand the authority of the justice department? What? #Barr doesn’t have enough authority already? What does that mean? They’re likely preparing for an impeachment of #Barr &amp; wanna make sure the DOJ has authority to do as it pleases. Is this not suspicious?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Oh wow. What a tremendously sad yet very accurate visual of a disastrous President (and I use that term very very loosely). 😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ambertamblyn @JoyAnnReid Oh good. I see she’s been taking that time slot lately. Good choice. I wonder if she’ll  still have her weekend show?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can I hear a loud MOOOO! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha ha 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh I know. Don’t get your hopes up. They’ll keep stalling until after the election, especially if the Democrats win, then won’t pursue it any further.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well I hope so, but when he says “May impeach”, I try not to get too hopeful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait. What are they ruling on tomorrow?  Is it DTs taxes?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So true. He is proving he does NOT care about the American people. 🤬He thinks he can just wish away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this something that should be "normal?" Isn't it a cruel uncaring and illegitimate move by a President? I suppose, because it's #Trump, he can do as he pleases and suffer NO consequences, right? 🤬🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right!  I’ll believe it when I see it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Oh NOW he’s worried. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OK, I read that they got an order from a judge to open the doors and allow voting for 30 more minutes. If the people that were waiting in line we’re in line at closing time all of them should get to vote right? What if it takes more than 30 minutes? Why the time limit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m kind of confused on what she is talking about<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very nice.  He has so many great songs. Few other favorites are, The First Cut is the Deepest, Forever Young, Motown Song,  oh and I love Young Turks. I could go on and on. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha. Kudos Steve. 👍👌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know, that’s always my first thought when I see a name trending. I love Rod Stewart and am glad my first thought wasn’t correct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>EXACTLY!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good.  I really think they did that so people would get tired of waiting and go home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great!   That’s one way to start fresh and get all new people and train them correctly. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good!!!! 👍Congratulations AOC.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I know, I just commented. I mean wtf. 😉<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>👎 it’s past time tto eliminate it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He sure is. I’m telling you, when (if)he loses the election it won’t just be our country that celebrating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Godfather 1 &amp; 2, Ghost, Bourne series, Dark Knight. Though it’s been decades, I know I watched the Wizard of Oz for years when I was a kid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She is fantastic.She’s really impressed me ever since I saw her question #Kavanaugh. 👍👌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey SFB, another great nickname for him. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love her. She’s smart, she is informed,she’s brave;she is great In this kind of form. She would make a great VP or president, but damn she be a really good attorney general as well. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. It’s just a bunch of paper shuffling that nobody’s going to do jack shit about. By now we all know the song and dance. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yup!! 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that is so nice.  What a wonderful gesture. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmmm I wonder what’s going on. Maybe #Trump is having a meltdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I imagine he’ll defy the subpoena and it’ll go to SCOTUS, In which case it’ll be months before we even know, likely after the election. Plus we got a right wing Scotus so I wouldn’t get my hopes up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me.  It’s very easy and I have complete confidence in it It. I’ve never had a problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can imagine that if #Biden wins there will be many other countries celebrating with America. 🙏🏻👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like her. 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I am so glad to hear that.  👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If by harassment, you mean an honest negative critique; anger at decisions he’s made or things he said; Outrage over how he’s destroying our country; then hell yeah, harass away. He EARNED it. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No surprise. He is the worst president ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ditto!  I saw the headline and I thought the same thing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Kudos to your son. I’m telling you the Zoomers are impressing me.  I have a 13-year-old grandson I’ll have to ask him if he knows about this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey that should be his official presidential portrait they hang in the White House. He would love that. 😂 it actually him fits perfectly. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We wouldn’t want to do that right? 😉RT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree with you, but how many times have we heard the only way to get rid of 45 is to “vote him out.” 🙄 so, he can do anything he does in the next 6 mos?😡AND, What if he does not lose in November? A big “Oh well” 🤷‍♀️? 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree. Trump should be impeached as well (again). I know the Republicans do not care about the rule of law, but let’s get  sworn testimony on record.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ll believe it when I see it. My guess, absolutely nothing will be done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly!  Wtf 😡This has to be taken care of before the election. It sure as hell sounds like a deliberate attempt to fix votes for the Republican party, by making it difficult forAAs to vote. How can this even NOT look like an obvious greedy ploy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“Major Failure” describes his entire presidency. 👎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a good look that’s for sure. 👎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wouldn't complain at all but not likely to happen. BUT, #PBO would be a great Supreme Court Justice. I mean, constitutional law is his specialty....doesn't get any better. I'd LOVE to see that happen.  😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What in the hell is their reason for doing this? What do they SAY the reason is? This makes me sick. Yes, it's voter suppression AND racism. Can't anyone do something? 🤬🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, i’ve never seen him look so frumpy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>“Emptysburgh Address” 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, Is he the one who put this rally together?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are they going to say who though staffers are?  I read that two of them were secret service agents. All the people that saw six people have been in contact with have also been expose then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well they look like they’re really enjoying themselves 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you know what I would love to see and I think will actually happen? When #PBO starts campaigning with #Biden, I have no doubt he will bring in the crowds and I hope their packed stadiums. Of course,  it all depends on the coronavirus status tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha. Can you keep running that by us again and again? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because you know, freedom of the press doesn’t apply anymore. 😡🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Is that really what happened? That’s hilarious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad!!! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, it looks like some of them or not have a hard time keeping a social distance since crowds are so small. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now, don’t you guys go retweeting this, it might piss off #Trump 😉 ‘Pitiful turnout’: Trump mocked for ‘hilariously weak’ attendance at Tulsa rally held during coronavirus pandemic  https://t.co/O9yUChaQcD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why don’t the representatives in Kentucky open their damn mouth let the people know how to getting screwed and get something done?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MSNBC reported 45 said he canceled because of the protesters bothering the Kool-Aid klan. 🙄 Trump scraps outdoor speech due to low attendance  https://t.co/m2NH1epCA4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And don’t you know it’s gonna piss 45 off. Or, maybe not you could just lie and say they were 1 million people there, forget whether it’s possible or not he could do it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Then #Trump won't allow any testimony and that will be that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They said earlier he was a Republican and a Trump supporter he donated to the Trump campaign. So yes I’m guessing he was easily swayed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who exactly is #Strauss?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Little by little he’s getting all his loyalists all in position to protect him, and nobody does Jack shit. 😡 God knows how much further in the dumpster he’s going to take us in the next six months. Oh well, we wait and vote him out right? 🙄😡 until then he does as he pleases.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I knew it. We won’t hear from him anymore. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course it will implicate Trump. He couldn’t care less about any of the other people, it’s always about him. He’s trying to save his own ass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hear that #Berman is a Republican and donated to the Trump campaign. Let’s not get our hopes up too much. He might just cave like everybody else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully they won’t cover most of it. I’ll tell you this much I have no plans whatsoever to watch. I’d rather watch paint dry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, yes but Trump just said that’s an hour ago he was an involved in it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A**wipes are too stupid to even get their stories straight. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m just as confused. Sadly, I don’t think anything will be done about this. I think 45 can do as he pleases. And of course the Republicans are to blame but I curse both parties right now. This just does not seem right. 😡DO SOMETHING!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I heard that as well but just a few minutes ago they said #Trump fired him in appointed temporary attorney. And, I hear the president is the only one who CAN fire him. So what’s the truth? I’m thinking the truth is whatever 45 wants to do he can do without question. 😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait! First #Barr fires him by saying he resigned but he refuses to resign. Then I hear that only the president can fire him. Next thing I hear is #Trump fired him. But just now I hearTrump himself is saying he wasnt involved in it right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we will get the same old song and dance. Nobody’s gonna do nothing because we can “vote him out.”I’m getting so sick of that phrase. He can break the law and do whatever the f**k he wants until November and then we forget everything he did right?😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So per #PeteWilliapms according to law, #Trump DOES have the authority to fire #Berman?  The deputy State Attorney will be "acting" state attorney. Wow, all other supposed experts today indicated that was not the case. #MSNBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hell no!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SethAbramson How is this even legal???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And so it begins. To the people attending know this? I guess the better question is, do they care????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AriBerman How is this even legal? How can I get away with this? 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm guessing it's per #Trump orders that nobody who is a protester and/or anyone NOT proTrump should be admitted. Wrong yes, but exactly something 45 would do. And no chickensh*ts around him will say anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well listening further, that’s exactly why she got removed. You’re right, what happened to freedom of speech? In what world could you not go to any presidential rally and protest peacefully or wear a T-shirt like that? What the hell have we become as a country? 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The charge is trespassing, Ben tho she had a ticket? 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, so true. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, because of her T-shirt she got removed from the rally. She said she had a ticket why didn’t the cops just asked to see her ticket stub? I don’t get it. Since win can’t you protest at any presidential rally/event? That’s so messed up.  😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, A woman with a “ I can’t breathe” Tshirt, sitting quietly sitting on ground protesting;said she had a ticket to #TrumpRally yet gets forcibly removed. I must say I’m confused as to why she was removed? 🤔Her name is #SheilaBuck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just heard that #Berman is a #Trump supporter so I won't get my hopes up.  He may fold in the end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree. This GOP has proven to be the worst ever. I'm guessing in the end, the entire party has to reconstruct themselves. Certainly they are NOT the Grand Old Party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BREAKING this is an interesting twist. Somebody’s in a hurry to have this guy resign  ‘I have not resigned’: SDNY US Attorney denies DOJ announcement he was ‘stepping down’ -  https://t.co/uJx9LyoOsJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m kind of hoping for #Harris. Although I don’t know a lot about her I do like #Demings. If he chooses her hair is better be AG. She’d be great in that position also. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/rl9cIRXnOn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It sure does. I hope something can be done about it or that this can at least be investigated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m so sorry to hear about your mom Lilith. I agree, it definitely is not a joke I hope your words get thru to some of the people who refuse or deny, or just don’t wanna hear the truth. My sympathies to you. 😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s petrifying. There should be a bigger deal made out of this. Plus, he just fired the Southern District of New York attorney. According to Rachel, Bolton wrote in his book that Trump wanted to replace attorneys that might be handling his cases, or something to that effect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump just fired Attorney for SDNY and is assigning somebody else. #Ravhel says that #Boltons book said that 45 wanted to get rid of any attorneys that will handle his cases. WTF?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. That is so scary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He got fired because he raise the alarm about COVID-19 on the ship? That’s the reason?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👍👌 good job. Keep it up!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great ad. Can you think about it, #Trump makes it easy for his opponent to make an ad. Just record him at any given time and he’s basically burying himself. 😉👌👍👏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KwikWarren I am for #Harris BUT #Rice does have the experience and I think she would be great also. I like #Abrams But I think she needs a little more experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well then....By all means, it’s every state mail-in ballots. Woo hoo!!!!👍👌👏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. I could not believe it when I heard it. How the hell can we even take any Supreme Court seriously anymore? I wonder about SCOTUS even more now that I see Oklahoma Supreme Court is right up 45s  a**. Politics over people. How pathetic. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not only that, but today the state Supreme Court ruled that attendees and people at the rallies did not have to take precautions. Even the state supreme court plays favoritesHow much more political can you get? 😡🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes I agree. It’s different this time. Their asses are in a sling. They are desperate. I say get some new batches of new recruits get rid of all the ones that walk out and start new police forces without Black ppl killers. Long overdue.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Think about it. #Trumps ego....people lining up to adore and to die for him. The epitome of adoration.  He lives for that.    🤬🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TrumpRally So, the Oklahoma Supreme Court denied request to enforce safety requirements at Trump rally. I’m in the middle of a pandemic, crowds of people gathering and side in one place, who needs safety requirements right?😡🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, We could be heading for no more freedom of the press? We only hear what they want us to hear??🤔Gee, and they don’t like our freedom of speech/protest either do they? But second amendment/guns....it’s anytime,anywhere,for any purpose, by anybody?😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God I hope so. 🙏🏻👍🤞👌 that would be a well deserved wipe out. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yea, that’s the video I remember. Two little kids happy to see each other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He certainly seems to be deteriorating rapidly. Maybe he’s looking for an out?? And there are those who fear if he loses he won’t leave. Do you really think he’d wanna stay? That’s his out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“ and then like a miracle, he’ll be gone.” 😂🙏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God I hope you’re right. 🙏🏻🤞👍👌 I am not crazy about #Pence but I can take him for a couple months way easier than 45. Btw, say that does happen, who does #Biden run against in the election, would it be #Pence?Or can anyone hop up and join in?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh no! How scary!  I hope he heals soon. 🙏🏻<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>God knows there’s plenty to investigate for another impeachment. However I have no faith that the Democrats will even try and the Republicans just don’t care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, so now what? We know the song and dance. We keep hearing that the only way to get rid of him is vote him out. Until then he can do whatever he wants. They’re not gonna do jack shit. 🙄 What if he doesn’t lose? Oh well! 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly, I believe you can. How can they put a limit on it if the president keeps committing impeachable offenses. That being said, I have a little faith that they will, but if they were to investigate, can you imagine what they’d find? Historic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is no limit to their stupidity. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KateWestRN I look forward to it, if it does happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KateWestRN Well that sounds really encouraging. 👍 I hope it proves to be the solution, sooner rather than later.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I believe it is. However, I think even after the election when/if he loses, I’ll bet both Democrats and Republicans just let it go. They will let every illegal thing he did go. I can’t see #Biden doing anything about it. Certainly deserves an investigation at least.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know I never watch him or #AndreaMitchell. I turn the station. However now right after Mitchell #CTodd comes on for an hour and a half. 🙄😡 Then he’s on again at 2:00 (PST)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Our president should not be allowed to commit a federal crime. You tell him #SenatorHarris. 👍👌😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was just gonna tweet that I hope somebody took a picture of him with the mask on. Feel free to retweet it, we know he doesn’t like it. Makes him look weak right? 😉😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, I would be good with her too she’s great. A lot of great women<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My choice is #Harris or #Warren but I am perfectly fine with #Klobachur as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many of us look very forward to what you have to say. Please do it before the election. Oh, and by the way stay safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He’s trying to make an excuse for himself because he will be voting by mail. We know who he’s going to vote for. Bottom line, he knows he’ll lose if mail in voting prevails. All states should do it to avoid Russia interference. Another reason why Trump doesn’t want it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hu?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha. I just can’t see him bowing out gracefully. He would probably say it was a hoax; or #Biden/Dems was being mean to him; or blame mail-in voting. He would be better off keeping his mouth shut but we know that’s not a possibility.  😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Rachel. Is anybody watching? Story regarding the meat packers?Per Gov.,workers can’t be told if there’s an outbreak in their plant until 10% of the workers get it? I have a feeling we’re going to get a resurgence of COVID-19 big-time. #Trump lies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Rachel reporting that the Iowa GOV will NOT allow meat plant workers to know if there is another outbreak at their plant until the number of cases is 10% of the employees. WTAF?  Seriously, when do people get upset? When do we kick this asshole out? WTF will it take? 😡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ditto!! Pure bullsh*t!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmmm, I wonder why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually, I given up on them. They are either totally ignorant, willfully blind or totally coldhearted and don’t care about our country. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is wrong with you? We’ve been doing it here in California for a long time and have had no problems. What are you afraid of? Losing, which hopefully you will. You’d rather everybody gets sick and die from a virus then vote safely 😡 Worst presidents ever!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg. Shithead is putting it to mildly. 😡😡 we have had mail in voting here for so long and there’s never been any news of voter fraud. I hear that #KHarris is suggesting drive-through voting, where you can turn in your ballot as your drive-through, showing ID or whatever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just waking up here. I heard on #MSNBC (#SRhule show) a guest say that 45 won't help fund unemployment right now BUT wants another tax cut?? WTF😡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Really? Wow! That is fantastic. How do they do that? I bet you they also have good insurance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jealous much? 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this is probably further proof that we can’t trust any of the polls show #Trump ahead. Who knows, #Biden is probably way more ahead than we think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And who’s surprised? The thing is: is in jail serving time, and 45 he’s so miserablyand failingly running our country. Imagine once again, if PBO did this?? Rs would be screaming for an investigation/lock up.  Media, once again where are you? 🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ha ha. That’s great!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well will have to bombard Twitter with #Obamacommencement speech. Of course that’s going to be easy we know that’s going to happen. 45s probably going to throw a campaign rally and all his loyalists lap dogs will show up<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I don’t know who is either but big kudos to him. 👍👋🖐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha. Hey, that’s all it takes to get #Trump’s panties in a bunch.😂 he is so jealous of President Obama. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see #Trumpgate is alive and well. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ObamaCommencement2020 Think of how historic this speech will be. The first time in our lifetimes we’ve had anything like this pandemic.  Graduations are totally shut down, and our last great president is going to be the keynote speaker. History will remember this. 👍<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Well said. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am with you. I can’t get my hopes up because I don’t have that much faith in the supreme court, even though this appears to be a cut and dry case to release the taxes if you ask me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TrumpTaxReturns  IMO it would seem Trump has no grounds to stop his tax return From being released, however I don’t have a lot of confidence in the supreme court. Being sad if the court rules against 45, will the taxes be released immediately or more red tape/delay?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha ha ha ha 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Because as we have learned #Trump thinks and cares only about himself.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Absolutely. I’ve been saying that for a long time. The Republicans are just as responsible for our country going downhill. They are definitely the swamp. 😡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I have to admit that did cross my mind. Am I bad?🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve been wondering if was the case. Seriously though, does anyone even expect that Trump/Republicans would even let the public be aware of it? Trump could have it himself and he wouldn’t say anything. 😡He does not care about us.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hell yea,he’s jealous. He knows he will never be a fraction of the man that #PBO is. He cannot stand how well liked Obama. That’s why he’s trying to undo everything Obama did. It’s so obvious. He’s poor at hiding it. 🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You’ll get absolutely no argument from me. He is the worst, the very bottom of the barrel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He should be ripped for it. However, my question is, does he have the authority to do that? I would think that would be impeachable, endangering all Americans. He seems to be able to do whatever he pleases with no reprimand whatsoever. He totally sucks!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes. It sure is very damning to the president. I sure hope the media reports it that way. We can’t trust anything this administration says, because he just wants it over with and will lie. We all know that. 😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone listening to comments  by #DrRickBright, the Doctor ousted from team #Trump? Says was political and he was told to ignore certain "things."  I HOPE ppl are listening<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>😂 Well, I have a special affection for #JFK And normally might quibble 😉BUT I get your drift. IF #Biden is guilty of this assault but #Trump guilty of multiple assaults along with being nuts, I’d still vote #Biden. Then again, breaking up the Beatles! 😉😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She did?  Hmmmm I wonder why? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, I did NOT know she was sister of Erik Prince. Hmmm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnitaWade104 Me too!!!! 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this true? Then WTF? OK, she is less and less credible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a crook!  Slimeball! 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That would not surprise me at all if #Trump intervened. I read however, and I think it was on Yahoo, (at the very bottom of the story)an update saying he ‘d be getting out at the end of the month.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perhaps he could have a few pink streaks in his hair to blend together with the cuffs. Wouldn’t that be adorable? And maybe a little pink bow in his hair. 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>For sure. 👌<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kharly You’d  think when both people who are running for the 2020 presidency, the media/public should insist and harp and bug both men to release ALL relevant records. #Trump never complies. I’d say  jump on his ass also. He’s got way more accusations then #Biden. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I tend to agree. He kept saying that a complaint like that would not be in those records. It may be true, but have a legal team go through and see if there’s anything regarding this incident. 🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Nothing fishy there right? 🙄😡 is there anyone who can override the state supreme court judge?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, I thought only the people who receive payments via check would get a letter. I got the direct deposit couple weeks ago and a letter a few days ago, which I promptly shredded with glee. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this even legal for a president/White House to do? Make money from something like this? Unethical at least. Of course we can’t expect anything to be done about it because 45 can do what he pleases. 😡 good to know for next Democratic president. Republicans can’t say shit!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yea people like YOU and the Republicans. You can't pass it off to anyone else<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My guess is he thinks the mask would make him look weak. Ha ha! As if he hasn't proved that already without a mask. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually it sure would be a good time to talk some kind of universal/Medicare for all insurance plans. I don’t care what you call it but something that keeps everybody insured that doesn’t force you to everything you have to pay for it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I’d say the latter. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have no doubt that Trump advised him NOT to wear a mask. Anything to downplay the seriousness of this virus. By the way, has 45 ever gone to this or any clinic? I hear he’s a Germ a phob. Can’t imagine he’d ever go. Too chicken.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DeBlasio. I don’t know that I blame him. My ex, my children’s father, passed away a few weeks ago and they can’t have any kind of service/funeral right now for him. It makes me sad, 😢but I think it’s for the peoples best interest that they do this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I don’t mind at all watching Trump bury himself politically, but not at the expense of  hard-working people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly! What kind of a stupid ass move is that? I'm stunned. I only saw the banner on #MSNBC breaking the story I haven't heard it discussed yet tho. I think DT is gonna have one of his ego pressers soon tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kemet2000 Yes, I just walked in the house and turned on the TV and that was the Breaking news banner. It sounds unbelievably dangerous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just saw breaking news that #Trump was ordering meat plant workers back to work. Evidently, the Gov has 45 backing him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG! Really?  😲IF the Governor has the authority to force them back to work then the families of those who get infected should easily be able to sue him and hold his ass responsible. 😡  https://t.co/fW075LNxOb<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Absolutely. And shame on the Republicans and all the people that are kissing his ass realizing this guy is an ignorant narcissist that he’s extremely dangerous, yet they do nothing 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s what is so scary, not knowing if you have a flu or Covid19. Do you know or have you been around anybody that has it? As I understand it testing is nearly impossible, maybe you should go to your doctor. I hope everything is OK. Take care 🙏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He’s like a little kid. He loves things that go vroom vroom...planes,tanks. 🙄And if he gets kudos for it he’s thrilled. A total narcissist. Everything he does is for his own satisfaction/pleasure. That’s all he cares about. 😡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Her credibility is shot. I could see this coming a while back. He’s fallen under his control/spell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree. NOBODY dares to speak up OR perhaps it is a time in our history where every single Republican does not care about the people in our country enough to speak out. There used to be at least a few decent Republicans, but not any longer. ☹️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>No. It’s too early as far as I’m concerned.  I am surely not convinced it’s safe yet at this point.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's NOT gonna happen. I am so pleased with how he's handling the #CoronaVirus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No I didn't but I'm so glad GOP lost lawsuit. Although the fact that they had the lawsuit isn't surprising. Desperate POSs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did.  Cali<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My first choice also. 👍I am hoping #Biden only serves one term, then a female vice president can be ready to run next term 😉It’s time to give a qualified woman a chance to run our country!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know I would be disappointed if he doesn’t choose a woman. There’s several that will do well. Tho I’m gonna vote for him, I can’t say I’m excited. However, adding a great woman to the ticket, like Harris or Warren would help.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>👍👌🤞🙏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please anyone who can give a definite answer on this. I hear it's in the constitution that he can NOT. Can anyone in the know clarify? God, I hope he can't overrule a Gov or we're all dead. Trump claims he can overrule states on shutdowns  https://t.co/JtgYlo4HKo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No it’s not? I received my tax refund from both state and federal for 2019. They were deposited in my bank account in February this would be, for me,  extra. Much needed, mind you but not the same as my refund.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good idea but #Fauci could also be at #GovernorComo‘s daily briefings. I think more people would be listening to that. I know I tune in nearly every day preferring him over 45s ego show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes!!!! He only wants people around him that I agree with him and will do what he wants. That is what is scary, if you get only unqualified lap dogs making serious decisions. 😳😡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha ha 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha. Yes and they’re doing so well with the testing. How in the hell are they going to test everyone in the United States?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Btw, I also heard for those who are going to receive checks in the mail, it could be a couple months before they get it as opposed to those who have direct deposit with the IRS or Social Security etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope. Last I heard they’re supposed to start distributing them on the 13th. We will see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, I’m so shocked! 😳   😂😂 that certainly would explain why he’s refusing to reveal them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg who the F**k talks like that. 🙄 what a complete idiot. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG 😳 Mr. Stable Genius 🙄 Moron!!! ‘You can’t even get Christianity right’: Trump mocked for offensive ‘Happy Good Friday’ wishes exposing his ignorance  https://t.co/jKAZWdEnQO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg. Don’t you know it. All hell would break loose.  This  inept, selfish, uncaring POS  does not care about anyone or anything except money and himself.  A decent president like #PBO gets treated like sh*t while this scum destroys our country and people are mute😡😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like all of 45 and his men, it all comes down to money and themselves.  Their rich buddies are not getting richer and 45 is embarrassed that he doesn’t know how they handled the situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndruewJamess @SenatorTimScott @GOP It’s to the point where I just read something like that and chuckled to myself because I know it’s bullshit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. GOP would never give an honest answer if you were to ask why the Democrats didn’t fall in line. It’s at the point now where are you just know Republicans are lying. Sad but true. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too. #GovernorNewsom said it would be very likely that schools would not open until September. He’s doing the right thing taking the cautious route. I think 45 doesn’t have the power to overrule the governor as far as this virus goes. Thank God 🙏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s pretty damn sad when we have to worry that the Republicans won’t even face the truth and will blindly follow Mr. stable genius as he leads us to ruin. 😡Normally, both parties would be on top of this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I fear that the #Trump administration, itching to get rid of this virus, will rush to say it’s OK to resume life as normal. I prefer to listen to my governor. I have no trust in 45 at all. I hope people catch him once and for all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is getting pretty scary. Hell yes they’re hiding something.  Ordering health officials not to discuss this on TV when I major pandemic is going on? I hope somebody has the balls to fight this even if it means going to the supreme court. Public hears only what 45 wants. WTF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course they are there must be something that the public would not want to hear or see. I am sure they’re protecting Trump in some form.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know that expression “I don’t have to be run over by a truck?“ Maybe some are finally catching on.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I can understand your sentiment Gretchen, and God bless you for being so brave. Can I ask if you know, where there a lot of people voting first of all. Also did these people generally feel as you do as far as being forced to go out and vote instead of mail-in?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ienscap Ah yes, that's the "Leave the gun; take the cannoli" scene. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coppolawine  Was there once a number of years ago. Very nice. 👍 I had never experienced wine tasting but it was fun. Being a huge GF fan, I even got to take of picture of Vito Corleone's desk that was on display.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Or an episode of #TheTwilightZone where we all find out we are here “To Serve Trump.” OMG 😱 what a horror. 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm guessing he's got stock in it and/or is profiting from pushing for it in some way. EVERYTHING he does is for himself!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well duh!!!!! It is so obvious. You can tell every time he opens his mouth. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheLightattheendoftheTunnel so, what happens when #Trump fires #Fauci and there is no doctor he is relying on for info? We just let him fly by the seat of his pants with our lives?😡 what the hell has to happen before our country wakes the f**k up?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes!!!! 🙏🏻🤞<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fred_guttenberg @Momqueen95 @senatemajldr @JoeBiden If only that would happen. Blame the Republican majority because all it would take is a significant number to speak the hell up, and we know the Democrats would agree. Rs continue to kiss a** at all costs. 😡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#PeterNavarro it would be nice if some real doctors stepped up to defend and agree with #Fauci.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And where is the republican party on this? Has anybody publicly agreed with 46s stance on this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am guessing that any time now #Fauci Will be given his walking papers. Then what? No qualified person there to OK medical treatment for coronavirus? 45 is totally in charge of screwing us all over and killing us?😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I swear,#Trump just wants this to be over so much that he’s willing to play doctor along with his cast of clowns claiming to have a cure, that a real doctor doesn’t support. He only cares about himself!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I would be fine with that as well as mail-in voting. These are the times we are living in......at least for now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bull!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IMHO Way too much is made of this. OK, he probably would hate the idea of stepping down. If another president is elected and if it’s necessary have White House police/authorities come and carry his fat ass out. Not an issue AND the embarrassment would be totally on him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh my. I am very concerned and I find it very disturbing. 😂🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They should record it and view it. And afterwards cut out/edit all the bullshit. Two benefits; we don’t have to hear all his Babble/lies, and it’ll really shorten the press conference. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He’s so on the up and up isn’t he? 🙄😡A-hole. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would have to help.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>They do?  How much were they? Do you need a new mask every time you go somewhere? I imagine you can’t use the same mask too many times.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Oh no!!! 😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@100Concerned @justinamash He's a crook just like 45<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump now saying States were not prepared for this. He also accused another female reporter of being nasty for asking a question. When she said “but you didn’t answer it.” He said, “ it was a perfect answer and you know it.”🙄😡 he is so f**kn’ out of his league. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course. Everything he says is bullshit. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump blaming lack of supplies on the “ previous administration.” 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes! Yes! Yes! 🙏🏻🤞👌🖐Adios! Arrivederci! Farewell. Don’t let the door hit you in the a** on the way out. Best news I’ve heard all week. He probably knows he’s going down in the next election<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BillWithers  I’m so sorry to hear that. I really liked his very distinctive pleasant voice. RIP 😢<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TearsInHeaven09 Absolutely I totally agree. I keep saying #Trump’s bottom line is always himself and/or money. What’s in it for him is all that matters to him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have suspected for a long time that he’s nowhere near as rich as he pretends to be. I wouldn’t be shocked if that were true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why? I’ll bet he ends up getting canned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God, I hope so. 🤞🙏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cherokeesher2 Our “stable genius”.  🙄But didn’t you hear, at least he’s #1 on Facebook. 🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#COVID19Pandemic It is pretty damn sad when a doctor has to determine who lives and who dies by having to choose who gets a respirator. Basically, this is an old person, or this person is going to die anyway so give it to somebody else.  😡😢Is this really what we have become?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a great thoughtful idea. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, and #Trump announced yesterday that he was #1 on Facebook. 🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m telling you, I wondered from the beginning with his supposed “lead” in polls, if he was not rigging them. This kind of confirms it to me. I will hesitate to believe all polls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another words it’s like a ghost town hu? 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha 😂😂 Yea, that’s pretty empty. 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Exactly. I hope we end up doing that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought I read that he couldn’t do the postponement, it’s never been done. Hopefully that’s true, because yes if things  get worse, he’s not gonna want to have the election. But why the hell should I be up to him? If that happens I will be pissed. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Katewes18368539 Boy, ain’t that the truth. He still doesn’t seem in any huge hurry to help people and states. He’s totally worthless. 😡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Your question, yes of course. 😂😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I guess we shouldn’t be surprised. This is the same idiot who thinks he deserves a Nobel peace prize. Dear God, and he’s leading (supposedly) our country?😡😳☹️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lol. Pretty sad when you can’t even tell, because you know it’s possible they can actually be that dumb. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not to sound dumb, but that is a joke right? It’s not really a Maga right? 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Trump ego stroker. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lol same here. Don’t we know that 45 had to put his name on it? Again, for his ego. Trashed mine too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m guessing she finds it a bit troubling but not quite concerned yet. 🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait! How the hell cam he do that? Wtf political ads are always critical. It sure as hell better not happen in our country is going down the sh*t hole. 45 is going to have to put his big boy pants on and face it. 🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha. Oh yes, don’t we all just know how close he is to the Asian Americans? 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They should make it a duel conference.  If they insist on having #Trump, they should also have #Cuomo and have the two of them go face-to-face and discuss it. Gee, I wonder who would sound more knowledgeable/believable? 🤔😉<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>While It wasn’t smart for any of those teenagers to be out partying, I wouldn’t be too hard on this boy. You can bet he’s not gonna do it again.Didn’t we all have that kind of attitude to some degree when we were younger? Party first type thing. 😉<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChrisMurphyCT I would like to know who<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think he wants it over as soon as possible because he knows he’s in a mess he doesn’t know how to get out of. He thinks that’ll do it. Easter, probably a ploy to appeal to his base. You know, make it seem as though he’s religious and cares.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, they only got so much to work with 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can’t say I didn’t see this coming.  Trump aides say he’s starting to lose his patience with Dr. Anthony Fauci  https://t.co/nkqXCqfCSI via @YahooNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ain’t that the truth 😂 Chris Cuomo Warns Media: Anthony Fauci Is Facing Something Worse Than Coronavirus  https://t.co/2w0yOKJRzh via @YahooNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quid pro quo??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just heard about an hour ago also on MSNBC how highly rated his press conferences have been. Really? He’s getting trashed left and right. And now polls come out saying how great he is?Smells fishy to me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ll go with number three. My guess is it’s bought and paid for Poll. I can’t buy it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thus the ‘alternate reality’ job approval poll? 🙄 Damning timeline shows the White House is creating an ‘alternate reality’ where Trump is a competent leader: conservative columnist  https://t.co/sbTZrP4OMi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And yet they say polls show 45 with a 60% approval of handling this crisis. 🙄😡 WHO did they poll?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just now on #MSNBC, #AMitchell, they’re saying how he is even getting support from the Democrats as to how he’s handling this crisis 😳 WTAF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How many people did they poll and or from where?In a time of crisis like we’ve never experienced before, with a president who took his time responding and wants it to be over with by Easter, I find it laughable. Would anyone be surprised if 45 paid for these results?Not buying it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>EXACTLY. Just tweeted about this. I refuse to believe it. At this rate, if he shoot someone on fifth Avenue it’ll probably go up to 100%. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AMitchell reporting that 45 approval rating is in the 60s as to how he’s handling this crisis? Gotta be f**king kidding me. Sorry, I simply am not buying these polls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The more I hear these polls, the more I am beginning to doubt them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope you’re right. It’s way too soon. Even if it did open I wonder how the attendance would be. I don’t think anybody I know would even think of going there right now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do not know if that’s true or not, however, nothing he does with surprise me. He is that kind of person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am really shocked it would open so soon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really??? Am I the only one that doesn’t feel comfortable with that? Surprised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No sh*t!!!!  Well said Meta!!👍👌🖐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am seriously beginning to doubt these polls. I would not be surprised in the least if they are rigged. Think about it, this is just what 45 wants to hear especially at this time. An ego booster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Way better looking. 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is that for real or a joke?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope you’re right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That would be great if he went on with #Cuomo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, The woman, and I can’t think of her name, always seems like she’s kind of kissing up to 45.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t know if I’d go that far, but I have to say say, after today’s presser oh I got the impression that he was being a little more complacent to 45. I wasn’t going to say anything either but I see I’m not the only one who thought that. Hope I’m wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s probably the safest way to go, right? It will avoid any disappointment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boy that’s the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha 😂. I can imagine. So, what really happens when a rabbi a doctor and a lawyer walk into a bar...... we know there’s a joke there somewhere. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The last couple days I’ve heard $1500 and also $1200. Probably safest to assume would be the lower amount. Anything helps though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone know the amount they set? Was it $1200?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just heard this evening on MSNBC that yes you will. I’m not sure what the process will be I thought they said something about filing taxes. Sorry I don’t know the details but I did hear that you will get a check.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As if he really cares? 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, I missed the most of presser so far, did 45 put everything on the Governors??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TrumpPresser  They are really pushing this "15 day isolation" aren't they. 45 wants it to be over by Easter. I sure hope Governors don't comply. I don't see it ending that soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeanObeidallah GREAT Hastag #NotDyingForWallStreet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which is exactly why he wants to end the shut down. Remember, EVERYTHING he does, every decision he makes is to benefit him, either monetarily or egotistically. He cares about nothing else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously, I’m wondering if these polls ar real. He could very likely do his own polls with all his adorers. The more that happens the more I’m having a hard time buying that the percentage is anywhere near that high. Remember he always lies and makes up stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There has never been a president worse than the one we have now. I’ll be so glad when this reign of terror is over<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha ha 😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And no wonder 45 doesn't want unemployment numbers released. ‘This chart, holy sh*t’: Analysis shows more workers filed for unemployment last week than any other in US history  https://t.co/lFQ92NT0JV<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Blabbing at a presser on a Monday afternoon I hope his bullshit sealed his fate.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t we all know he’s definitely going to at least try to get something for himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well he’s an old person to. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that’s exactly what he is doing. He wants to get rid of it and concentrate on the election, true. However, he doesn’t know what the hell he’s doing and or what to do which is why he’s passing it on. Moron!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh wow.  This virus is still so new we are just learning about it.  It will not be business as usual in a week or two I don’t care what 45 says<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh then, that makes me feel a lot better.  No worries🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No thanks. I’d rather watch #Cuomos updates. He doesn’t lie.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Fortunately not long enough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He sure does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ditto!!! 🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#whitehousePressconference  Does anyone know, if #Trump "opens" the country claiming we're safe, can a Governor of any state still keep the lockdown?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NoFauci. I wouldn’t be surprised if Trump fired him because he told him would he didn’t wanna hear. 45 seems set on that 15 day lock down. He should not have the final say on that. He is not a doctor. I fear nobody’s gonna stand up to him. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I noticed. I'm guessing the speakers were all "ordered" to play it down and be upbeat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meg, are you getting the same impression (fear) as me? That he wants to end the lockdown soon, no matter what? That's scary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TrumpPresser Hmm, I guess he can read.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TrumpPresser  I wonder if someone will ask him what the unemployment number was this month? Oh wait, he begged them not to release it. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TrumpPresser  I don't see Dr. Fauci (sp)? NOT a good sign. I see lapdog #Barr tho. I'm really scared he's gonna get more desperate at the country's risk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TrumpPresser  Ok, I really am concerned that 45 will simply end this shutdown before we should. Can he defy medical experts? Is his word the final word, no matter what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump Lousy phony unrealistic speech. He just wants it to end, no matter the cost. I wonder if anyone went over this with him. He sounds desperate and unrealistic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump "Our country wasn't built to be shut down. American w/b soon open for business. A lot sooner than 3/4 months that ppl have suggested." Damn! He's gonna kill us all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well I am not in Canada, but I’ve not heard any of our American politicians comment on wrap freeze here either. I know my daughter pays rent which goes up every year. I’d love to see a freeze on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TeaPainUSA I read somewhere (I know sounds just like 45) that DT wants to end the isolation and open businesses again because of the economy(&amp; stock market I presume). I think that's the "Way" HE wants to go. Money! Money! Money!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TravisAllen02 Just unbelievable what 45 gets away with. 😡His own party/media sits back and lets him destroy our country thus becoming accomplices themselves. Imagine, if #Obama did a 10th of the shit that he does. Who’s going to be the hero/s who and speaks up?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>EVERY decision #Trump makes is for his own well-being, whether it be a profit financially or an ego booster.  Making a deal of some kind would sound just like him. He put some self above everyone and anything else.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>No sh*t. He has not earned, nor does he deserve respect. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am with you Nancy. I don’t put it past DT to order his people to find some favorable Poll or even make one up. That’s how a little confidence I have in him. The worse things get, the better his polls are? Very suspicious. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait! Isn’t a speedy trial one of the defendants rights?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Call me a skeptic, but I just find that harder and harder to believe.

<|startoftext|>Of course that's why. My guess is 45 is only doing it to cover his a** and make it seem like he cares. Either that AND/ OR he or his business or family will some how profit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’d love to see that. It would be a slap in the face to 45, and embarrass him. We know he can’t handle that. However, I don’t think our media has the nerve to do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree. The trashes them all the time and they sit back and take it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What she said! 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TulsiGabbard Suspended her campaign? Damn! And she was so close. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh yea, if that’s her only objection I’m not against putting a cap on it either. As far as Trump hotel accommodations, I totally agree. Don’t we all know by now, EVERYTHING he does has something in it for himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lol  Just what I was thinking. 😂The Lord and Master ordered her to refer to the #coronavirus as the “Chinese” virus and so be it. 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yea, I’m hearing that Pelosi was against it. But then I read that she wanted to put a cap on how much people earned to determine who gets the money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TrumpNewsConference:  Did I miss it or did he NOT say anything about the stimulus to individuals?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone calls it the #CoronaVirus, why does 45 insist on calling it "The Chinese Virus. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, I do recall there being a limit 100,000. Hmmm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought the trickle down Republican idea 🙄I’m still kind of unclear and would like to hear her exact comments on it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, if true, and Pelosi doesn’t want it, does that mean it doesn’t happen? Refusal by Pelosi to consider universal cash payments in response to coronavirus pandemic ‘maddening,’ say progressives  https://t.co/lqFquI6PCk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good question I wouldn’t mind reading the story also<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really?  I’m surprised and disappointed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, first case of #CoronaVirus in my city         FIRST CASE OF COVID-19 CONFIRMED IN THE CITY OF CORONA | Inner Circle News | City of Corona  https://t.co/8uafvVaK2P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Orangutan orange?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I didn’t know he was still running<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes he is the one that put him in charge. And he choose one that doesn’t take responsibility. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, are we gonna bail out the auto industry and airlines? I hear that's in the stimulus bill<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump,speaking now refers to the #CoronaVirus as the “Chinese Virus.”Why do I get the feeling by doing so he’s he’s distancing the US (himself)from any kind of blame as to how this is being handled? #MSNBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Media..... do your job. Let the people know this. This president does not care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My daughter is an elementary school teacher here in California I was told just a couple days ago that April 3 would be the return date. I’m glad #governorNewsom is being real and giving people a chance to plan what they are going to do.  Going to be difficult for a lot of people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course. #Trump does everything for money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good job #Moscow. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh yes. That would be the only reason he would agree to a stimulus, if it’s to bail himself out or make him look better. My question is do the rich get the stimulus as well?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@impeach_45NOW Yes because there’s so many drive-through pubs right? 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No really??? Ha ha ha ha 😂😂😂 that’s the best he could come up with? He would’ve been better off keeping his mouth shut.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor widdle #Moscow. Can’t take the heat, get out of the fire. Please go! 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s awful. What a sneaky, slimy, snakey turtle. 😡😡 Looks like Mitch McConnell fears catching a coronavirus-related condition – losing his job to a blue wave in November  https://t.co/NHtG1Phexh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump: “Our country can be rolling again very quickly, very quickly.” 🙄 such a way with words, no?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Is this ok? What a sack of sh*t. 😡Another story the media will not air? Panicked Mitch McConnell begging federal judges to retire before election as Trump’s 2020 prospects dim  https://t.co/jln1vOCbZ0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“ very strongly tested.🙄 or if he was tested, we will never find out and nobody will ever trust him for it because he can do whatever he wants. Even spread the virus if he has it. Sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@44mmvvpp Yes, they are reporting, even now on #Rachel, they are indicating this will be the new normal. 🤔😳☹️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@44mmvvpp Correction: don’t think it’s the AMA that approves it’s the Food/drug administration right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@44mmvvpp Well, it sure is encouraging. It may take a while for it to be approved by the AMA but at least something. Fingers crossed 🤞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh they did?  That would be fantastic. 🙏🏻 oh you can bet for sure fat ass will take some kind of credit for it. Did you hear him today giving himself on a scale of 1 to 10, a 10 for the way he’s handling this?🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh wa wa wa!  🙄Cry me a river.  You can’t pick supreme court judge during the election year and you can’t pick on poor little #MoscowMitch during election year. Give me a break. NO sympathy! 👿<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/C6uzp2VFLu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump, when asked how he’d rate himself in his response to the #coronavirus says he’d “rate himself a 10.”Would we expect anything else? 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It IS sick and shows exactly what’s the bottom line for these crooks. 😡Pretty sick also that msm isn’t covering it. Tho, I’ve been gone all morning if they discussed it today.  https://t.co/vsaYsfhSxq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maryderrickart I wonder why no one is reporting the story and or following up on it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does that include Mar a lago gatherings, or is he and  the Rs exempt?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DemDebate for some reason I don’t feel like watching. I’ve seen the mall I’m gonna skip this one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait! Who tells them? There’s never been rules not to take a picture in the airport. That doesn’t even sound legal. 😡 i’m guessing it’s to cover up just how conjested/bad the airports are right now. I wonder who would put out that order? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG, If true isn't this be huge story? My God, as we know, that is ALL that 45 cares about. Another quid pro quo? 😡 Imagine IF #PBO did that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politvidchannel God I hope so. 🙏🏻🤞👍 you would think the Republicans would be nervous but they’re acting that they don’t give a shit, still defending 45 downplaying the coronavirus. Are they that stupid?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey, but at least the party goes on a Mar-A-Lago and 45 can still make money. 🙄No worries 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I went to Ralphs today and the toilet paper aisle was totally empty. I don’t get it. Why toilet paper? I mean I understand you need toilet paper but that why is it the first thing I did go out and get?🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree. I’ve never seen this question or talked about in the media at all. Seems I could be worth investigating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And did these people isolate themselves or does the party still going on? 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He either got tested and it came back positive and he doesn’t wanna share the results; or maybe he tested and is pulling the same BS as he did with his taxes. He says will see them but then we will never see the results. Deceptive either way, but that’s his MO. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. It’s my hope, whether it’s  #Biden or #Bernie, that he would choose female VP ( #HHarris)It’s time. And, after one term step aside and let the VP run.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonOverstreet I saw it. Mr. a**wipe macho man telling the little lady to calm down. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahh so he could very well know the results and doesn’t want to say? And there is only one reason why he would not want to see the results, right? Then why the hell is he around a bunch of people? 😡🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, he mentioned that yesterday and then I read that Google was not making a website. Why is he saying it again today? Did things change or is he just talking out of his a** again?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And, not only that, even if he were to test negative, that doesn’t change the fact that within days he could come in contact with the virus and test positive. You still need to take precautions. His ego is so big he probably thinks not even a virus can attack him. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. His attitude really sucks. He’s not even taking precautions. And the people around him on the stage there continues to agree with him. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MSNBC just now: Trump sends autographed photo of stock market gains to his supporters?   Ha ha ha ha😂😂Somebody's desperate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What? Trump lies? How unusual. 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So 45 is actually going to tweet his approval for this deal? I thought it was supposed to do that hours ago? He’s playing his reality TV games again. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lying just comes so natural to him. It seems as though none of the people who support and care. How pathetic is that? 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HE is the national emergency.  https://t.co/2ViQsnaGnb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ditto!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whew! That is a relief. Can you even imagine how pissed #Trump would be having the woman he fears and hates take over his job. Kind of puts a smile on my face. 😉😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How in the hell is that a “nasty” question? 🙄 He childishly lashes out because he knows he’s guilty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God bless him. We need all the help we can get. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s wonderful. Thank you Jack Ma. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ya think?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, she was great and so direct. 45 says "I don't have any symptoms." He could STILL transfer the virus to others. How can he NOT be responsible?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course he didn’t. He always lies. He could never ever admit that he’s done anything wrong. 🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump was just asked if he and his staff were tested and he said "No we have no symptoms."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TrumpPressConference  Ha ha Now #Pence is kissing a** complimenting 45 on what a great job he's done. 😂😂 I wonder if 45 wrote that for Pence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TrumpPressConference  He invited all these people to speak because he wanted to kill time. He can't talk too long cause he doesn't know what he's talking about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course he doesn't. I always say he puts his "big boy" pants on so he can pretend he's an adult.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TrumpPressConference I see at least one guy shook 45's hand. Since he's been exposed and not tested, that's pretty risky.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha.  Mr. Stable Genius." 🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see he keeps looking down at his paper. Damn, he can read???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the sake of our country, I pray to God it's over. 🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good point. We must always remember, everything Trump does is to benefit himself. Don’t we all know this by now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha. Very cute. 😂 and you know just a week or so ago my dog was sick and I was wondering if it was possible if she had this virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have no doubt that he does everything to help himself, but how exactly will that help him? The more he waits the more people will be infected. What am I missing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is good news finally.  New test 10 times faster is FDA approved  https://t.co/nsWwqCDXDF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He LIES all the time. It’s not misspeaking or misstating or exaggerating, it’s Lying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely. I’m hearing just now on #MSNBC that this administration was warned of possibility of a virus like this happening in January 2019. And also it was #Trump that dismantled a department that was to handle this type of thing. #WORSTPresidentEver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyOstroy @JanSImagine @realDonaldTrump @CDCgov 👍<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This does not surprise me at all. He is so extremely jealous of Obama, and wants to and is succeeding in some areas to destroy everything Obama did it out of spite. 🙄😡He’ll NEVER be the honorable man #PBO is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One would think so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course he should be, but I am learning, at least with this president, he is all powerful and doesn’t have to comply with anything. If he does not do this and puts the country at risk will it matter to people? I don’t know 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is big news. I’m glad that he came around and saw the light. I’m sure the fact that he’s a physician also had a big impact on him I have to wonder, will this be what does 45 in?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DT on the #CoronaVirus, “One day it’ll disappear, like a miracle, it’ll disappear.” 🙄 does he ever even try to be presidential?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmm well if being quarantined means they cannot perform their duties, I would guess it would be # Pelosi to take over. 😂 Man wouldn’t that piss the Rs off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes! Exactly what I was thinking. I have no sympathy for them they have to get off their asses and come forward. A bunch of chickensh*ts who put themselves before the country. 😡Shame on them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aBarnes94 @FridaGhitis @NoahShachtman And those cowards are as much to blame is 45 is. Shame on them. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe it’s time for these administration officials to put their big boy/girl pants on and go public with just how inept and WRONG this president is. Do you think maybe putting the country before politics is The right thing to do? Grow a pair!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone watching #Rachel?  She is now and how unprepared our country is for this virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course. He is making money. I keep saying that it’s what he is all about. That is all he cares about. He’s been exposed to people who tested positive with coronavirus; and he refuses to be tested yet he has large gatherings and could possibly infect hundreds. $$$$$<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hell yeah should be prosecuted to the fullest. Gee, I wonder if the Republicans would consider that impeachable 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wirter Where is this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree he’s going home for a three day weekend while our country is in crisis. If that is insane he doesn’t care then I don’t know what is. Vote him out!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is tough because I love all his songs.Mother &amp; Child Reunion, Kodachrome among my favs but then Graceland is good too.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So He doesn’t care if he spreads it not only to all the people he’s in contact with throughout the day but even his own family? And there’s no way he can be forced to be tested, especially if he thinks he may have it?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And we know 45 refuses to be tested are the others?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s “ruining”. 🤪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely true. And they should be held accountable for contributing and being complacent to this mess it’s on them as well. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will any of his clan ever break loose from him and admit he’s running the country? They should team with the Democrats and try and fix it. I mean really fix<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ha ha. Don’t know whether to think of him as a joke, like Bozo the clown, or fear him like Pennywise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeanCasten @GOP And they are still defending him. I guess they all want to go down the same drain together. I just pray it’s very soon. 🙏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surely you jest!  😂 those two words just don’t go together. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, I just read he refuse to be tested for the coronavirus. Maybe he has that. I’d sure hate to be around him ever, but especially now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is his reason I wonder? He should be forced to be tested. Look at all the other people he could infect? Wtf He can do absolutely anything he wants at the risk of our peoples health and it’s OK because he’s the president? BS😡 he probably fears he has it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snarkymom428 @KCBoyd3 @deepend100 @1980Dorothy Oh it is? OK then I’ll delete my comment. Pretty strange all that all of us would not be surprised if it were the truth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh yes! Tax breaks for the rich mean tax breaks for him. And of course we know he cares about the stock market because that involves his money as well. His bottom line is and always will be himself. Anyone who thinks he cares about anybody else, you have a rude awakening.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ha ha. That’s really catchy. It really makes me want to go wash my hands and clap along. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was in the same situation about a year ago turned out negative for me. I hope it’s the same for you. Best of luck. Wish you well<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Someone tweeted that you can fly into the UK from almost anywhere and then fly to the United States. If that’s true sort of a loophole isn’t it? I don’t trust anything $.45. Always take it with a grain of salt, or a shot of whiskey 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. He’s trying to sound like a big boy, or in his view like a president. The words are coming out of his mouth but he’s not even paying attention to what those words are. I’m guessing you can’t wait to get the hell out of there. Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bet now #Trump is on Twitter waiting for comments on his comments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump “ we must put politics aside.” 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And he’s coming on TV shortly to give it yet another spin. I am not sure exactly how his spinet today or who he’ll blame though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait. I just heard today that tests were free<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I asked him the same thing. Crickets. 🦗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely, I’ve been saying that for years. There’s no reason to have a cap except to benefit the wealthy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha. I was looking forward to Bloomberg‘s ads. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Kushner doing research?🙄 is he a scientist or a doctor or what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since he wants to limit what the public knows, I’m guessing he insisted on doing this news conference so he can put a rosy spin on the coronavirus. He is so totally inapt and unqualified 😡🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow!  Really? 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly!! I am surprised this isn't bigger news. It should be. He plans to keep the public in dark and HE will decide what we need to know? And the lapdog Rs remain silent. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ditto!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do we know why? I got an article earlier saying that he wanted all the info from these meetings kept confidential. Nothing shady there right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For sure. He opens his mouth, he lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That would make me extremely happy and way more enthusiastic about a #Biden presidency.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jgeltzer I sure as hell hope the media cover is this often and loudly so the people can see what’s going on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jgeltzer No! That is just plain wrong. And somebody has to have the balls to fight him on this. He’s trying to keep the public from knowing what a disaster he is handling this pandemic. It’s on him and he’s too embarrassed to present the facts. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🖐Me. It’s either DT, 45 or my petname, f**k face. NEVER the P word.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It sounds like a threat to me. #ChiefJusticeRoberts are you going to reprimand this person? Oh wait, of course not, he’s a Republican. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve never bought into it either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, there will always be some who overdosed on the kool aid, BUT we can still make ppl aware if we can. Hopefully the majority will see the light of the Russia interference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was gonna say the same.  The hashtag is what drew my attention. I say just ignore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I try to never respond to them. It's best to ignore IMO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes and I hear 45 Thanks that another tax cut will solve the problem. Moron!!😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's only about him....,.always. Himself and money.  I hear he wants to give another tax break to help with the coronavirus. WTF Money in his pocket/re-election... ALWAYS about him and ONLY him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best wishes to you Keith. I hope you get well soon. Take care of yourself. 🙏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, does she hang out in areas where people shooting up heroin?  😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Primary. With #Biden win, does that mean the investigation and a #HunterBiden is back in the news? 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I must say I am shocked as well. I did not vote for Bernie but I would’ve thought he would’ve done much better. It sounds like a lot of the young people just did not show up. Or, maybe people had second thoughts. I don’t know, but I’m shocked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We know we can’t really trust the administration and the fact that this virus continues to expand  ales it more worrisome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At mass every Sunday after the sermon, we pray for the poor and the sick etc &amp;always the priest includes to “pray for our leaders to show compassion/understanding and love for all ppl.”I always think of 45, and how he is the opposite. No, this Catholic is definitely not for Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like them both, but my choice would be #Harris.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #Biden wins Presidency, he will be only the second Catholic president. It was such a big deal when #JFK ran.  Also if #Biden picks #Harris as VP, I will be way more enthused about his presidency. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#2020Primaries Im really surprised at results so far, with Bernie falling behind.  He always had huge rallies and a massive following. One with think he’d be in the lead. I am guessing the young people once again did not turn out to vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like you care. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does it seem like we’re watching “All he President’s YES Men”with this #CoronaVirus news conference? 🙄Btw, I am a senior does that mean there’s gonna be tax cuts in my Social Security and pension checks since I’m  in the high risk group?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It sure is a scam. I don’t buy it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why not retweet that person‘s comments perhaps with the hashtag “#IfDemslose, it’s because of you.” Hopefully will get thousands of retweets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes but will they?  Seems 45 is free to do as he pleases. I assume this will go to the Supreme Court. Conservatives rule that court, thus they likely side with Trump and conclude DOJ Will not have to comply. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So #Trump floating another tax cut to help the markets? How will that affect my SS/Pension?? OR, will it only affect the rich AGAIN? As an elder person on SS, and supposedly at most risk, I'm wondering? 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Republican refusing to self-quarantine spotting giving tour of the U.S. Capitol to Texas tourists  https://t.co/DxAY9S2SOG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m thinking, what about when  use my debit card at the grocery store and put in your security #, do I wear gloves do I bring wipes, do I take a chance? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good question. It would seem so, since he’s able to do anything he wants without anybody stopping him. I suppose we should not put anything past him. Especially, since we know how desperate he is now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hear you. He will try to work with them and they will Block anything and everything that he and the D’s want. Don’t we know the drill by now? 🙄 yes I’ll vote for him, but I am not very confident at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the judge could condemn it but not stop them from taking the posters down? When it is for the good of the people? The president can override that? If so, what a crock of sh*t. 😡 Cable and or media you should be recording this cover-up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So regular people have to be held on a ship indefinitely but if you’re Republican congressman you can refuse quarantine and give tours of the Capitol? WTF Republican refusing to self-quarantine spotting giving tour of the U.S. Capitol to Texas tourists  https://t.co/DxAY9S2SOG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, ain’t that the truth? A exceptional mess this time around<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha. 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whistleblowers revealing wrongdoing during Trump administration’s coronavirus response have a key new ally  https://t.co/NaLfHXuWHU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Journalist will "purposely" try to contract the virus?" Are you kidding me? 🙄Talk about paranoid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was a member of the union for over 20 yrs. Pay was decent, good healthcare, raises,paid sick days/vacation;union representation if you felt you were treated unfairly. Now retired, I have a pension as well. Union dues were $39 a month. I would do it again to be in the union.😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks. No incidents of this virus in your area?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am glad to hear today a few stories about the importance of the presidential nominee to pick a female VP. I will vote for him, but #Biden is not my choice. If he added #Harris or other qualified woman to his ticket, that would make it easier to vote for him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If 45 Staff is infected by large number, do you really think he would allow it to be publicized? I don’t. And, it seems whatever he says goes. 😡 as usual, he can do whatever he pleases.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is really a cult of brainwashed and/or willfully ignorant people who wouldn’t know the truth if it slapped him in the face, or don’t care about the truth. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha. It likely would explode. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My sister is coming for a visit from Michigan in a couple weeks. We are going to go to Santa Monica pier and to Carlsbad pier as well. I’m afraid to eat anywhere or go anywhere with boats and ships are docked.  ☹️Hey, but 45 says all is well, right?😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg!!! 😳 how can anyone not be concerned when this virus is popping up all over, not to mention the fact that we have an inapt president that refuses to believe the facts. 🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm guessing 45 will be in hibernation for a while.   https://t.co/969JZu8mnW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably cause I read the 45 is very fearful that someone in his staff might give him the virus.  That's ALL he cares about is himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only interested in his bottom line...himself. The hell with the country. So typical!!!! Trump is privately ‘melting down’ and fears journalists will contract coronavirus to infect him on Air Force One: report  https://t.co/969JZu8mnW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To see the most corrupt administration in the history of our country, look in the mirror Bucko!!! 🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And how many people could if he unknowingly infected?   https://t.co/qcXrlaUTWg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AndreaMitchell just now on 45 #CoronaVirus comments: calling them, "Corrections; misstatements; downplaying it." Say what it f**kiing is.. LYING 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course they should, but I don’t think they would.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He may not have been my choice as a president, but I like that he has unlimited cash and he’s on the Democrat side wanting Trump out. Truly giving Trump a run for his money. And we know who’s got more money.. it ain’t 45, that’s for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@essenviews It’s about time someone had the guts to play the same game that 45 playing. We all know there’s got to be dirt?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha! 🤞🙏🏻👍 can you imagine?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it’s a great idea. As soon as I click on the video, I see the blue warning that it’s a manipulated video. To me that’s an indication that I’m not even going to look at it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s cute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time to open up an investigation on the Trumpster kids<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What jerks!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And, because he’s president that gives him unlimited power to do whatever the f**k he wants? He can block health experts from health warnings/info, even when lives are at risk? Wtf😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“Misleading Boast?” Wtf media?  Call it what it is. A lie!!Don’t keep coddling this moron😡 AP FACT CHECK: Trump’s misguided boast on virus poll ratings  https://t.co/4IUa9xwAzf via @YahooLifestyle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am really glad to hear that. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really? With everything else that’s going on, this is what you’ve got to complain about?  🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosephSakran He's ignorant, uncaring, has no clue of facts, not to mention he has no idea what he is doing. EVERYONE should be concerned and admit he's total incompetence. In short, he NEEDS to be impeached/resign..whatever GTFO! 😡Rs must STOP kissing his a**.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg 😳😂😂😂😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Republican clown show?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes and that is an insult to imbeciles. 🙄 and, isn’t it just amazing how some people can still worship this unstable moron?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haha. He still better than #Collins. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not today’s Republican.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That doesn't change the fact that he made a threat. He needs to apologize.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CheifJusticeRoberts. Perhaps this congressman should be reprimanded and issue an apology?  Or, are Republicans immune from such things?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ignorant, just like their leader, DT 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At first I thought it was a pro #Biden ad But I see many Democrat faces in the video.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha. That is great!!!! 👌👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Such a deep thinker. 🙄His bullshit line of everything’s gonna be OK is wearing pretty thin. He can’t think beyond that sentence. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the first time ever, due to this particular primary, I really have a feeling #Biden (or #Sanders) WILL chose a female running mate. I think they’ll hear about it if they don’t.  Several good ones to choose from, I think my choice would be #Harris.  #Warren is good as well 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🙄🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, that must be his goal for every Democrat that’s president is to block everything. How the f**k does this guy keep his job? Is there ever a point when ethics and fairness matter? Silly me, this is politics, of course not. 😡🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can only assume that #Mueller concluded the same thing. Why the hell did he speak up or say something, he was very disappointing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes but #Bidens the one that wants to reach out and work with the other side. 🙄This is where I have my doubts that he’s strong enough to handle what we know is going to be a downpour from 45. He should immediately have the Trump kids investigated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For sure. 😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RabbiJill @ewarren I liked her before, but I like her even more after this interview.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ElizabethWarren on #Rachel this hour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom @Idocki1 That’s good 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump tells Fox News he’s going after Social Security and Medicare: ‘We’ll be cutting’  https://t.co/foGtwcJRoT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cool. I would be OK with any of them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They will appeal the decision and then it’ll end up ontne Supreme Court.  We might have an answer by next year sometime by our right leaning SCOTUS. Don’t we know the drill by now?🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is great!!!!!👌👍😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great@but I assume it’s going to go to the supreme court now so we won’t really see it yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤞👍👌🙏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You BOTH are great fighters. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🙄🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to #Warren just now makes me even more sad to see her drop out. 😪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump always uses phrases like “a lot of people say”, or “I’m hearing from people” or “they say”..... without saying which people he’s referring to. Thats because it’s not true and the media never questioned him on it or expose him for what he is a liar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You did a great job #SenatorWarren. Keep up the good fight. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AMitchell Just now on 45 He’s being criticized for minimizing the effect of the coronavirus” minimizing? How about out right lying. 🙄😡 The media is just as bad as kissing his ass as the Republicans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So #Schumer apologizes for "the words he used" about SC Justices.  🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On #MSNBC #KellyODonnell tries to make 45 look "knowledgeable" about #CoronaVirus after he disputes health experts. Call it what it is...an outright LIE!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ElizabethWarren since Tuesday’s results, I can’t say I am shocked but can’t say I’m really sad to hear this. ☹️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If we are lucky #MoscowMitch will lose as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha 😂😂 DT would totally freak out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“All the negative things left for you is #Obamas fault.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’d be happy with any of them, but my favorite would be #Harris. Then again, she would make a great attorney general.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait!  This is a second grand princess cruise ship?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To quote Vinny Barbarino: “I’m so confused.” 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see it was updated today probably to coincide with the fact that LA declared a state of emergency   https://t.co/H9adiNfvIq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh I see, it happen February 11 but the article is March 4.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The article is dated March 4.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@44mmvvpp Thanks. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So how long before 45 in his clan begin their outrage yet again about #HunterBiden?? 🙄🙄 do you know it’s going to start again. That’s all they have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PMJoy is Joy going to have that timeslot permanently? 🤞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He can probably buy and sell 45. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course you do. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is so wrong on every level. And we hear about these situations every election. Why the hell can’t we do something to fix it. That is voter suppression no matter how you slice it. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#KHarris would be a great VP. But then, I think she’d be a great attorney general as well. I sure hope if he wins he picks her for one of those two positions. She would be great at either<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh no! I hadn't heard. I sure hope they can contain it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. And watch, the next election will be the same thing. It won’t quite be the time for a woman President. 🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👍🖐👌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I too am really surprised. ☹️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was wondering the same thing. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Biden. If I may think ahead, what if the Ds take back the Senate and have both houses. What if #Biden nominates #PBO for SCOTUS? How cool would that be? AND imagine the RW outrage 😂 I would love it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha  For sure. 😂Who would’ve ever thought, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That more or less sums up how I feel too. They reported today that she was reassessing the situation. I am guessing she’s at least thinking about dropping out. 😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh get out of here. 🙄 Quit trying to stir the pot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Californiaprimary2020 just checking tallies here in California I see Bernie 60 more than #Biden here, so not sure it’ll matter. Question, for candidates who dropout, can they give their delegates to the nominee or are they just lost?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes they are Boomers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SuperTuesday  So, What time can we expect returns? It’s past 5 o’clock eastern time now. I know it will be a while yet for California<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, now Rs are voting #Biden? I thought they were voting #Sanders? 🤔🙄 Republicans crossing over to vote Biden in primaries will likely stick with him in November: conservative columnist  https://t.co/9jpg9SIJYV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“UpChuck” 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Warren<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AND, how many #NeverBerners (there are many)will vote for Trump, write in, or not vote at all? We might be screwed all the way around. There’s so much hate going around. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My concern/question is what if #Sanders has the most delegates but #Biden has more votes. Can’t democrats use their delegates or super delegates to change the winner? And will they?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg. Again? I thought this was over? Do we know who’s issuing the complaint? I assume a republican.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DeadlineWH after tomorrow I think we’ll have a pretty good idea of what way the election is going to go.  I really really want #Warren and I have not given up, but I have a feeling it’ll be between #Biden and #Sanders. I’ll vote for either of them. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tho I missed first part of discussion ,Believe it or not I actually agreed with #DavidJolly. Dems must be careful. They NEED #Bernie supporters if #Biden gets nom.  Also agree MANY ppl WANT M4All in spite of negative spin on it. Worth trying for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now, how can this be OK? 😡  https://t.co/2yVNzq10Zg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder if she’s a bit “concerned” or “disturbed” at all. Oh well, even if she is, she’ll end up going along with 45. Don’t we know the drill by now? 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PeteToWarren IMO, tomorrow will tell the tale, OR at least give us indication who the race will be between. I'm good with any of them BUT because #Biden wins his first state (a big win), the fact that he's being crowned winner while still behind is baffling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha. Hmm 77 or 78; white or white??? Both men. Doesn’t get much more diverse than that. Such a tough decision 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh no!!!!!😳 and there is no escape! 😳😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh wonderful WTF  Lab making coronavirus test kits may have been contaminated: report -  https://t.co/KERHFbKr7U<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m in California and sent my vote in for her a few weeks ago. 🤞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok,with both #Buttigieg and #Steyers out where do you think those votes will go?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DropOutBernie I'm thinking the odds of the front runner dropping out at this point are slim to none.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She is my choice. 👍👌🤞🙏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hell yea. Saw it at the movie theater when it came out. They had an intermission, you should’ve seen the lobby, people freaked out people smoking like crazy. I heard one guy say “not the kind of movie you want to go to on a first date. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha. Really? 🙄😂 OMG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. I saw that movie and enjoyed it. I have never seen the real Katherine Johnson until they announced she had passed away. I saw a picture of #PBO giving her the medal of honor also.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's true as far as likeable characters. Btw, did you know that #OliviaDeHavilland is the only cast member from GWTW that is still alive at 103?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I read yesterday that there was a ridiculously high charge of $6,000? Anyone else read that? That's horrible. Then I read abut O-care. Yes, thanks #PBO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SCPrimary Anybody give info on how crowded the polls are, lines waiting to vote? I heard earlier at least in whatever district they were speaking with that there were “slightly” more voters than last election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. I do not believe I’ve ever seen that clip of her excepting the award before. How touching. And yes, the article does make you stop and think. I do not ever show her character outside of her life with Scarlet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is good to know. How do we know that 45 hasn’t deleted that provision?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NO!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow if that happens I’d even pay to see that. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lol. He’s not my candidate, and there is Nothing wrong with him getting down, but I got to say, some people have the moves and some don’t. But, he’s trying. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope. I just turned the channel I don’t care to see it.I am sure he’ll say it’s a hoax, the Democrats fault and play it down by saying “we have it all under control. “ The same bullshit, different day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree. Think of how much we don’t know that they are covering. I hope it all comes to light and all those people kissing his ass and bowing before him as he destroys our country, should rot in hell. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Robert, may I ask if there is any one person you wish were in the running, or is it a matter of no good choices at all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SouthCarolina  34% of AA voters wish someone else were running. Wow! That's a large chunk of people no?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even though some of these are very close, I’ve seen more than one poll indicating all the contenders will beat 45. So doesn’t that sort of make the electability argument irrelevant?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HTakesAction @onecaliberal #Warren #Boomer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I remember that clip. It makes me miss him more. What a real caring person he is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me for sure. It’s always 45 or DT. When it comes to him I can’t get that P word out of my mouth. It just seems SO wrong. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@duty2warn I wonder if anybody from America will respond to that? One would think so. It is worth an investigation/inquiry no?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha. I live in the city of Corona. I imagine nobody will want to be coming here. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well give them to the 24 seven guards like Epstein had. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn I miss him. Such a down to earth, nice, caring, wonderful president. I wish I would’ve had a chance to meet him. We went from the cream of the crop to scraping the very bottom of the barrel. 😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You’re kidding right???? 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good point. Could have been I suppose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Am I the only one who is beginning to think that 90% of his followers are just plain ignorant? Willfully or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha. Really? Gee, I never heard that before. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pewky<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know right? Nothing fishy about that. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomthunkitsMind If this is true, it sure would be nice if our media would report it. 😡🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow! #Trump not only became the 3rd President in history to be impeached BUT also presided over the biggest stock market point loss in history as well. Talk about "losing." Make America great again? Yea right!!! Resign!!! 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think you’re going to give him ideas. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BREAKING  So, #Trump instructs health official NOT to speak on #CoronaVirus w/o clearance from #Pence. This seems so wrong. He's covering up. WTF. 😡  #MSNBC #DeadlineWhitehouse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My ballot is signed, sealed and delivered. #VotingByMail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dax_x98 Peanut butter of course. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m just 3 miles east of Orange County in the city Corona!! 😳Oh no. That can’t be very lucky. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m glad to hear it. I would not be a good luck if she came off biased<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HKrassenstein Do you know where the shooting occurred?  School, Mall etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh man!! What a happy thought.  Ppl please vote!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s amazing. I wish the Democrats would talk about that more and perhaps have a Canadian Rep Or patients like yourself explain how that works. Maybe we can’t do it immediately but I am confident some form of that type of healthcare can be accomplished.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s pretty much my preference also. Although I might switch Buttigieg and Biden. I’ve noticed a white version of opinions on TV this morning I said who did well and who didn’t. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I’m sure his heads up their ass clan actually believe it. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course Republicans are going to speak up now. Stocks going down hits them where it hurts.  🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really? I had no idea people paid to see debates 😳 $1750?  That’s outrageous.  I could never afford that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Endure? Is that really you? 😂 do you have your ID? 😂 j/k 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. What a turn off. CBS is covering also. I’m switching back-and-forth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly! The stock market will hurt him and make him look bad that is the only reason why he pretends to care<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Warren (you left the women out) 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DemDebate honestly, I think I’ve made my decision and don’t need any more debates. They actually should have regular people asking the questions like the moderators just do the timing or something. Regular people will ask better questions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MomWithAnS Really is that a surprise? I’m sure it’s still happening today he’s always complementing him self on how well he’s doing in the polls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t think so at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since I don’t have a spouse then I’ll go with the 20 million. 😂 I assume my check is in the mail. 😂😉<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>How do we know that video wasn’t altered?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunking @JoeBiden “The other #Biden?” What does that mean? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know, does it drive you crazy sometimes? Sometimes I text somebody using auto correct  and dont proof it, and won’t discover til after I send it said it doesn’t make any sense at. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bye bye 45!,,😂🖐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha. Yeah quite a difference from when he walked in hunched over hanging onto walker. And as he has it in cuffs is walking straight and normal. Doing the perp walk. 😂😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GOOD!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#HarveyWeinstein  Glad helps going to prison. I’m curious though how much time he’ll get. Watch,#Trump May very well pardon him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LMAO 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#kobememorial was not able to see the beginning but this tribute is very moving. #ChristinaAguilera just sang Ave Maria great job<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well put Robert. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree. Btw, “John F. Roosevelt Obama?” Has a nice ring to it. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not real sure I thought Bernie got 35 from Nevada, but not positive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes but Biden has to win more than just one state correct?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤞👌👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He’s a chickensh*t. He has no clue how to be President let alone debate, and no interest in what’s going on in our government. Unless of course, he thinks somebody’s being mean to him and then he’ll start his childish name-calling. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mailed my ballot in a couple weeks ago and voted for #Warren as well. 🤞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmm. Not that I would ever want to see the pictures mind you, 😳but the story behind it may be interesting and something the people should know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And look how people fell for it. Seriously, you can’t believe anything anymore, even from the White House. Truth doesn’t matter. We have to figure some of this stuff out by ourselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it's too early and he's too far behind to announce a running mate. It'll sound like he thinks he's entitled and a "sure win."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Election if everybody dropped out except #Sanders #Warren &amp; #Biden,  where do you think the majority of those votes would go?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m with you. I’m hearing some say that certain people should just drop out now. I think once super Tuesday is over, that’s when those was not doing well should drop out. I’m not giving up on #Warren yet, but I think they all should be given a chance thru Super Tuesday at least<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I stopped watching him a few years ago for that exact reason. #JoyReid was defending him earlier today saying he didn’t really mean it that way. He probably didn’t, but I always get the impression that he blurts these things out just to keep talking lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, WH is denying that Russia is trying to help #Trump win the election. So media, is that the end of the story? The White House says that’s the case then it must be the case right? 😡🙄 #MSNBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha. I haven’t heard that term in ages 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FWIW They cut off #Warren  speech earlier as well, they said they’d be played in its entirety at 11.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha. Well, then I guess there’s nothing to see here right? 🙄 pretty sad when you can’t trust your countries security advisor, but sadly that’s the case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‘I am disgusted and sickened’: MSNBC blasted for the network’s coverage of Nevada Caucuses  https://t.co/wx1UVTVtTz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree, and I’m surprised more people aren’t more confident since polls show that all the candidates would beat Trump that’s a good thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course. I’d like to see RBG speak up as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly we can’t eliminate the fact that it could be another electoral college win. Which would be the third in my lifetime. What are the odds? 🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, he’s a self proclaimed  law-enforcement officer in the country”, so I imagine he’ll do as he pleases. And I imagine nobody would do jack sh*t. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. That's what is kind of surprising because all members were sent a flyer cautioning about #Sanders health plan. Didn't seem to make a difference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NVCaucus Evidently the Culinary Union sent flyer to members cautioning about #Sanders health plan. That didn't seem to make a difference. Go figure!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AND #Putins plan seems to be working. I pray we come together no matter who ends up winning. I know I'll vote for the winner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I may continue my rant😂 While breaking down number large percentage of  #Sanders votes came from the culinary union ppl. Recall union did NOT endorse anyone AND love their healthcare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes I am sure they are which is why I'm trying hard to be skeptical when I see tweets that are "ify" or suspicious. Hard to tell but I am trying NOT to be too gullible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are the totals they're reporting a combination of the caucus votes and the early voting?  Btw, I've suggested/predicted that THIS election the young voters will come out in droves. I think that's what's happening. They're turning the tide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, this caucus IS confusing that's for sure. I wish to hell they'd just F**ing vote for the candidate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NVCaucus #JoyReid just nailed the reality of what's happening, expressing that young ppl are initiating this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too. I did not vote for him but it’s obvious so many people hate him. I don’t think Putin is smart enough to know which candidate will beat 45. Just now #JamesCarvell, #McCaskill &amp; entire panel panicking. Also, I’m not so sure the election is it rigged already via Trump/Putin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg. 🙄😡 as soon as I saw his face I changed the channel. I’m glad I did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And yet not a peep out of media. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course he will. 🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m kind of glad to see Twitter doing this, however it seems impossible that they be able to catch all of these manipulative tweets. But at least they’re  trying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Warren<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Warren<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NevadaCaucus. So, will we know the caucus results at the end of the day? And then is there also an election? With the people of Nevada voting? Or is it only the caucus goers that vote?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, he did say he was the “chief law-enforcement officer of the country.”Let’s not be surprise should he try to do it. And let’s not be surprise if he’s allowed to. Unfortunately, that’s where we are. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mjs_DC @Slate I have not even heard the story that’s far on MSNBC. Is anyone reporting? Coming from her, I would think this would be major. 😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Justice Sotomayor writes a devastating rebuke of her conservative colleagues’ callousness and fealty to Trump  https://t.co/gCIWEKyBii<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If this turns out where the DNC chooses the winner as opposed to the people, no matter who the winner THEY choose is, to me it’s just totally wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bernie is not my first choice, and I am disappointed at those who are for the DNC choosing the winner. I’ve never understood why the People’s vote should not be the one to be counted as the final vote. How is that democratic?🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let’s see, either have lunch with “dungs” or clean dungs?  I’ll go with option two. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. Very “real” and scary conversation about this election. Seriously, it’s putting me in panic mode.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same here. Any hope I may have had that #Roberts would be fair/just went out the window.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😪😪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmandiOnAir This blows me away because of whom it's coming from? Does this mean the majority of SCOTUS are totally bias and will do whatever 45 wants? How disgraceful is that? Sorry, but this is like doomsday IMO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh no! Coming from A SCJustice, (who would know), that is pretty damn scary. 😡Hard to believe that NO republicans care. Are there no "normal" conservatives any more?😪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg! 🙄 Figures. I’m sure if he waits long enough 45 will exonerate him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too bad all of California doesn’t announce their vote on Twitter. We could take a tally right now. 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m happy to see so many fellow Californians are voting for #Warren.  If I’m not mistaken she just misses the margin of error range, although that could change at any time right?  😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sent mine last week for #Warren also.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sent I my ballot for #Warren last week. 🤞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, as he said, he’s the chief law enforcement officer in the country, so we can do whatever the f**k he wants. 🙄 not that I have any sympathy for #Bolton.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Bolton had his chance to be a hero and he chose to sell his book. Cry me a river. 🙄 he and Trump are made of the same cloth anyway they deserve each other<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Assuming 45 will be able to do that, that kind of throws a wrench in Bolton get rich quick scheme. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brycetache All I’m hearing and reply to this story is the people who decide in November. 🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MSNBC not impressed at all with #DennyHeck. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DennyHeck on #MSNBC says the only solution is in November. I am tired of hearing that. Especially now after today’s news. Pisses me off. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#RussiaInterference. #MSNBC reporting that not only are they interfering in the presidential but they also are interfering and state elections.  They say this is a political 911 disaster. Yet, #MoscowMitch and the Republicans are doing nothing 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh yes. Remember #Harris questioning #Kavanaugh? She is fantastic!!!! 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg 😳 He is such a baby, no make that a moron.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#RussianInterference How hard would it be for #Pelosi and/or #Schiff and #McConnell to do what #Bernie did and tell #Russia to stay the F**k out of our elections?  Everyone is so scared of saying something. WTF 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha!! That's a great campaign slogan. 😂👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wanted #Kamala too. I wish she was still in the race. However, IMO they gave neither of the two main female candidates enough coverage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We sure CAN have a woman President. No doubt about it. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve heard nobody from the Republican or the Democratic Party for that matter give such a strong message to butt out. For the most part they’re silent and I’m waiting for somebody to show the outrage. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many of us are asking the same thing? Is impeachment a one time thing and after that the president can do whatever and not have to worry? I think not. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As I understand, the jury is hung on two main charges (sexual predator?). If he ends up getting convicted of the lesser charges, I have little confidence that he’ll serve much time in jail. And you’re right, he will not stop. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy to hear it. 👌🤞👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politvidchannel Why just 3?  How many are there?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s “Whomever the nominee is.”  😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You are not alone, I see it too. He is not my first choice, but I will vote for whomever phenomena years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great idea. However, I don’t think 45 would ever do it. I’m wondering if you even do debates once we get a nominee for president.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha. I may not necessarily want him for president, but I sure love his ads bashing Trump. Don’t you just know it’s getting under 45s skin?  😂  https://t.co/CYiJsHmX9N<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly, I don’t know. A lot of people work at families and have a hard time if they have to travel to certain areas to March. Also, the media is playing this down and not reporting enough the seriousness of it for the most part, and I’m wondering how many people are tuned in?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👍👌🙏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet another impeachable offense? But we are told to wait for the election and let the people decide? Very likely a rigged election? WTF. 😡Come on media, do your effing job. We can’t depend on Republicans, but you guys can report it. Di it..big-time. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SafetyPinDaily Yet another story of a quid pro quo that isn't a big deal to anyone. Does this not deserve to be investigated, let alone covered at length via msm? 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UrbanAchievr AND the fact that this crime is taking place months before our next Presidential election, a normal person might think this is a massive emergency. But alas, these are not normal times it seems. 😪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UrbanAchievr @gumboqueen3030 It sure is. AND, isn't it amazing that Dems, media aren't emphasizing this? I do not get what it'll take for the wake up call. NORMALLY, we'd have a House/Congress work together on these things w/o bias. NOW, it's party first. 😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes it is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do too. My name is Ann. 😂 Some family/friends call me Annie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is another story that I don’t understand why the media is not pursuing. It’s almost as though they’re protecting 45.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha. Man that perfectly reflects 45. 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree and am appalled that it’s not happening. I mean wtf will  it take? 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That seems pretty petty of them doesn’t it? If they have a problem #Twitter Should just notify that person. I don’t consider people giving their opinions in speaking their mind is a problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. With this new Russia election interference story especially, deserves investigation.  😡 I just wonder how many more shoes have to drop before the Republicans will take their heads out of their collective ass and put country first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🙏🏻🤞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree. I tweeted earlier I am more convinced that meddling DID affect the outcome of the 2016 election even though we were told it didn’t. Can you imagine how pissed people would be to find out that was the case and it was hidden from us? 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh  no. I’m wondering how many others are having the problem. I guess I’m pretty lucky. It would be nice if there was a way to contact #Twitter so they could resolve it. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am no longer confident that the 2016 election was on the up and up. We were programmed to believe any interference did NOT affect the outcome. Really? Think about it. Fix was probably in way back then. It's probably pre-determined even now. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes!!!! Soon!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrDenaGrayson @DeptofDefense @realDonaldTrump @thespybrief He’s really making America great again isn’t it? 😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‘That’s a bombshell, that’s an earthquake’: NBC reporter sounds the alarm on Russia’s latest efforts for Trump  https://t.co/aoLR0yViXO<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff @HunterJCullen Please #RepSchiff  do something. If true does this not warrant Immediate action?  We have not heard any Democrat come out and expressed anything about this. Very discouraging and worrisome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still having problems?? Omg.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, I’m disappointed that no major Democrat, or any Democrat that I’m aware of, has spoken out on this. My fear is this is going to be downplayed and disappear. Where the hell is everybody? Every state should have paper ballots only for primaries and elections for starters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MSNBC reporting that #Bloomberg  has put $464 MILLION dollars so far in his campaign. 😵😳 On one campaign that’s basically just starting. I have a hard time wrapping my mind around that kind of money. Wow 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhilEhr @realDonaldTrump Does this not necessitate impeachment inquiry???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you’re talking about this Russia interference in our election story, I’m totally with you and am outraged that nobody, especially in the Democratic Party is saying anything. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#RussianCollusion  Seriously, has any DEM spoken about this yet???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheFreshBrew @KamalaHarris @realDonaldTrump But then Mitch will probably "Grapple" with the word suggest. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. I’m just so upset right now because this is such a major story. With an election in a few months, somebody better do something. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Russia Remember,#Mueller told us Russia was interfering last year. Also,  last I heard #MoscowMitch it’s not allowing any kind of election security votes. And nobody does anything? We just wait for the fall? 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where’s #Lindsay and #Rand and #Cruz and the Republican outrage?? 😡 this really pisses me off hearing the story. It sounds unbelievable, but I fear it’s going to be played down and/or basically ignored. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TearsInHeaven09 @chucktodd @MSNBC You have more patience than I do. I never watch him. Once I heard this Russia story I did quickly turn and felt forced to watch him, but luckily it was almost over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has ANY Dem (Pelosi, Schumer...any Dem) spoken about this?? If something is not done now, then Democrats have no room to bitch when the election was stolen from us by the commander and thief. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/HBjUzhAjls<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#RussiaElectionInterference  So, paper ballots are a must OR we never will believe/trust results of election if 45 wins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#RussiaElectionInterference  Is THIS not worth another impeachment hearing? Does everyone keep silent and let 45 ruin us? This just pisses me off. I can't imagine ANY other President getting away with this sh*t. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WTF. Somebody’s got to do something now. 😡What? We’re going to wait to the election until after the fix is in and we’re screwed? Rs will do nothing. Democrats, media grow a pair. Speak the f**k up. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am not cool with it at all. Why the hell can’t somebody do anything about it.  Is the election fix already in the bag?  Republicans probably won’t do a damn thing but the Democrats and the media can speak the hell up. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is anyone listening to these new poll results on on #MSNBC?  In WI/MI and other states very tight races but 45 ahead. I have an extremely hard time believing polls can be that close in so many states. WTAF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this is not being reported why? It was confirmed that the president made another quid pro quo and that’s OK right? 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Zero<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaPainUSA I was thinking within the next couple hours or does he have to wait til #Stone is actually in jail?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thank you #AOC. 🖐👌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ElectionDelegates. So, am I correct in concluding that the Dem ppl can vote for a candidate who wins ppl vote BUT Dem delegates/superdelegates supersedes can that vote? Not fair at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#RogerStone, So, can #Trump pardon him today, right after he's sentenced? Or does he have to wait until he actually goes to prison?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes! That’s exactly what it seems like they’re doing. 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I totally agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yup! She was a badass. 😉👌🖐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Warren<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet if it were a man talking that way to a candidate like that chances are the same pundits would find it acceptable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Warren<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s just what I was wondering. I don’t know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DemDebate. What are those people shouting just as #Biden started to speak?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DemDebate. I have a feeling a lot of the media will be disappointed at #Bloombergs poor performance. In my opinion, I think they were hoping he would stop #Bernie. Didn’t work<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DemDebate   They seem to be skipping #Sanders the second half.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. I do too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree. Sounds so logical<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know, she’s having him for lunch. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha. Great way to put it. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DemDebate  #Biden not so great tonight imo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DemDebate so happy to see the two women feisty and speaking out. They have to, because the attention was going to the men.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#DemDebate too bad #CTodd is a moderator. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DemDebate. I’ve never heard #Bloomberg speak for any length before tonight. Thus  far, he’s not very charismatic. Sort of dry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DemDebate. Wow,  #Bloomberg and #Bernie getting attacked at the onset.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree.  🙄Almost as if they’re re following orders to give him a boost. 😡After all, he is media. Probably medias choice. Yea, a billionaire white guy. Gee, I wonder where his interests would lie. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👌🤞👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Debate.  Go #HarryReid, talking up women.  It’s about time. 👌👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#VegasDebate. So, who’s gonna watch?  I sure hope to see #Warren and #Klobuchar do well. Not too crazy about the billionaire tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilmsgs1 Ha ha  So, doesn't it make sense that the media would be thinking, "This guy is for us?" Thus, giving him a huge media push?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha 😂😂😂. I know. Ewwwww but that is funny. Gross, but funny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AskBloomberg Does anyone know if he owns and/or contributes to any media outlets?  I’m suspicious because suddenly it seems they are all defending, backing,and encouraging ppl to vote for him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, it’s time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So let me get this straight, the debate is tonight?  So when’s the #WarrenTownhall, tomorrow?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn’t #Assange jailed in another country? The US could only pardon him for crimes against US no??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am wondering if this story has been confirmed. Why? Because if true you’d think it would be a major story. Our President involved in hacking election coverup? With another election coming in 8 months. WTF! Os nothing sacred to our country anymore? Have we lost ALL dignity? 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maddow Correct me if wrong, but if true isn’t  this another impeachable offense? Or do we let it slide because he got away with other impeachment offenses &amp;why bother OR let it slide because it’s election year &amp; “let the ppl decide.” 😡I have to remind myself THIS prez is above the law<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She probably will be the only one to cover it. 🙄 I’ve been gone all morning, has any cable or regular news outlet covered it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg!  😳How come these caucus organizers seem so inept? I know the workers work hard but isn’t there anyone who double checks what seems to end up being major problems with these caucuses?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I didn’t know about either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks. I knew about the debate but not the townhall. I look forward to it. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahhh I didn’t know that. It would make a difference. Then again, I’d want to know what he did about it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dogstar7tweets Yea I know. Sexual assault and sexual harassment are not the same BUT 60 sexual harassment’s?  😳That still matters. 😡 I agree John, not much vindication. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So how many allegations are there???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👍👌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You are likely correct. It all comes down to money. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bjoewolf ALL the Dems in the poll beat#Trump but msm picks/chooses...bias to older white men it seems. 😡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Trump would be totally for getting ppl off who are in jail for crimes that enriched them. That's his specialty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthewamiller I forgot about him. He may very well be next.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I haven’t even heard them report this story. I just read it on line. It’s unbelievable. No outrage? Wtf 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DianeWziontka @geegeebythesea I have not heard this story on #MSNBC at all. Gee, I wonder if they’d cover it if #PBO had made that comment?  Hell yes!! 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rudy?? Avenatti?  😂🙄God knows it’ll be a #Trump lapdog.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh you can be sure. Everything  #Trump does, he does for himself. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He just said today that he “was the chief law enforcer” in the country. What the flying f**k?? 😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG 😳😡And this is ok?  Where’s the outrage?? Donald Trump: ‘I’m actually, I guess, the chief law enforcement officer of the country’  https://t.co/hUGnI2eEps<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly  It's a scam.  I got a call saying there was a warrant out for my arrest for not paying my taxes. Scammers try to scare elderly out of their money. If you can, block the call.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m hearing now on #MSNBC of a group originating in LA, called #SwingLeft Encouraging Ds to vote for Dem nominee, whomever it is. They’re organized, plan to travel states. Now has over a million ppl who signed on. Great idea IMHO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope you’re right. The #BernieorBust and also the #NeverBernies could both ruin it for Dems if they don’t vote for nominee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, why all the spin as tho only one candidate can beat Trump? They ALL can and if Dems vote for nominee, it’ll happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know. Such a minor thing. 😡🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m guessing pardons also coming for #Stone and #Manafort. Hell, if DT is ever convicted he’d pardon himself because this is the new America now. THIS Pres can do ANYTHING he wants. 😡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Bloomberg If he’s the nominee I’ll vote for him BUT damn, I really don’t want a billionaire in charge. The MSM does tho. That’s all they are talking about. The guy hasn’t even Debated yet. 🙄IMO they want to shove #Bernie out (I’m a #Warren supporter btw)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg!!!! 😳You poor thing.  Take care of yourself. I sincerely hope you get well soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Republicans have always had a problem handling the truth. It’s foreign to them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BoycottBoltonsBook.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennaForTruth You’re wrong. #PBO is right. 😉 God, I miss him. 😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t know either I heard earlier he could be impeached but we know the lapdogs will never do that. Don’t know if #Barr has a breaking point in which his integrity/legacy matter to him but all this certainly doesn’t make him look good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MamaTriedHoney Well, after sterilizing the entire White House. I’d take down every  picture of #Trump and hang a picture of #PBO in every room. Oh, and for sure hang copy of #PBOs Noble Peace Prize. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ll never buy the book. He chose money over country<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yup!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AND he’s stealing money from military (and has eyes set on SS/Medicare to pay for his stupid wall that he kept boasting Mexico would pay for. He opens his mouth..he LIES 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s fine by me but I’d also like to see #KHarris as VP. 🤔Tho she’d be an excellent AG too. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Happy Presidents’ Day #PresidentBarackObama. We sure miss a great President. 😢❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn’t that blasphemy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, is it just me or is the media going overboard with #Bloomberg? As I understand he hasn’t even qualified for next debate. Does he own/support big media? Maybe that’s why they’re salivating at the idea of him running. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not free but I have no problem with medicare for all. I think ppl would like it once they had it. My premiums are lower than ins. from work and coverage is good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly and you also have to get a supplemental or Medicare advantage because Medicare only covers $70 (or 80%). A monthly amount (tho not huge) comes out of my SS check. Yes we pay into it our entire working lives. We EARNED it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perfect name for #Trump perfume, “A Night In The Sewer.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have not given up on #Warren and also like #Klobuchar. It would be great to finally have a woman President. 👍All that being said, I'll vote for whomever wins nomination.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FOX9 That’s pretty amazing no? 😳In one week?  I wish media would pay more attention to women candidates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cockroach Day!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that’s good to know. I mailed mine last week.  I’ll check on it. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hell yea. I remember Rs trashing #PBO here on Twitter when he went golfing. They’d say “taxpayers shouldn’t pay for his golfing.”How about when family traveled somewhere via plane..same thing, Rs bitch about cost. NOW it’s ok? Bullsh*t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh no!!!!MyGod, there’s gotta be a better way. Wtf! Do they  Not check these things out way before caucus?  Just Have paper ballot votes. To hell will cacuses 🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is great. Everyone check it out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hell yes!  If he really did shoot someone on 5th Ave. they’d defend him too and probably blame the Dems 🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@R_C_McG You guys, check this out!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How creepy is that?  An “Omen” perhaps? 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even if there is laws against it, Laws don’t apply to #Trump. 😡🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg 😳 🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lil Cracker.😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s genius.  So accurate. 👍👌Kudos to whomever wrote the lyrics.  Great job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True. Many have indicated if their candidate doesn’t win, they’ll not vote or “write in.”  That could screw us big time. 😡😢Hopefully it won’t happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“Genital herpes” hu? Man, that’s the epitome of unpopularness. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dems as usual do NOT bring this up enough. They should talk about it at every interview and bring it up all debates. They should also shout out that Rs want to mess with SS/Medicare. This s/b be an automatic topic. 🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I find that had to believe. Then again, it’s Alabama. Isn’t 5hat totally Red?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a matter of fact, I worry that if #Biden is nominee, election could go to 45, in spite of what polls show now. I don’t know if he has the “ummph” (sp) 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Conservative drops mic on complicit press trying to maintain access to Trump: ‘He’s a raving lunatic … tell it like it is’  https://t.co/KHfDdFF82X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Master of false news gives right-wing Americans headlines they believe  https://t.co/J6ALBRpRGU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of my all time favorite songs. 👌👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best of luck. I hope you win. 🤞👍🙏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🙄🙄🙄😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I haven’t given up on Liz. Yet,any of the nominees are way better than what we have now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She sounds drunk 😵<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He looks dazed and confused 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahhh I see....thus your vote to acquit DT. 🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, he’s not wrong. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, if it was close to where I live<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. I remember that well. And then #Kelly refused to apologize. 😡I don’t care if he’s military brass or not...he’s an ass. No respect for him at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha 😂😂Only in his demented “little” mind. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MSNBC reporting “unconfirmed” story that #Bloomberg is considering #HRC as his VP running mate. 😳She wouldn’t would she? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha!!!!😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can you imagine if it was a Dem?  He’d have been forced to resign way before this point. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha!!  Well, you must admit, with his record now, he’d fit right in With current Rs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So,  does he get his pension now? Didn’t they make sure they let him go so he wouldn’t get it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MichaelAvenatti  Well,  I guess he had his 15 minutes of fame. I was kind of impressed with him and yet, in the end, not totally surprised of the charges.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awww. I’m sorry for you. I can’t imagine losing my Mitzy, my best friend. 😢. Hang in there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/LSBIGGrwek<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha #Trump saying something idiotic? How odd. 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🖐I’ve heard more than enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The public determined that long ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t insult a POS. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg! I actually agree with #MichaelSteele. 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well then, that settles that doesn’t it? 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha ha 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do You really think he’s gonna make any revelations? Hell no. He’s likely discussed with 45 what to say. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bill Barr’s gambit was ‘carefully staged’ to keep the Justice Department doing Trump’s bidding: Ex-RNC chairman  https://t.co/bJ21VmEYEL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope Dems are smart enough to campaign using this ad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hell no!!! 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right!!! I’m not buying it. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, he’s proud of his obstruction. Remember when he said he told #PBO that nothing would pass. Thus, #MerrickGarland.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plus, all or most,polls show all major candidates beat #Trump. I don’t know why media keeps pushing the electability issue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I say bullshit. Perhaps when #Barrs a** is on the line, he’ll cave but for now I think the con continues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. Just a ploy. Just like his testimony will be a ploy of some kind. He won’t be very forthcoming IMO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too little, too late<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course, because of King Trump says so, it must be the case 😡🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone else sense that the media is now pushing for #Bloomberg? I love some of ads bashing 45, but still can't help but feel he's buying his way to being elected. Will vote for him if he wins, but NOT my choice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am sure she’s very “concerned.”  🙄Her opinion is uselessness. We all know her by now. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So when will you resign? 🙏🏻🤞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ll believe it when I see it. I picture him pleading the fifth or ex privelege. I just doubt he’ll tell all. It’ll be a scam. 😡🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, that’s a good one.  😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha. Yes it is very “disturbing.” 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#KamalaHarris for AG. 👌👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The republicans have also blocked ALL election safeguard proposals.  Gee, I wonder why? 🤔It might be rigged even now for all we know  😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ll Believe it when I see it. Bet he has something up his sleeve like “I’ve been ordered not to discuss by 45.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#HouseJudiciaryCommittee  Call me skeptical, but I have a hard time believing #Barr will actually testify. I'm guessing he'll proclaim ex. Privilege or something<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@44mmvvpp Why do we have to wait that long? 🙄🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unlike #Trumps language right?  🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Are you saying that #Trump can’t have his way if judge says so? What about executive order? Plus, can’t he pardon whoever he wants?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He’ll probably plea the 5th or executive privilege. Don’t get your hopes up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ya think? 🙄Did anyone really think he’d change? I think not. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate that he says “The Military has them now. Let the military deal with them.” Like they’re criminals. WTF 😡They are being punished for telling the truth. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wa wa wa, you big baby.  🙄You made your bed, now lay in it. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🖐And THIS Republican Party is the most corrupt/Complacent  in history as well. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good point.  A lot of spineless people working in our government aren’t there?  😡🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer Yes they ARE responsible. I think they knew he wouldn’t change but didn’t care. Actually IMO, it could be categorized as traitorous putting party before country. Shame on ALL of them.   😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But I m sure they’ll all learn a lesson. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We may see just how beholden the military is to #Trump. They kiss his a**? Do not be surprised. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NHprimary2020  Looks like #Sanders may win NH. Sorry to see #Warren not doing well; but happy to see #Klobachur in 3rd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MichaelBennett drops out of race.  (Not a shocker) #MSNBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought constitution says Congress had to approve war?  Right?  Watch, this President can do absolutely anything...all with an ok from the Republicans. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yea right. 🙄. Because he always tells the truth, right? 🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It would seem so. I wonder if any Republican is outraged/worried/cares at all. Oh wait! What am I thinking? Duh! Republicans are not capable of any of those things. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MSNBC is reporting that now three out of the four prosecutors in the #RogerStone case have resigned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WHY? Do they give a reason for their logic? Or is the obvious reason, that they want Russian interference so Republicans win. Isn’t that the reality of it?😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree. #AliVelshi did just cover it just now. Again, where is the outrage. We all know he’s not gonna get jail time right? Because whatever 45 service goes. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Works for me. Totally fitting. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ViewsPlusNews @PreetBharara And of course we all know if Obama did this nobody would say anything right?😡🙄 Will any decent Republican, if any exist, open their damn mouth? Don’t hold your breath 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who’s surprised? 🙄  https://t.co/PUXS4aQvcs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You had a rally? Hmmm Hadn’t heard. Busy keeping up with the Dems.<|endoftext|>
