<|startoftext|>@Albion2All A goal Regis scored there about 78/79 in a Baggies win - Man City supporters who were there that day talked about what a magnificent goal it was for years!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RICHARD_NATH4N Its a cunning plan.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@STIGUCD @robertmdaws @WBA China I think. Taken on the tour!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SafiyaOutlines @baggiedave70 @P4ulG87 OK but I'm not sure how you think Gallagher would have stopped a cross that Gayle (not the tallest player) beat defenders to a cross to get an unchallenged header in? "What ifs &amp; buts" doesn't hide the fact we didn't hurt a very poor Newcastle side....at all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SafiyaOutlines @baggiedave70 @P4ulG87 You have to score a goal or two to get a point when you're shipping 2.5 against a game!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies @P4ulG87 I watched MoTD last night &amp; the speed with which all teams go forward is stunning compared to our laboured &amp; ponderous "one pass forward - two passes back" approach! We're light years off being good enough at this level!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@P4ulG87 Fair enough - opinions are personal &amp; I respect your view - but I don't think the fact that he had a "silly" budget &amp; apparently, wouldn't have blown most of it on bringing in Grady, was all down to him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies @P4ulG87 Don't disagree but the whole thread was about shuffling the available options as if that would solve it! Fact is, imho, this is the worst squad we have had in PL since 2002! That's a shocking indictment of how Lai's ownership has wrecked what we'd built up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@P4ulG87 I think we all know we needed to invest more in squad than we did - but the fact we didn't isn't going to change any time soon! Fact is the whole squad is mainly championship quality  &amp; ain't going to hack it in PL however you shuffle it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@P4ulG87 What's your point? You want Bilic sacked? Or you're blaming him for poor signings? Or you blaming him for shit owners who have invested nothing in building a PL squad? Or you're blaming him for match tactics or team selection? #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@P4ulG87 Yes - up till lockdown we were good to watch &amp; playing well - then we never really got it back - but it was in the Championship with second tier players that we thought could perform in PL &amp; that's a different ball game! Not good enough at this level!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@P4ulG87 There needs to be with probably just 6 points at Christmas....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baggiedave70 @P4ulG87 Exactly the point! Nothing changes that whichever 11 start!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@P4ulG87 Yep - but you "can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear!" - maybe he is getting the best out of his squad now &amp; they are what they are!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@P4ulG87 Doesn't really matter how you rearrange the deckchairs on the Titanic when the ship is sinking! Realistically, we need new blood all over the pitch &amp; that isn't going to happen! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Our jobs and future depend on a deal, business warns Boris Johnson"  https://t.co/JPp4taX4ju<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie No goals in the side at all! Loads of possession but no final ball or finish!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett Quite! Dead men walking - at all levels at the moment!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No disrespect to Newcastle, but they are the worst team we've faced this season, imho, &amp; still we weren't good enough! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You really shouldn't let Gayle beat you in the air to a header! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Playing with more width, stretching them more &amp; getting in behind their defence! Much better tactically! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thats an excellent finish! Now take confidence from it! Game's there to be won! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Newcastle are so ordinary but we really aren't causing them any problems at all! We are so slow &amp; ponderous in our build up &amp; then give ball away - style of play just doesn't  "hurt" teams! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crying out for a Yacob or Mulumbu type player to sit in front of this back 4! The balance/mix in this line up is all wrong! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie Quite  - it didn't work last week, why would it be any better this time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that started well! What a shambles! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke @phoenixbaggie @WBA Smarty pants....stop boasting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshesVictory @TheVan Losing the will......never understand why Baggies need to make things so complicated!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brynbaggie @WBA Not that bothered either but so many made a big deal about being called, some 2 or 3 times it seems, but there were loads they missed, so it was all a bit hit &amp; miss! A bit like now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nick_wba @TheVan One....or both? Are they different? I've looked on website now &amp; read what it says so don't need it again! But thanks anyway!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVan Yep - I've always been a masochist where Baggies are concerned.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nick_wba @TheVan You're getting mine then....!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Heidi_wba @ehayward93 To be quite honest, entering the ballot &amp; missing out might be a "win" at the moment!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ And wasn't that always the danger? Habit &amp; football go together! I missed Saturday games 9 months ago but I'm used to it now! Don‚Äôt know if I'll ever get back to the commitment I once had....or if I'm even bothered any more!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Baggiepat Really don't want Bowyer! Owners don't put serious money into team building, then blame manager for failure to achieve - then go for cheap option replacement! Really don't like how this is shaping up! #wba<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Cornish_Damo Can anyone who wanted "our freedom" from the EU explain exactly what changes that would deliver for the better for them? Do any of those people want to comment on what they see as the benefits of a #NoDealBrexit? #BorisHasFailedTheNation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny what you suddenly remember - Christmas shopping with my grandmother at #Bratts in #Northwich in late50's/early60's &amp; having lunch there - then the single decker #NorthWestern bus back to her home in #Hartford! Happy days! #Nostalgia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tomorrow,  Saturday 3.00pm kick off! Is this the end of civilisation as we know it! Hard to believe Baggies are involved in this! Now just want a Saturday 3.00pm ko with me in my usual seat! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ Yes but "he's funny so we'll let him decide our futures...!" was the mantra this time last year! Frightening where this idiot &amp; his lapdog cronies are taking us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Negotiation is about finding common ground, compromise, being flexible &amp; achieving a "win/win" acceptable to both parties!

<|startoftext|>@lydia_sloan7 Yep - never in doubt in my mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SlashWilko @ChristoClifford Had it for last 5 years - no problems at all - relax!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StigsWBACousin He should actually be singing "Big Bad George" cos that shower yesterday need to find some "attitude!" Rolling over when the going gets tough isn't acceptable!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies Quite - losing an attacking player shouldn't have had such a devastating effect on our defending. As you rightly say, just go tighter &amp; narrower &amp; frustrate the opposition! Break on the counter when opportunities arise! Tactically very poor coupled with some lousy performances!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chaz_wba Several bottles needed......!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spikeoss666 @bazabaggie73 @gavin_poulton Yep - I agree - without a massive turnaround soon he can't survive much longer! Thing is, without major investment, this squad is what any successor has to work with!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReynoldsRambles Have to say in my 60+ years as a Baggie - Valencia was one of the absolutely outstanding highlights &amp; today was up there with the most abject of absolutely appalling performances! Your observation is spot on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bazabaggie73 @gavin_poulton Looking for his bike? Sad times, he's a decent man - is he doing the best with the hand he's been dealt or is he just not up to it? Its a question from me - not a judgement! Genuinely don't know what the answer is!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ONONERON Don't tempt me....question now is, is one bottle enough?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSock @baggiedave70 Silk purses &amp; sows ears isn't it! Championship squad in PL always going to struggle without major investment! We spent what we had on players we had in Championship + freebies &amp; loans! We didn't "raise our bar" &amp; now we're seeing the consequences! Not up to it at this level!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshBurty @bfatchett I agree - think Bilic input to how club spent in summer was very limited! Think Dowling had final word on who we signed! Bilic kept saying he was "disappointed" by lack of funds &amp; choice of who was available to us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoldbergRadio The total capitulation was what was worrying - even with 10 men, were still competing at half time! Went 2-1 down &amp; collapsed! No character, no leadership, no belief!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rjdowning Lol - he'd have split loyalties for that one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rjdowning Quite - worrying isn't it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonpaulbates Agree - Jenkins jumped ship this summer cos he saw what was just round the corner! For all his shortcomings, he was a safe pair of hands at the helm!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie I don't disagree! Horses for courses - Gibbs is a left back, start him over Phillips every time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getpromotionpr Absolutely! You've summed it up perfectly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not advocating it, but I'd say Bilic will be gone before next game! Its what owners do when they've lost the plot - &amp; this lot have! #laiout #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie Awful! A total mess! Pereira dismissal has no effect on the shocking performance from everyone else!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is now the 3rd worst defeat home defeat I've ever seen since I saw my first game in 1955! So no bollocks from the apologists with excuses please! This is utter junk! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett Worrying times - this is a club in serious decline without a change of direction/ownership very quickly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This team has no character, no leadership - I don't won't happy clappers telling me to get behind the team now - but the problem isn't the squad, who are what they are, Championshipat at best, or Bilic, who works with what he's given - but the problem is appalling owners! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shambles! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The worrying thing here is Palace aren't very special! But were a total mess - another man doesn't really make a lot of difference! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gemmadowneswba Bit small! ü§£üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nick_wba I'm on it!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The big decision this half is....do I have another whisky or not? #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie Hugh Johns - Gerald Sinstadt! Happy days!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie Better days, better times imho! Football is destroying itself at the top level for me! It should be about passion, commitment &amp; not micro-scutiny of every moment of controversy! Becoming sterile &amp; pointless!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sal_Wba I turn the sound down so low I just about hear the background noise but not the "commentary!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie Norman Hunter, Nobby Stiles, "Chopper" Harris would never have finished a game!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm afraid these #VAR replays, whether right or wrong, are ending my relationship with #PL football! Over scrutiny of everything doesn't enhance the experience! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray Yep - I'm usually wrong on most things!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thats another great finish - this lad is a bit special! We're lucky to have him! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joekapalo Don't disagree with that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joekapalo They don't need coaching....they never see the the ball....! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@junes_mr Well we might put two in our own goal......!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie Yep but it helps if its at the other end!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too early to be negative but....I don't see us scoring twice......! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been out walking the dog to make the wait go quicker, so only just got in &amp; seen team! Think it looks very positive &amp; clearly looking for the win - especially the bench with its  attacking options! #coyb #wba<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StigsWBACousin I wouldn't ridicule that view - I think we are improving &amp; some players are growing into PL &amp; looking able to compete! If we score enough goals, we'll stay up cos not conceding so many now! Same for SheffU - short on goals but still can play at bit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HEREFORD10 Lol - not quite....but I made inroads! The joys of following the Baggies!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@folkev You can't really make a bad choice - I had 12yo last night, which is great, but none will let you down!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adriansewell53 Yep - I don't often get it right.....! But I'm happy with that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkOknee Did you spell that right.....? ü§£üëå<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@poppacotty Absolutely right - balances out over a season! We could've lost that, we didn't! We could've beaten Chelsea &amp;  should've got points against ManU, Spurs , we didn't! Results are the only thing that gets remembered I'm content!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ Yes but ultimately he didn't!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ Outstanding performance from Sam - again! One or two who struggled in earlier games starting to look they may cut it in PL! Encouraging!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WBAinDE I think on another day they'd probably have put one or two of their chances in, to be fair. We weren't bad, but we've played better &amp; lost this season &amp; Sam was outstanding! But result is what matters!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well the result goes in the record books as a 1-0 win, but really we got out of jail there! Could prove massive if we can take confidence from it &amp; win at home again next week! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where has 7 minutes come from?!! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SafiyaOutlines Yep - need to step it up a bit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie That's the worry isn't it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't think 1-0 win be enough here! Hope I'm wrong, but we'll probably start going deeper &amp; deeper the longer this goes on &amp; handing them more possession! Second goal would take pressure off! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noseybstard Lol....o ye of little faith!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noseybstard No - but having his best games of season so far in everything else imho.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies @boing_baggies Not getting a win in any of games against Burnley, Fulham &amp; Brighton &amp; only scoring 1 goal was very worrying really cos those are the games that matter in terms of points if struggling!

<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies @boing_baggies Trouble is, we're always likely to give one away so we need to score to get anything &amp; we just don't look threatening enough! I agree - Grant is too isolated to be effective! Lonely up top at Baggies!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies @boing_baggies Sadly I agree!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An increasingly bad case of party/politics before people! No principles at all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies @boing_baggies Yep - I don't disagree, but don't think anything will happen quick enough to save our season!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lichnomadscc Lol - I'd probably peg out! üòÑüòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boing_baggies Don't see it happening quickly &amp; we can write it off for this side of January window! So no impact on this season at all!

<|startoftext|>My eldest daughter wrote, co-directed &amp; performed (the mother) in this short, award nominated, film - it covers serious #mentalhealth issues in a sensitive &amp; sympatgetic way - if you have half an hour, give it a view. #newwriting #localtalent   https://t.co/wJaxDSYUwp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sparra06_ @WBA1878 @Lott777 @JPercyTelegraph Quite - all speculation &amp; if it isn't resolved before the next window closes it will be too late to make any investment in players this season, so unlikely to provide a quick fix!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WBA1878 @Lott777 @Sparra06_ @JPercyTelegraph Yep - any owners are a risk but I agree Lai needs to sell &amp; he seems to have reached that conclusion too! We were never safer than when club was owned by local people &amp; fans &amp; no one person could own more than 30% of shares - it was Peace who changed all that, not for the better!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WBA1878 @Lott777 @Sparra06_ @JPercyTelegraph Scudamore was my guess too! Very high profile &amp; fits the description, doesn't he! Not sure how highly I rate him, but he's certainly "experienced!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sparra06_ @Lott777 @JPercyTelegraph Bit different though to managing a club - lots of "experienced" managers aren't that good but the potential buyers seeking advice &amp; guidance before buying is my point really - not who it is! Suggests they want a football club for football, not just an investment addition!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewPolitics67 @Mike78894815 @Conservatives Be interesting to know how many use a "funny handshake" &amp; if they know the judge does too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lott777 @Sparra06_ @JPercyTelegraph Doesn't really matter who owns us if they're just adding to their business portfolio, which some investors do! However, I find the bit about "being advised by someone with a wealth of PL experience" encouraging, since it appears to show some "due diligence" by interested party!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WbaFormer Lovely memories of him in my early days as a Baggie - talented  player in a decent side we had then! Affectionately known as "Cowboy" by a lot of fans - he was a bit bandy legged!  RIP Maurice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ @M_Star_Online Quite - self inflicted, poor decision making &amp; now pleading poverty!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@M_Star_Online Perhaps I'd feel a bit more sympathy if they weren't paying Bale, for instance, ¬£600k a week - thats ¬£30m plus a year on wages for one player!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidKe30081373 @GoldbergRadio Quite - I'm my opinion offside should be determined by where the "offending" players feet are - not by the fact they might be leaning forward a bit more or have their arm forward!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies @GoldbergRadio Exactly - as fans have for years - the subject of much debate in the pub Sunday lunchtime... "the ref was a w...er!" But that was football &amp; we got over it! Microscopic scrutiny is counter productive!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoldbergRadio Trouble is what VAR shows is, mostly, still open to interpretation by those watching it, so an  "opinion" of what was seen decides! Different people have different opinions, so it will still be controversial! Instant decisions are less controversial, even if not always right imo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sbaggieboy60 *there* &amp; I'm the first to complain when people get there, their &amp; they're  mixed up! Still - it was auto correct, not me! üòèüòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SafiyaOutlines @GoldbergRadio @chrislepkowski True - but "big spending" in the Championship isn't anywhere near as "big" as the spending in the PL - so its relative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sbaggieboy60 I think a lot who experienced the war shut down their emotions as a defence! Yes, Chatham had a huge military presence, particularly the navel dockyards - had ancestors who worked their as master shipwrights! Visited the museum a few years ago - wonderful place to see!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sbaggieboy60 Great memories - I don't know what set me off thinking about pipe smoke! My grandad eventually had a heart attack &amp; had to stop smoking but he still sucked his pipe with no tobacco in it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaggieinNewport Yep - I think some players just need to "believe" in themselves a bit more &amp; a good result or two would achieve that! We have talent in squad - need more belief!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaggieinNewport Agree totally - not out of place in PL at all...and yesterday I though Bartley &amp;, in particular, Furlong had their best games of the season so far. Performances are better than results show at the moment!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn't it strange what you suddenly think about! Today it's the smell of my grandads pipe smoke in my grandparents house in the late 1950's in Hartford, Cheshire - a warm and comforting aroma that brings back happy childhood memories! #Nostalgia #stbruno<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaggieBirdd66 Yep - I watch Baggies games out of loyalty/habit &amp; no other games at all now! I absolutely despise #VAR, whoever it favours, don't want it anywhere near football! The game is destroying itself!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidKe30081373 Thats exactly my point! Hard luck stories never kept a team up, but goals will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getpromotionpr @WBADyl Yes I agree - not sure what the answer is really unless we find a way to change the system with what we have. Grant spends too much time isolated &amp; needs better support but the 3 at the back with wingbacks has made us tighten up - so its a difficult call getting more up top!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WBADyl *started off....* whoops<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoldbergRadio @chrislepkowski The Championship for me - its about competition &amp; building a side, on limited resources, through skill &amp; clever recruitment! PL success is usually "bought" by rich owners bunging in mega money &amp; isn't a level playing field! Its become sterile &amp; boring! Football needs a "reset!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WBADyl Read the full thread.....I started of by saying "whatever the injustices....." &amp; there were many yesterday, but if we don't score, we don't win - observation of that isn't criticism &amp; I always give credit when deserved &amp; moan when we're crap! Its what fans have always done!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Albion2All Lol - but like I said, bets always come back to haunt me...... so nailed on we'll probably hit 5 &amp; win comfortably! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Albion2All 0-1 to Sheffield - in off Burke's bum in 97th minute after ref added too much stoppage time! Trust me..... ü§£üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Albion2All Confidence is a big thing in football &amp; a couple of wins often turn things round! I felt if we'd hung on &amp; beaten Chelsea, we'd probably have got another win or two by now! Then who knows! There's time to turn it round, but need to start soon otherwise confidence will be shot!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Albion2All I think Grant has goals in him, btw, but isn't getting much service at the moment - did well with his one real chance yesterday &amp; on another day, that could have gone in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Albion2All Of course we'll score goals in the next 30 games - the question is how many &amp; will it be enough to pick up points? Basically if the other team score one at the moment that's it - game over! We played well in last 2 games but still couldn't score, for what ever reason, so lost!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Albion2All Lol - I never bet on the Baggies mate, it usually comes back to haunt me! But realistically, if we don't score in next couple of games (&amp; win them) we're truly up shit creek! Big chance for us coming up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Albion2All You're completely missing the point -  my tweet said "whatever the injustices we haven't got a goal in us" that's a statement of fact currently! As already been said - worse start in 35 years! Its an observation &amp; the reason is we don't score! Hard luck, what if are irrelevant!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Albion2All One goal since September! "Should haves" mean nothing! You could also argue Sam made 3/4 great saves or it could have been a 4-0 defeat! At the end of the day its only the outcome that matters!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markgholloway @Reynox78 There was nothing wrong with the principle "the refs decision is final" - it served football well for over 100 years &amp; wrong decisions "balanced out over a season" - we lived with it &amp; argued in the pub Sunday lunchtime about it - not perfect but better than what we have with VAR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reynox78 @markgholloway Most decisions are still opinions &amp; interpretation though so VAR doesn't decide, it just opens it up to close rescrutiny &amp; increased debate if the decision is changed - whatever is decided, some won't agree!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markgholloway @Reynox78 Quite - that's my concern! Cricket seem to have it about right! Replay decisions there are accepted without controversy &amp; LBW, for instance, is a decision based on interpretation/opinion as much as giving a penalty!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reynox78 @markgholloway The inconsistencies still are there &amp; that's what VAR was supposed to eliminate! I'd rather have the ref call what he thinks he sees &amp; sometimes call it wrong!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markgholloway @Reynox78 That's what really hurts - deserved something from both games &amp; got nothing! Get stuffed 4-0 and hey ho! But last 2 games defeats are really sickening!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lazydave68 Absolutely! Thought it was a clear penalty &amp; he called it right first time! Think pressure from some Utd players made him think again! Weak referee!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reynox78 Yes  - I agree - worked their socks off &amp; the outcome would probably have been totally different if our penalty had stood! Utd penalty, fair enough - a matter of judgment, but probably wouldn't have happened if we'd been given ours first!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bottom line is....whatever the injustices tonight, we just don't have a goal in us &amp; since we don't keep clean sheets, we'll continue to struggle. #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stevotop @WBA VAR was supposed to remove controversial decisions &amp; bring in fairness - every week its littered with more debate about was VAR right or wrong! Its increased controversy &amp; alienated supporters! Hardly progress! #VAR #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnTheBagtist Corrupt sums it up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a f.......g joke football has become! The "star" of this game is this dickhead masquerading as a referee! #wba #VAR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thats an absolute disgrace! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think this ref deserves a job in government - totally bent! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@magneticsparrow I've just opened the Glenmorangie!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ethanhunt1961 Exactly  - too basic a failing at this level.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just get the feeling if we kept the ball a little better in their half, we could get something here! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshRoberts1988 @WBA @KitCrimes I don't think I've ever seen us play at Old Trafford in anything but blue &amp; white stripes before &amp; I go back a long way - occasionally we've worn dark shirts, not white - but this change today is totally needless!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenBrownWF @corinnebailey To say nothing of free "social housing" x2 in Downing Street &amp; at Chequers as a perk of the job!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@corinnebailey @StephenBrownWF He's avoiding #PritiPatelBullying by staying in isolation! And don't forget, he doesn't have Dominic now to tell him what to say! Must be tough at the top!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PapaRoppa77 @maisie2shooz @GUNKLE2 Lol - short, accurate &amp; straight to the point! You win my tweet of the day! üëåü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PsychosisSafari What I find remarkable is the fact her defense is no one told her she was acting like an obnoxious prat! It shouldn't need pointing out that she's not treating people correctly! It should be natural to treat staff with respect! Sounds a nasty individual to me. #PritiPatel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyInBanstead @iammorty @symmo1969 @johnmcdonnellMP You know nothing of the job I had, nor the background to that, so don't judge or presume! But when I comes to government funding &amp; how it operates I would back my knowledge &amp; experience over yours!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@symmo1969 @AndyInBanstead @iammorty @johnmcdonnellMP Quite - absolutely correct &amp; sadly, its a concept that is totally lost on most people who try to compare their understanding of conventional finance with government funding/spending.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyInBanstead @iammorty @symmo1969 @johnmcdonnellMP Very naive of you! I worked in Ministers offices during my long civil service career &amp; I can assure virtually every Minister that ever lost his job at an election left a sarcastic note for his successor! You clearly know little of government traditions &amp; even less of govt finance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Bet that was fun! As if it isn't a big enough pain without extra problems!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus - hope your move went ok? Can't think of anything more stressful than moving house!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baggie_ade @mark_rollason I didn't say they were underspending either - I said there was an argument that more govt spending was a better way out of an economic problem like we have than enforcement of austerity by government imposing public spending cuts, which is what Tory governments inevitably do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisjdownes @NatMansell @bartelbee23 Quite - frightening isn't it but "Boris is funny &amp; I like him &amp; Corbyn is a Marxist so we don't want that!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NatMansell @bartelbee23 I remember, under Thatcher, my pay went up, over a period, by about 4% - the private sector went up by 26% - official figures! The public sector never does as well as the private sector - its the same now! Public sector pay is also on a lower base to start with!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyway....f**k politics &amp; the mess the world is in....our dog (Jess) is whinging for her afternoon walk...so "she who must be obayed" rules...time to go out! #dogsoftwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NatMansell Quite - I worked in public sector all my working life because I valued what I did - had I been mercenary &amp; sold my soul to the highest bidder, I could have earned a lot more in private sector! How was my loyalty rewarded? I was constantly screwed on pay by governments!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HEREFORD10 @baggie_ade @mark_rollason Its an easy hit for government, Simon - public sector is always first to suffer! Meanwhile the CEO's &amp; shareholders at Virgin, Serco &amp; others favoured with government contracts will continue to do very nicely thank you! It stinks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baggie_ade @mark_rollason They're not underspending because there is no limit to what a government can spend - but they're spending it badly to out sourced, "for profit" private providers, without a proper tender process to ensure value for money! Its corrupt &amp; appalling, inefficient use of public money<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iammorty @johnmcdonnellMP Reality I'd say, Gary. My economic beliefs are based on Keynesian principles for government, not one of austerity by choice or default! The "money tree" was a May inspired myth, spin, con, nothing more!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CrockfordPaul @Peston @pritipatel So if I'm done for doing 40mph in a 30mph zone I can say, in defence, I didn't know what the limit was? Simplistic example maybe - but ignorance has never been a defence in law! This government change the rules to suit themselves! #PritiPatel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iammorty @johnmcdonnellMP Judging by the mega billions this government have "spaffed up the wall" funding their dodgy PPE &amp; track &amp; trace contracts with their mates, there is obviously plenty to be shaken off if the will is there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mark_rollason Correct - sadly the country, if not much of the world, has moved a long way to the right in recent years - much of it fostered by the media, which is mainly controlled by billionaires with an agenda!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mark_rollason There is an argument when national finances are struggling government should actually spend more money to stimulate the economy &amp; create employment, which increases spending, demand and delivers growth (Keynes) - sadly the Tory default has always been the opposite - austerity!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mark_rollason Quite! I spent virtually my entire working life since late 60's in Civil Service &amp; EVERY Tory government I worked under brought in a public sector pay freeze at some point! It's what they do &amp; this just had to happen!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lukestokes84 Quite  - Austin may not have 90mins in him now, but late in game when we need a goal he's worth a punt off the bench! Grosicki must have upset Slav in some way!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@magneticsparrow Yes I was pleased with our application, just don't see where goals are coming from!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies Quite - might get away with it in Championship but not in PL. Its why so many decent players in lower leagues can't make it in PL - individual mistakes are punished!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray Its difficult to see where the first win is coming from! We create so little from midfield! Strikers need service &amp; ours get none!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray Yep - I think if we'd held on for the win against Chelsea it could have kick started our season - the confidence boost would have been massive!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PsychosisSafari Yep I don't disagree! Thankless job being a keeper! People always remember the one you don't stop! A striker is always remembered for their goals, not their misses!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidKe30081373 One goal in 5 games is a shocking record &amp; it isn't as if we're even creating chances....we're not!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ We at least tried today but patently not good enough! Just no cutting edge or enough creativity to hurt PL team defences!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stevotop Agree - Fulham was an appalling performance &amp; apart from that game we have at least competed against some decent sides. Trouble is, its the games like Fulham we need points from!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lazydave68 We blew our budget on keeping our championship squad together when what we needed was a quality upgrade in so many areas! I actually think this is the weakest squad we've had in PL &amp; if/when we're relegated, it won't launch a quick promotion challenge again! Worrying!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PsychosisSafari I understand that - I'm an ex keeper who played at a decent level &amp; feel for him cos he isn't a bad keeper, but play in goal &amp; make a mistake, it can cost the game! That's what happened today! He could have saved 3 pens before it, but he'd have been at fault for goal!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stevotop But they did get three points &amp; that's what good teams do when they don't play well! Almost inevitable that we'd concede! Fact is, we never really "hurt" them! Some of our possession is excellent but it doesn't really open teams up or create real chances! Too pedestrian!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PsychosisSafari I praised him for a great save minutes earlier, I'll criticise him for cocking up for the goal! That's football! Every issue on its merits! Playing well this season, which he has, doesn't make him "mistake immune!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bottom line is, we don't score goals &amp; won't keep a clean sheet! Don't pick up many points like that! Battling is fine &amp; commendable, but we need more! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie Championship squad, woefully short at this level - can't blame the players, they tried - but we are no where near good enough to be in PL!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stevotop What did we do except defend?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Backs to the wall for 90 minutes, create very little, battle well, but ultimately a good side will always nick a goal - end of day, we lost! That's all that matters! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Game over! 1-0 would always be enough - #wba<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@terrywoneill I saw the tag end of the great 50's team - Allen, Barlow etc - quality players in any era! But we've always been unpredictable &amp; full of surprises! Fail against the weak &amp; beat the quality! Its in our DNA!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Typical Albion! Absolutely dross against Fulham last week - working their socks off today! Been this way since I saw my first game in late '50's! Its who we are! Never changes! Never predictable! Its why I love them! #Baggies #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Playing ok but you can see we'd probably be really competitive if we'd spent on a bit more on quality in key areas! Still don't really create much! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KentishHack Yes - one I've been hoping to do too! I know they have a huge archive of uncatalogued photos &amp; I'm researching my family history which goes back nearly 400 years in the town!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KentishHack I imagine some exist! I don't know where the Douglas West Collection is stored now, but he &amp; his father photographed everything in Whitstable for years. Maybe the museum has them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KentishHack Always called the backwater when I was a kid - and I remember a man who used to open the sluice gate to empty it into the harbour at low tide....but then I do go back quite along way! üòâ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I find it remarkable that most US states can conclude their count in 24 hours of election day - but those that appear to hold the final result in their hands can't declare after 4 days! "Something Rotten in the State of Denmark?" #USElectionResults2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@YiasontheGreek @JohnSimpsonNews No, but US is a country that thrives on lawsuits &amp; litigation &amp; any sniff of it there &amp; the lawyers would be on it! The fact they aren't suggests it isn't much of an issue!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Writing is probably on the wall when the speculation about who'll take over starts! Next there'll be a board "vote of confidence....!" Followed a few days later by "The club would like to thank....!" All much more predictable than the US Election result! #wbabur<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BaggieBirdd66 @Baggies_Facts Exactly - never understood the need to charge existing subscribers, but it wasn't the tv companies was it! It was PL clubs, including ours, trying to boost income! Backfired a bit!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Quinlan1989 Quite - if PR applied in US, based on individual state votes share, it would be all over now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Quinlan1989 Yes I understand that but the President is a federal Head of collective states &amp; therefore the view of the majority overall should prevail!   Also - one state can be won by one vote but all the college votes go to the winner! Same as first past the post in UK! Hardly democracy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are some strange election processes, UK included, but this US electoral college system is quirky beyond belief!

<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ Awful isn't it! Can't remember if we ever won it it, but do associate it with a shocking time under Gould!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wezzaboing74 @Baggiepat Yes I agree! No team should ever win two headers in the box like that! Third rate defending!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baggiestex @Baggiepat Quite! Its too easy to say now, but I do wonder if Hegazi had been in the team last night, if they'd have conceded that first goal! Just feel he might have got to the cross box ball! We'll never know!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Baggiepat Yep - the second goal really finished us - a great strike - but the first one was the worrying one! Two free, unchallenged headers in the box,  absolutely appalling defending! Parks teams would have been ashamed of that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baggiestex @Baggiepat Yes - Roy of the Rovers tat sums it up nicely....except Roy's teams always came from 8-0 down to get 9 in injury time! We couldn't score in a b.......!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Baggiepat Absolutely - on both points! ü§£üëç<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SafiyaOutlines @ChapmanJ92 I can take it if the players aren't collectively good enough, they are what they are - but I can't take them not "performing" &amp; fighting for the club! Tonight it looked like the latter from too many! Not acceptable!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies Oh come on now..........ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't think we won a 50-50 ball did we? Powder puff performance! No drive, desire or motivation! And, more worryingly, obviously no belief either! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnTheBagtist Agree - tactics all wrong from start! This is worst performance of season  so far, I think, &amp; Fulham are very poor!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One pass forward, two passes back won't create any chances! No cutting "edge", too slow &amp; ponderous getting forward &amp; Grant isolated agsin! Very poor performance all round! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sbaggieboy60 @tpjdavies Yes that's right - never understood why! We were superb against Blues!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett I'd put Gibbs on at halftime! I think Townshend has done well in last few games but he's having a stinker tonight imho!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nick_wba Yep - I think you are probably right!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getpromotionpr Yep - absolutely!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett Tactics all wrong again &amp; most can see that! When he changed it last week, we looked useful - should have started with the line-up that finished!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A mess down the left at the back! This formation doesn't work! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember a #fulwba game, awful match, mid 60's standing on the old open Riverside Terrace at Craven Cottage with my dad &amp; halfway through second half the floodlights packed up! Eventually, some wag says "bad play stopped lights!" ü§£ Hoping for better tonight! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies Funny thing with Gould was, we were great for a time under him, really attacking football, full of goals - then he seemed to get cold feet &amp; completely changed the style &amp; we were awful then!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies Apparently yes! We wore yellow &amp; green before but he thought red was more "intimidating" to opposition! He also believed the world was flat!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Red &amp; yellow tonight! I shudder at the thought cos it reminds me of the Gould years! Please don't call it "iconic!" üò±ü§£ #wba<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RobPaddockWBA Yes - you're right....that would be typical Albion! ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From todays results, it seems a win on Monday would be a massive boost for Baggies! Need to go for a win, no looking for a point! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ @Baggies_Facts Quite...but then so are they! üòâü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ @Baggies_Facts Quite! Mind you, they were a big club when Victoria was still Queen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lefeaverwba If that's away at Leicester. I had a quid on Baggies to win 2-1 at 125-1 &amp; Sneekes to score first goal! I think Raven got the winner in injury time - so I have very happy memories of that game!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Baggies_Facts They generally base the games they put on by potential viewing figures cos that drives what they can charge for advertising, a big earner for them! So games like Fulham/Baggies, low viewing figures, low advertising income! Stick on Monday teatime on PPV! Its all about income!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PDubberley @Stevotop Yes, I'm of that opinion too now! I did hear that the price quoted was actually below what JP actually got with "extras!" But I don't know if it was true or just hearsay! The "due diligence" that went on wasn't about what was best for club, just whether Lai could actually pay up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElaineDyson1 Appalling! A truly decent man being treated like this by the "thug in a suit" who is now Labour leader! This doesn't unite the party, it just divides it even more!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baggiepoint Quite! Either he sold Peace a very convincing story...or he was the top bidder &amp; JP took the money &amp; sold club down the river!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stevotop Quite - think he just saw us as a marketing tool! Sad thing is he convinced JP he was the best deal! Or maybe Jeremy just got top price? We'll never know now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getpromotionpr Palm are also involved in construction projects involved in leisure, building complexes I believe! They had plans to expand &amp; when he bought us  Chinese government were encouraging overseas investment in sports clubs! It was "prudent" at the time, but all that changed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Lai has his price, clearly he no longer has any interest in the club - if he genuinely ever did, apart from a marketing tool in China for Palm! Fine, but meanwhile, we tread water! Hopefully, someone with real ambition shows interest, not just a chancer investor! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ksshuttle An "unenforceable" opposition day debate voted "for" by Tories, would have been a statement of intent &amp; support for FSM!

<|startoftext|>@VillaJohn01 @Theleaguemag Yes, nice chatting with you too! Sleep well! üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VillaJohn01 @Theleaguemag Amazing! Small world! Knew the area like the back of my hand - went everywhere on bikes at a relatively young age! Wouldn't happen now! "I remember when....!" ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VillaJohn01 @Theleaguemag Initially Blackburn Rd - near Highfield Rd/Robin Hood Lane. Then Shirley Rd, by Three Magpies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VillaJohn01 @Theleaguemag Yes - remarkable to think 3 local teams together in semi finals that year! We lived in Hall Green then - so quite near St Andrews - all my mates were Villa or Blues, I was the only Baggie! I remember a different attitude to what we have now. Rivalries, but without the "nastiness"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VillaJohn01 @Theleaguemag Yep - replays will be gone next - which will be a shame! When Villa won cup in 1957 - played Baggies in the semi final, drew &amp; won replay! I was v young but atmosphere round Brum was electric! Played locally at Molyneux &amp; St Andrews! Now its Wembley &amp; extra time! Not the same!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VillaJohn01 @Theleaguemag Sad whats happened to it! 3rd Rd cup day was the biggest day of the season then - the day everyone looked forward to! Now the PL clubs put out weak sides! It's killed the magic! Between 54 &amp; 60, Baggies, Villa &amp; Wolves all won the cup &amp; Blues were finalists! Hey ho! üòü<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VillaJohn01 @Theleaguemag That's when the the Cup still pulled big crowds! I remember as a kid round that time queuing all night for cup tickets &amp; gates of 50000+ were common for cup ties for most clubs, when league games often got half that! Cup was really the "big" competition then!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPridsta Yep - one touch, turn &amp; hit it! Really like the look of him! Natural finisher!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ Got a twitter mate who's a Huddersfield fan &amp; been receiving loads of positive comments about him all through the transfer saga! Sometimes you know instinctively when you first see a player if he's got it! I get that buzz seeing Grant!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamHingley Tactics totally wrong first half - second half we were the better side &amp; unlucky not to win! Shape a lot better when Robbo &amp; Edwards came on! Pleasing overall! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could have won that! Second half transformation was more positive when we got on front foot and "believed!" Moral is....don't start games looking for 0-0! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a strikers finish! Deserve that! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjpatel212 Think the initial game plan is damage limitation - which is negative &amp; usually fatal with our defending! Need to get on front foot &amp; go for it more second half - if we don't, we obviously can't! Big test of tactics now! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Far too predictable &amp; ponderous in build up! No real cutting edge! Grant 30 yds ahead of any supporting players! Brighton have pace &amp; movement that we lack going forward! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bartelbee23 Nudge, nudge, wink wink! Say no more Squire! üòâü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hitendra70 Yes I agree. A subtle balancing act isn't it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hitendra70 Yes I hope so but picking Hegazi last week suggested Hegazi was still very much in Slav's plans, plus his comments a few days ago! No problem selling him but need manager on board too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bartelbee23 I agree! Club thinking seems to have been, get promoted, get relegated again &amp; take another round of parachute payments! Small time thinking from Lai &amp; his "team!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like Slav has been shafted by the club over Hegazi! May have been right to unload but needed to have Bilic on board too! He has to win games or he'll be gone soon &amp; owners will ultimately be responsible! Bit of a mess it seems! Typical Albion, whoever owns club! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@P4ulG87 Always liked Hegazi! Decent player overall. He did make a few mistakes, but he was a ¬£4m player, not ¬£40m, so no complaints about him - we got what we paid for! I think Ajayi is still improving &amp; will be fine, given time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getpromotionpr @StephenBrownWF *he's* - phone doesn't know best!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getpromotionpr @StephenBrownWF Quite - he is totally clueless &amp; not very bright. And people vote for him to be their MP because his the right party candidate where they live!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mark_rollason @tpjdavies Quite! I also remember the outcry when we signed Albiston on a free &amp; paid him ¬£1000 a week! That's only in the 90's! Bale is noe on ¬£600k a week! Totally ridiculous! That doesn't come from his clubs earned income!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mark_rollason @tpjdavies I agree! It may annoy fans but ultimately, its very pragmatic planning by the club! If this pandemic goes on much longer, or if tv  eventually loses interest, clubs will go out of business! I'd back Albion to be one of those who survive!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies @mark_rollason We're saving ¬£280k per month if he goes! That's ¬£3m over the season of the wage bill! A tremendous saving, but there are still fans who think we'll use it in transfer budget! Its an economy move, not a funds raiser!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mark_rollason @tpjdavies Its all funded by tv money &amp; totally unsustainable! Baggies income this year is about ¬£140m - without tv, in a normal season, its about ¬£30m! Apart from those subsidised by rich owners, thats the same for most clubs! Hostages to fortune, driven by tv companies! Fragile structure!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mark_rollason @tpjdavies Football at the highest level is eating itself! So many diehard fans of many clubs are disillusioned with the clubs greed &amp; silly money still being thrown at players! Times have changed &amp; clubs need a collective rethink about priorities!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mark_rollason Have to say I agree with you! It would have been easy to make games not chosen for subscribers to have been put on the "red button" free like games where in the Champioship last season - without moving them! Clubs could have then offered a stream to STH or ppv as an alternative!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenBrownWF Frighteningly ignorant from "Deadwood!" He clearly has no clue about how WTO works! Or, apparently, the fact that ultimately it the consumer who "pays the tariff" in higher prices!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ethanhunt1961 @baggiestex 2/300 I'd guess - it only held 500 if it was rammed &amp; it was a Sunday night, so it wasn't that busy! They were amazing live, even in '69!

<|startoftext|>@Nick_wba_70 @baggiesanalytic Proper "away day" that was! Seem to remember we took thousands!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baggieant64 @DavidKe30081373 @SkySportsNews I saw that Chelsea were prepared to offer ¬£225m to sign Messi &amp; pay him ¬£1m a week! That's the owner throwing money in, since their annual income is only about ¬£350m! Obscene when currently so many are in position you are!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidKe30081373 @baggieant64 @SkySportsNews I really enjoy away days much more than home games now! Somewhere different &amp; a day out! Just as content going to Barnsley or Portsmouth as Old Trafford or Anfield - in fact, probably prefer it now! Be just as content watching a local team instead of pro football!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidKe30081373 @baggieant64 @SkySportsNews Yes I agree! I'm fast getting to the point where I'm "out!" I'd rather watch 22 guys in some minor league enjoying a game for the fun if it than players on half a million a week who earn more in a month than many do in 40 years at work!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baggieant64 @SkySportsNews Absolutely, greed is all it is! Football generally won't be better if this happens!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnandAmeet10 @TheDanMox @HLTCO And tell them if they come back, if it flops, they have to start again at the bottom of the pyramid!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liamjackjones Yep - I agree! üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liamjackjones Quite - wonderful opportunity to restructure football &amp; make progress, success and failure really a reality for all clubs again! PL has become about which owner puts the most money in to subsidise unsustainable wages &amp; transfer fees &amp; buy success! No point to that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liamjackjones Absolutely  - expel them! Arrogant American owners trying to maximise the return on their investment! Sod the fans who like to go away with their teams!  Man Utd fans might wear, since big international following, but I really don't see Liverpool fans accepting it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevend35022139 @SkySportsNews Are you really that thick? Obviously don't go to many live games?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkySportsNews It will ultimately kill football because if fans object to PPV, imagine the cost of an away day every couple of weeks to places like Madrid, Athens, Moscow etc! Or watch it on telly? Not the same as enjoying a current "away day" for real fans! Its just about greed - stuff it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brynbaggie Absolutely - and currently hardly a word of criticism of this lot... #BBC being, probably, the worst offender!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevenwbaprince Quite - a poor PM can be shielded by decent, competent people - but this lot aren't! Sadly too many voters are clueless when it comes to election time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thing is...we wouldn't have had this shit show of a government if all the folks in the Midlands &amp; North who usually vote Labour hadn't believed the Sun/Mail about what a disaster Corbyn &amp; Labour would be! Johnson's govt was never going to be a success! #BorisHasFailedTheNation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another government minister struggling appallingly on #BBCBreakfast! Are any of them competent or capable? Business Minister? Heaven help us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jastle68 I was pleased too overall! Thought we were so much stronger defensively. All the players who came in contributed well &amp; will still get better when match fit! A ray of hope in that performance!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@phoenixbaggie @le_lebouf76 I think there is something in that! He came off his line for crosses more &amp; was much more commending than he has been! A world class defender, all be it ageing, in front of him must give him more confidence!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie 3 centre backs at Brighton - Ajayi in with those two - leave out Krov! Need to pick the team to suit the opposition!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlbionTemplar "Its a marathon not a sprint" - I'm hopeful! ü§û<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daiseyrai ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wezzaboing74 I wouldn't be surprised to see 3 central defenders used in away games! Ajayi used too &amp; one of midfield 3 left out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daiseyrai None yet.....I'm working up to it! Just thought with a tad more luck we would have nicked that! Burnley came to "spoil" which they achieved very well! But they are a threat going forward &amp; we didn't do anything "silly" at the back! I'll open a bottle now! üòâüëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ I'm content! I thought the 3 debutantes all looked decent! More positives than negatives and if Grant wore smaller boots, his disallowed would have counted!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Start getting it right at the back, keep a clean sheet &amp; you don't lose! First step today! Confidence from good defending will eventually spread to better performances in other areas! The talent is there, just need more belief! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ONONERON Relax &amp; watching Baggies are not two things I do at the same time! ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A clean sheet is a start! Ivanoviƒá is still impressive! Thought confidence grew a bit after disallowed goal. #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie Won't say too much but its not the best link I've had!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well we now know Grant can head a ball! Unlucky! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too slow getting forward - Burnley are marking very tight &amp; getting behind ball quickly - we need to get behind them a bit! Not playing badly though! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WBA Have to say, I'm pleased &amp; impressed with that selection! Now its up to the guys to deliver on the pitch! #COYB #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anna66newton @MettlesomeTeri Abstinence - is that a pregnant pause....? ü§£üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getpromotionpr Yes - I don't think scoring will be hard for us with the obvious talent we have up front now! If Grant fits in quickly he could be a big bonus! From what I hear he is a bit of a natural finisher, which is what we need!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@splootman @LastBlairite @WBA @BBCMOTD @BBCMOTD2 @mrdanwalker @GaryLineker @BBCSport Yes - absolutely! Can't see any problem with that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LastBlairite @splootman @WBA @BBCMOTD @BBCMOTD2 @mrdanwalker @GaryLineker @BBCSport Yes 5.30 is an absolute sod of a time &amp; they've really chosen the "less attractive" games for that time! I'm presuming the later game tonight was the normal one chosen, in the first place, as the Monday night game? Slipped us in to last available slot!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getpromotionpr Yep agree! Next 3 games will define our season! 5pts or better - a win &amp; 2 draws - would be encouraging!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@splootman @LastBlairite @WBA @BBCMOTD @BBCMOTD2 @mrdanwalker @GaryLineker @BBCSport Well yes - but even if the games were available free or on red button its likely some would be moved to Monday! One game in each time slot seems to be "it" at the moment! Tv get less hits for advertising if it runs 2 games at same time, so that won't happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LastBlairite @splootman @WBA @BBCMOTD @BBCMOTD2 @mrdanwalker @GaryLineker Agree totally! @BBCSport should consider fans more at this time and either move #MOTD2 to Monday night whilst this current situation continues, or add a MOTD3 to cater for fans of clubs playing on Mondays!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StigsWBACousin Yep. But I'm becoming a very strong advocate of limiting clubs to operating within their actual income from tv, gate &amp; commercial income &amp; banning rich owners putting money in! Football has to be self funding, not in the gift of rich benefactors! Ultimately it isn't sustainable!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Baggies stay up this season it will be down to skill by management of the club, both through good recruitment &amp; on pitch! We work within our income! I'm happy with that! There is nothing to be cocky about when rich owners chuck mega-money into buying success! #JustSaying #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Great thread this - especially the comments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nick_wba_70 @Baggieboy1878 @Geordiebaggie Fair to say our fans motivated him more that day than they ever did while he was playing for us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Baggieboy1878 @Geordiebaggie @Nick_wba_70 Yes that's right - I think we were top of the league after about 8 games...then lost 13 in a row! I think the rot started when we lost 2-0 at Millwall &amp; we didn't get another point for over 3 months!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Baggieboy1878 @Geordiebaggie @Nick_wba_70 I think half way through it club gave him a new contract didn't they!? Beats a vote of confidence! üòèü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @SassenachAlba_1 My uncle did National Service in RAF &amp; had a great mate there from Glasgow who he kept in touch with. Every year his mate sent him a Broon's Annual for Christmas &amp; I loved reading them! The humour &amp; dialect used was wonderful &amp; even if it was "fun" its a heritage to cherish! üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @SassenachAlba_1 Excellent! üòÅüëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TripeUK Couldn't all 4 do it in rotation, a limb at a time.....?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AntSwailes @ALBIONFANTV That's the worry. We have 13/14 decent players, after that we struggle a bit for depth! You can carry one or two backup players in a starting 11 but its difficult to perform with too many in at once!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AntSwailes @ALBIONFANTV I'm content &amp; I'm not easily satisfied! If the defence tightens up, I think we have enough flair to create chances &amp; score a few goals! Need to win our "winnable" games, like the one on Monday, nick a few unlikely points &amp; stay free from any serious injuries to best players!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ONONERON @RussInCheshire Certainly Ron - no harm in debate &amp; disagreeing if it stays civil! Take care!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ONONERON @RussInCheshire I was in govt admin as a civil servant - that isn't politics - I worked for governments of all colours! I think for myself on what I know, not influenced by agendas of the Mail, Times or Farage clones! And don't link me to Starmer either, but disassociate me totally from Johnson!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ONONERON @RussInCheshire And, no Ted Heath was not a "mate"! I was in the first ever civil service strike against his government! I voted against joining EEC in the 1970's! Did you? I don't care for much about EU but, pragmatically, while it exists, we need to be in it! No deal is a disaster for us all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ONONERON @RussInCheshire Bitter? Just hope you don't need medication in a hurry after new year when its stuck in a traffic jam in Dover trying to get through customs!  Empty shelves in the Supermarket! Tell me what sovereignty you've lost being in EU? No legislation passed that UK government opposed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KashmirLoves People have no idea what's just around the corner! A rude awakening for many, sadly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ONONERON @RussInCheshire "No man is an island" Ron! "Strength in numbers" &amp; "the sum of the whole is greater than the component parts!" Pick your quote! I worked in government for 29 years, often on EU policy formulation &amp; international  trade and we're better in than out, believe me!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DareaderReader @HEREFORD10 Yes - torrential! Followed by Portsmouth - that was very wet too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DareaderReader @HEREFORD10 Yep - remember that - stand was demolished &amp; force 10 gale was blowing off the sea - ball kept doing 90 degree turns if it went in the air! Which it seemed to do for most of game!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DareaderReader @HEREFORD10 Coldest I remember was a Tuesday night in February at Sheffield Utd when we had Graham Fenton on loan! Upper tier behind the goal, about minus 15¬∞ &amp; only about 100 Baggies there! Took my 2 days to stop shivering!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DareaderReader @HEREFORD10 Always freezing at Oldham! Even in August!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HEREFORD10 @DareaderReader If that was PT, he was most approachable - a breath of fresh air to deal with when I was Chair of S4A - open &amp; honest - always kept us well in the loop about what was going on &amp; what his plans were!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus You might like this...üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybill82 Have no problem with that! If clubs can buy players cheap &amp; sell for a profit, good luck to them! We have several, on long term deals, who will earn us a big pay day if we go down! Good business model!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCardenMP Respect to you Dan! People before party - as it should be!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seen several tweets on here this morning from "comedians" saying Grant has failed his medical! Yawn! Do their mums know they're not at school? Grow up! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybill82 Latest is he's currently having a medical &amp; payment is actually being made over 3 payments - ¬£5m now &amp; 2 more of ¬£5m! Every piece of news changes details of deal - I suspect only the 2 clubs actually know what it is!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pongojohnson @diogoalwwfc And Dennison &amp; Robertson in the same deal! It was "buy one, get one free" then for Wolves they were so skint! We even put the 4 players in a Tesco bag for them! ü•≥üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybill82 Seems we're signing Grant on a 6 year contract &amp; paying ¬£15m over the whole contract length! I presume there is some front loading in the fee &amp; its not equal payments!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ @albion_gaming I haven't watched an England game for a couple of years now. Too much football on tv in general has taken away the novelty of live football, which I used to look forward to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeanDjh1976 @WBA @premierleague Absolutely right! When I was a kid there was still 4 division's but 3rd Div North &amp; South! Stopped the need for travelling from, for example, Exeter to Carlisle!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanNash86 @jaksoi67 @WBAinDE @BearwoodBloke Exactly the point I've been making! Back to what I said earlier about reforms starting with stopping unearned money being put in to finance clubs by rich owners! A new FFP set of rules should be the starting point!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaksoi67 @BearwoodBloke @DanNash86 That's fine &amp; basically what I'd love to see for teams in PL! Stops rich owners buying success &amp; creates an environment where good managers/coaches can achieve on merit! Also drives down wages &amp; transfer fees! Hate the silly spending in PL &amp; the "rich mans toy" some clubs are now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybill82 @JPercyTelegraph Aren't Fulham also after one of your defenders?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray @numbers_squad @JPercyTelegraph Happily! Ron who?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybill82 @JPercyTelegraph We'll see! I hope your owners use the income wisely &amp; build up the clubs success again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke @jaksoi67 @DanNash86 Then to achieve that you have to stop rich owners creating "elite" clubs with bigger expenditures by putting personal wealth in....like in the PL....otherwise the most monied clubs (the top 6) will always be the most successful &amp; the rest will be also rans!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybill82 @JPercyTelegraph Percy is usually reliable &amp; on the ball!üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WBAinDE @jaksoi67 @BearwoodBloke @DanNash86 Exactly - that's the point! And it also begs the question, what's the point of a competition that's a closed shop, dominated by 5/6 clubs with the biggest incomes?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray @numbers_squad @JPercyTelegraph "No first touch" was why Saunders said he sold him! He didn't really need one cos the ball was usually in the net with anything he managed to get on it! ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaksoi67 @BearwoodBloke @DanNash86 Does the experience of watching make up for the lack of real competition if your team isn't "at the top?" I find it hard to imagine football without promotion &amp; relegation &amp; lower clubs holding the dream, however unrealistic, that they might get to the PL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke @DanNash86 I agree its probably what the top clubs would like but from a fans perspective, what's the point? If your club wasn't going to challenge at the club its just a season of meaningless "friendlies" - no point watching - no adrenaline kick!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke @DanNash86 Thanks - I'll have a read. Easier to achieve without a pyramid obviously since clubs can plan for years ahead! However, the pyramid, with the attractions of promotion &amp; relegation &amp; a Bradford, Blackpool or Barnsley getting to the top is a major plus of English football!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke @DanNash86 Income through football is about ¬£800m a year! Outgoings exceed that!  If they were a manufacturing business &amp; bank called in the debt they'd be insolvent! Owners guarantees offer protection but it creates an uneven environment to operate in for everyone else!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke @DanNash86 The worrying thing for me is the major drivers in this are US owners &amp; the Americanisation of football is their aim! Personally, I don't want my football run on a US model. I find US sport artificial &amp; sterile! Just my view &amp; many will disagree - but these plans are about income!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke @DanNash86 Villa currently have wealthy owners - any success is down to that! Limit owners input &amp; their back on a level playing field!  Man U generate huge amounts of revenue because they're a world brand but their accounts show their current debt exceeds their assets! Unsustainable!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke @DanNash86 The one big change I'd make is limit clubs to operating on income (tv, gates &amp; commercial income only) &amp; stopping rich owners subsidising clubs running costs &amp; transfer budgets! Without rich owners, certainly Chelsea &amp; Man City wouldn't have had the success they have had!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeithT3103 @SkyNews Quite - without owners money they wouldn't even necessarily be "big!" Both Chelsea &amp; Man City, for example, were both very "ordinary" before they became hobbies for mega rich owners! Hobbies can soon be dropped when the interest wanes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Let them go &amp; expel them from the FA, which effectively stops them operating outside their own bubble &amp; excludes their players from international football! A breakaway requires massive support from other big clubs across Europe to be successful &amp; that's currently unlikely!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@poppacotty Let them go &amp; expel them from the FA, which effectively stops them operating outside their own bubble &amp; excludes their players from international football! A breakaway requires massive support from other big clubs across Europe to be successful &amp; that's currently unlikely!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ @albion_gaming I'm very close to calling it a day! Had enough of the greed &amp; taking fans for every penny! I've blocked emails from Baggies - fed up of them, almost daily, trying to sell me overpriced, tat "merchandise!" If these changes go through, professional football &amp; I will part company!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidKe30081373 @wbafc_alex @stevel_knievel Absolutely right! Ultimately they'll make a lot of money &amp; then lose interest, when returns start to diminish, as they will. Football, or whsts left of it, will be left high &amp; dry, to fend for itself &amp; pick up the pieces!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wezzaboing74 @albion_gaming Of course not! Fans don't provide a significant part of the income now! Owners need to be very careful though! No fans in grounds has shown what a sterile sport it is without them! Fans actually hold a lot of power if they unite &amp; use it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevel_knievel @wbafc_alex @GoldbergRadio @WBA Thanks - I'll check it out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wbafc_alex @stevel_knievel Quite! I'd start reform by limiting what clubs spend to their actual income &amp; stop rich owners pumping millions in to buy success! It would ultimately drive down transfer fees &amp; wages &amp; give smaller clubs a chance to actually compete! Self interest at top would never want that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lebigun @albion_gaming Absolutely!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@albion_gaming I agree! They use the threat of walking to try &amp; force it through! Other clubs should call their bluff! A Euro League might be attractive to clubs looking for more wealth but, I believe, fans would soon reject it! They'd ultimately see much less live football!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@albion_gaming I'd let them go! Their fans will soon revolt when "away days" are in Kiev, Moscow, Budapest etc! Ultimately thugs, like those suggesting this, get what they deserve!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevel_knievel @wbafc_alex Absolutely! The first question the clubs should be asking is why two American owned clubs feel the need to strengthen their already powerful position! This is a "big club" power grab, nothing else!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@moo66 Absolutely right. Much of this is self inflicted! I've been ultra cautious since March &amp; even when lockdown was eased I didn't change that!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@baggieant64 @WBANews_ We ask for too much for players we want rid of &amp; wonder why clubs hold out against us! If we'd managed to off load Austin &amp; Zohore we'd probably have Grant, or someone else, by now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baggieant64 @WBANews_ I agree - just imagine a statement from club on deadline day saying there'll be no more signings! So long to find a compromise over Grant - there must be some common ground with Huddersfield that both sides could have worked on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybill82 @WBANews_ Saga sums it up! Ridiculous isn't it! How can two clubs spend so much time playing hardball with each other? Find a compromise that's a "win/win" - can't be so hard, surely!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhallopAOTS @Geordiebaggie @WBANews_ ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie @WBANews_ Awful - I don't blame Dowling, I'm sure he's thinking "outside the box" to sort this mess out, but the owners  of the club are an absolute clueless disaster! To compete at this level, you have to "give it a go" &amp; we aren't!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamestaylor1 @CoinGifts Yes agree! His philosophy as a manager was to stop the opposition scoring! That's it! The Pulis of his day! But I saw him play &amp; he was "special" Think we got about ¬£40k for him when we sold to Arsenal in early 60's - that's mega millions in todays market!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamestaylor1 @CoinGifts But certainly one of the best right backs! Absolutely top class player!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the #PremierLeague want to sort out football finances &amp; create a more level playing field, limit clubs, so they run on actual earned income (tv, gate &amp; commercial income) &amp; stop rich owners giving them multi ¬£m handouts! Levels it out &amp; kills mega transfers &amp; silly wages!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WBANews_ Judging by the time Albion take to do a deal, he'll by 34 by the time its sorted! Really had enough of this shambles of a club!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pennwba Thing is, when it starts to look really bad, they change the banding on the official government map, so all the colours get lighter again &amp; it looks like its improving! Total con artists! Scratch &amp; sniff? Standard smell would be dog poo for this shower!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @neil_westwater Only just seen your question! Didn't know England were playing tonight! Currently disgusted with English football because of Premier League PPV deal &amp; conducting my own boycott!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShaneoTheBaggie @WBA Quite - most PL clubs weekly wage bill is 3 or 4 times that! The income from PPV is insignificant for them! I'm sure PL could have done a deal with Sky/BT to show games on peoples current subscriptions &amp; the extra advertising revenue would have brought more in!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShaneoTheBaggie @WBA Quite - PL &amp; clubs have become completely detached from reality. I don't want to hear them pleading poverty &amp; needing extra income when they are still collectively spending a ¬£1bn on new signings &amp; giving players contracts of ¬£100k per week! "Its ok, our mug supporters can pay!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neil_westwater Football won't survive the season - it'll be suspended again soon! Playing international games in the current situation was utter madness with the risk of players from many clubs coming together! And in answer to your question, no, I'm a bit to slow to play up front now! üòâü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShaneoTheBaggie My season ticket refund for last season is still in my club account with them - email to them tomorrow asking for a full refund now!  I'm disgusted with them! @WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ I feel the same....on both points!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getpromotionpr Yes - apparently they thought that because the EFL charges ¬£10 a game their "product" was worth more! Forgetting, of course, that few EFL games get live to air! Very poor marketing &amp; shocking customer relations!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"Even Wetherspoons may be drowning its sorrows this year"  https://t.co/9dfNSlvgZU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Will__Tinsley No, I agree! If 20000 paid for Burnley game (unlikely), the club get ¬£300k, that's all! Current wage bill is ¬£1m+ a week! The money they get is peanuts in the seasons budget &amp; the bad blood its causing between club &amp; fans really isn't worth it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Worth remembering that all the money from a PPV game goes to the home club - so any Baggies fans paying to watch the games at Brighton &amp; Fulham need to remember all the money goes to those clubs &amp; doesn't help Albion at all. #wba<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@geoff_rollason @SteveMadeley78 Me too - I'm sad I need to say it! They've let their fans down badly by supporting this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@geoff_rollason @SteveMadeley78 Well said! Appalled by this total greed - the PL clubs treat fans as mugs - enough is enough! I've mentioned on here before about players like Bale on ¬£600k a week! If players be paid sums like that, clubs can afford not to get extra income from games through PPV!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@magneticsparrow @jimmythewhack @WBA I'm appalled by it! It was an opportunity to offer fans "something back" for their loyalty at a time when many are feeling the hardship brought on them by covid! But they'd rather take a few more quid from people! Once too often in this case!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jimmythewhack If 20000 watch it, which they won't, the extra income is only ¬£300,000! Doesn't go far when our current wage bill is ¬£1m+ a week! But damage its done between club &amp; fans will take some rebuilding! No effect on transfers at all! Just massive #owngoal by #PremierLeague &amp; #wba @WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattstokes110 Me neither - its an absolute disgrace! Saw Morecombe FC, for instance, are struggling! Their annual income is ¬£2.5m to run a club &amp; pay all their players &amp; staff - that's what Bale gets a month! Nothing against Bale btw, just an example of how ridiculous the #PremierLeague is!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gareth Bale on ¬£600k a week takes 40000 fans paying ¬£15 a game just to pay for that! Time to rethink your priorities #PremierLeague - stop ripping fans off! So many currently suffering financial hardship &amp; you want to screw more out of them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ @AllAlbion I believe the game is moved because its only possible to cover a limited number of PPV at one time! However, Sky never had a problem last season putting any number of Championship games on the Red button at the same time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ @AllAlbion Exactly how I'm starting to feel! Been missing the away days, but got used to it now, so may not go as often! The abuse of the system this silly PL "compromise" offers doesn't bear thinking about!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ExpressandStar When the PL clubs take hundreds of pounds a season from each fan in season &amp; match ticket sales they should now show some respect &amp; support for fans &amp; press for all games to be live on tv until we can visit grounds again! #wba #PremierLeague #football #televisedgames<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@steve_smethwick Yes I agree! A fanatical secret billionaire from Smethwick...who owns a brewery...would be great! üòâüëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pongojohnson @PsychosisSafari Tend to think we're a "sensible" club surviving like a proper business on our actual income! Throwing millions into a "hobby" like all clubs with rich owners is dangerous &amp; ultimately unsustainable! When they eventually lose interest the clubs they dump are in huge trouble!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steve_smethwick Wish I knew! I did hear a US consortium made him an offer to buy us 18 months ago, but he turned them down! Don't understand now why he wants to own us anymore - we seem to be a burden to him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steve_smethwick It was a marketing tool for his Chinese businesses! PL football was big on Chinese TV then &amp; Palm owning Baggies raised their profile at home! Chinese government, at time, was encouraging the investment in foreign sport! That changed, so we became a low priority for Lai!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulLovatt2 That's very true!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think the government needs to decide if they want to save lives or save the economy! Seems increasingly that they can't do both! #priorities #peoplefirst #COVID19 #CovidFailures #Capitalism #peoplebeforeprofit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1leemorris Absolutely - the way they all sing from the same song sheet without checking their facts is painful! Not worth the money they're paid!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@griffraces @JohnTheBagtist He also transferred funds from the club accounts to the holding company accounts &amp; called them "management fees!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnTheBagtist @griffraces ...whilst increasing his own holding without restrictions! Effectively that how he got control! Once he got 80% of shares he could do what he liked. The other 20% with small holdings were totally marginalised! Legal, clever but not very "moral!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnTheBagtist @griffraces Originally the club articles of association limited share holding to 30% by any one person! Thompson was frustrated by that cos he couldn't get strongrr control! However Peace circumvented it by setting up a holding company &amp; offering shares in it for "club" shareholders....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnTheBagtist @griffraces He borrowed that ¬£3m in the first place &amp; secured it against the club! No risk to him! Then he borrowed another ¬£4m off club to buy more shares to get him over 80% ownership &amp; sold that loan to Lai since it was in company accounts!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnTheBagtist Yep - appalling lack of support from owner for manager. The reported budget was insulting! Teams in Championship have spent more! Don't agree with the way some owners bankroll clubs to silly levels but there's a need for something better from Lai in terms of commitment!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ Yes that concerns me too! If I were him, I'd be seriously considering my future now! Walk away with reputation saved, in protest at lack of support from owners - or get sacked at Christmas when we're struggling at bottom &amp; be the scapegoat!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@B_H_Baggie @thebighouses @MarkSew56019064 Yes you are right - the change lies with fans losing interest &amp; boycotting football - sadly that probably won't happen either since those "glory hunter, hangers on" that success attracts wouldn't want to see it end!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B_H_Baggie @thebighouses @MarkSew56019064 Saw the other day about Morecombe FC - annual income ¬£2.5m pa - that's what Bale is on a month at Spurs! That is crazy &amp; Spurs won't be funding that from tv money &amp; what fans pay in annually! The sport should be self sustained, like any industry, not propped up by external money!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B_H_Baggie @thebighouses @MarkSew56019064 I've never had a problem with Baggies living/working within income - my issues are with the PL rules that allow clubs with rich owners to put ¬£m's in to buy success! All clubs should be limited to working within actual income.  What football has become is ultimately unsustainable<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sicoop01 Sadly, I agree! The continuity that Jenkins gave us, after Lai bought club, has gone &amp; I can't see Dowling hanging around long with the constraints he has to work under! Need someone at the helm that knows the English game, not currently who we have!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhitstableNews @juliewassmer @ChrisJamesStone @canterburycc @Kent_Life @Kent_cc @FavershamLit @FavershamLife @CreeksideVinyl @thehotti Good to see! There was a BBCtv series made in #whitstable in mid 60's about a Thames barge owner operating from the harbour, called "King of The River", starring Bernard Lee but, sadly, no episodes have survived! This time, no doubt they will! üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sicoop01 Yes I agree - my big worry is that next season, if we're back in Championship, the better players in squad will be sold &amp; the money won't be reinvested! If I was a cynic (!) I'd feel Lai was getting his investment back by managed asset stripping &amp; then sell what's left cheap!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sicoop01 Exactly - bringing in players to improve the best starting 11 would have been the right policy, but we've only added squad numbers who were no better than what we already had! Still basically a Championship squad!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray Yep - we've got enough players just too many aren't what we need in PL!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@magneticsparrow Bit like watching paint dry.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Numbers in squad isn't the problem - its an upgrade in quality we need &amp; that doesn't seem likely to happen today! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hannanar However - he also realised if he wanted to sell, he had to have &amp; viable &amp; sound asset to offer, so he did enough to keep the club in PL &amp; actually ran it well! Once on offer came from Lai it was job done! Sadly Lai doesn't have a clue about football!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hannanar Sadly, through all that, no one with any understanding was clued up enough to question it! Basically Peace ripped the shareholders off - legally &amp; skillfully - but nevertheless he took them for mugs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hannanar Yep - JP borrowed money to buy Thompson's shares, borrowed money off the club to increase his share holding to get control, moved control of club to a holding company, which he effectively owned &amp; sold at an enormous profit! But we were still stable in PL though it all! Not now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hannanar My concern is, we're now owned &amp; run by people who have no empathy for the club &amp; no understanding of its history or traditions in the local community! Always in the past, even with JP, it was a "local" club! Now we're an asset figure on a set of accounts in China! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlbionFanatics Yep! Watching on tv lacks "emotion" that I get actually being there - so its a bit sterile!

<|startoftext|>@griffraces @Geordiebaggie I don't think anyone new to our squad this season has made an appearance in PL yet have they? The starting 11 from last season needed improving this season! So far, it hasn't been!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray Absolutely! Once we're behind we seem beaten! So little to offer today against an ordinary opponent was depressing to see!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@m28246491 Yep - we've got some talent in the side but they never see the ball because we're under pressure so much defensively!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPridsta @JohnTheBagtist Quite - Championship back 4 today &amp; little chance of anyone new incoming!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnTheBagtist Quite - but a striker won't start to address the shortcomings in this squad!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baggiestex Yep - but we don't!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GazPodmorePT Yep - exactly! Imho he'll call it a day in a few weeks &amp; walk!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mr_I_Flow Quite - immense talent with potential but needs time out of this - we need experienced starters! Could damage him long term in struggling side every week!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie @rjdowning @DavidKe30081373 I agree - we had options today to try something different! Krov starting, who he was "desperate" to get back, Gallagher, where was he? But starts Edwards, not PL quality &amp; has Harper on bench? Appalling decisions it seems! Nothing up top, no outlet! A mess!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rjdowning @Geordiebaggie @DavidKe30081373 High risk strategy, but I don't think he'll stay much longer - he'll walk with so little backing from owners!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@magneticsparrow I'd guess he'll resign soon &amp; I wouldn't blame him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie @rjdowning @DavidKe30081373 Edwards would be off to Rochdale, or somewhere similar, if I had my way! No way should he be starting a PL game!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brynbaggie Worst performance so far against an  average side! We offered nothing, anywhere!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rjdowning @DavidKe30081373 Quite - Chelsea, Man City &amp; others were struggling &amp; long term jokes until billionaires pumped in millions! Its pointless trying to compete on income like we do! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidKe30081373 @rjdowning I agree - totally! I'm not far off giving up on professional football altogether after over 50 years! Pointless watching it!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StephenBrownWF Absolutely - selection very odd today! Need more in Central midfield! Not breaking anything up &amp; pressure on back 4!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Krov on for Edwards? 1-0 is recoverable if we get more positive! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie Back 4 is collectively woeful - bad organisation not necessarily bad players!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Try not to be too "negative" but we offered absolutely nothing there at all! Saints aren't a strong PL side, but they could be 3/4 up!

<|startoftext|>@AshBurty Quite &amp; since tv cameras are at all games already its no big deal to show them all live to air.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshBurty Thanks - I hope so! They have all 10 games scheduled in for this weekend over 3 days, so its possible to achieve to give maximum coverage! Even games on red button would be better than the "iffy" streaming service thats on offer!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just seen tv games until November. We aren't on again this month after this weekend! Thought I'd seen that all PL games were going live on Sky or BT until crowds were allowed again! Seems not! Very short sighted by decision makers - need to keep fans engaged &amp; interested! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus ü§£üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scan1968 @WBA Lovely touch, I hope they didn't also ask you if you want to sign as a striker? ü•≥üòÅ Hope your recovery is going well, btw?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveMadeley78 I'd rather the club ran on income than millions pumped in by owners like many clubs now! Ultimately football is unsustainable &amp; current economic situation will hasten its demise! Many clubs survival will be hampered considerably when benevolent owners pull out as they will! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LastBlairite @MattWBA1983 @RobPaddockWBA Absolutely - also we wore green &amp; yellow when we were promoted at Oldham a few years before the 3 Degrees! We've used it for 45 years now! The ignorance displayed by some who profess to be football fans is appalling!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lott777 @WBA Chances are you'll start up front this weekend then! üòâüëç<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@histevegray @andyforklift @boing_baggies There were some real hard men in football then - people like "Chopper" Harris &amp; Norman Hunter, never saw him in that light! Much more than just a "stopper" - could play a bit too! Strength was he "read" the game so well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaggiesRoger @SaintsProgs @MemorabiliaMal @NewportCounty @TangerineTopic @ArchiveSaints @collectfootball We'd been to Colchester! We only had about 3000 tickets for that &amp; we were given a voucher that got us a ticket for every game after that, including the final! The "Colchester Voucher" became a Baggies legend around then!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaggiesRoger @SaintsProgs @MemorabiliaMal @NewportCounty @TangerineTopic @ArchiveSaints @collectfootball Did he? I remember he went off! Only game of that cup run my dad &amp; I didn't go to! BBCtv showed the highlights at 10.30 &amp; we didn't know the final score, just knew we had gone to extra time! Lovely surprise seeing us win!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@69baggies I've signed &amp; retweeted. üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray @andyforklift @boing_baggies The number of times he went through a game &amp; never got his shorts dirty....! A footballing defender - never a "hard man!" Would probably have had a pile of Scottish caps if the Scottish football powers hadn't had a "thing" against English based Scots at the time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaggiesRoger @SaintsProgs @MemorabiliaMal @NewportCounty @TangerineTopic @ArchiveSaints @collectfootball If I remember right, we won the replay 3-2 after extra time. John Osborne went off injured &amp; Graham Williams went in goal! We finished with 10 men! The days of one sub &amp; no goalkeeper on the bench!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray @andyforklift @boing_baggies He actually held the Albion record for consecutive games played until Tony Godden beat it! 160+ games, never sent off or collected enough yellow cards to be suspended &amp; never injured! That's quality &amp; remarkable for a defender in any era!Never a dirty player!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CeltYorkshire @NickCohen4 Somewhat tongue in cheek, I'd say its sad that others like Richard Branson &amp; Tim Martin, with huge wealth, don't share your positive attitude towards those they employ. Basically I think we agree in principle - just not on the finer detail in application.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CeltYorkshire @NickCohen4 I accept that &amp; you should be free to make that choice. My problem really comes with "means tested" catch all at a limit of ¬£16k savings, which is hardly wealth! Someone earning, say, ¬£50k a year made redundant is soon going to be back making another application!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CeltYorkshire @NickCohen4 National Insurance is supposed to be just that! Insurance to provide support in a time of need! If your car was stollen would you accept you don't need to claim on Motor Insurance because you have enough in bank/investments to cover the loss?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sicoop01 @LaurenWBA28 I heard he was on a goal bonus too, of ¬£10k a goal on top of his weekly ¬£50k - I have no problem with that, or his contribution/attitude last season, but probably time for him to move on &amp; people should be able to say that if that's what they think!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Great thread!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Only just over half wanted it &amp; they mostly had another "agenda!" In my opinion they were either right wing racists or thick! Possibly both! Horrible outcome &amp; the worst is yet to come! Be a "happy" new year!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies @glennthompson85 Yep - get them moved on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glennthompson85 Think they are all probably big earners &amp; that will have included inevitable promotion rises too! So what we save in wages is probably more relevant that any transfer fees we might get! Good business to get rid &amp; use the revenue saved elsewhere! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Matt1McArdle @SteveMadeley78 Quite....and we've brought two defenders in who haven't started in a PL game yet! Priority is still a striker imo! Austin will go soon it seems &amp; Zohore isn't in Slav's thinking! Need more choices there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ A small sacrifice for the pleasure given by that result, surely? Just looking for Fulham to oblige tomorrow night too against Villa &amp; it will have been a productive weekend! üòâüëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@poppacotty They definitely need a right back! Someone like Doherty at Spurs.......! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liamjackjones They've got a get out! They thought they were buying a footballer....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wolves are a mess at the back - really getting done for pace so often! I'm surprised. Early days still, but can't say I'm as bothered about playing them as I was a couple of weeks ago! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daiseyrai Sadly true - but so typically Albion ain't it! "A game of two halves, Saint!" As Greavsie used to say!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ Tighten up defending &amp; there is enough flair in the side to win games - some of our football tonight was excellent - a couple more signings &amp; I think we'll be fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daiseyrai Agree - great confidence booster for us, butwas partly down to Chelsea's apparent "entitlement" &amp; arrogance that they were 3 down in the first place! Poor management by Lampard in the first place (imho) not having them properly "up" it! We completely mugged them first half!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reynox78 Yes its a point gained - not 2 lost based on what most expected before ko!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnTheBagtist Agree - don't like criticising keepers but I thought he should have done better with 2 of their goals!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reynox78 Don't disagree they played well individually but they're a bit static &amp; disorganised as a unit sometimes when teams play through them! Second goal, gave them far too much space! But I'm content overall!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disappointed not to win in the end but we'd probably all have taken a draw 2 hours ago! We've shown we can compete going forward but really do need to sort the defence out! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tense!! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you think we'll declare at half time &amp; put them in to bat second half? #WBACHE #WBA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie That looks great! Fishing? Enjoy your day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Long wait today until 5.30.....hope we get a surprise &amp; it doesn't end in almost inevitable disappointment! To "pull one out" today, when we're universally written off, would be so typically Albion! üòâü§£ #everhopeful #WBA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jimmythewhack Absolutely right! A striker or another midfield player won't cure appalling defending like we saw today! We actually looked decent going forward but every high ball into box looked a likely goal for Everton!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke Huge risk signing him - great player in his day and hope he does a job for us, but....Lugano had a massive pedigree too but his legs had gone when he joined us! Lots of positives going forward today but someone solid at the back is a desperate need!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ajayi &amp; O'Shea are still learning their trade &amp; have great potential but playing in a defence that is currently so shambolic &amp; poorly organised will destroy their confidence! Slav needs a major think about how he uses them in next few games! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fallen apart again - but oh for a keeper that comes off his line! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4 goals against from woeful defending! That's 7 in 2 games! There's more in this game yet!  #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This defence is a collective liability! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We don't score disputed tap in's do we! ü§£ #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For 40mins we looked like the Baggies of first half of last season &amp; for last 5 we looked like lost souls!Take the positives from that but disappointing not to be level with 11 still on pitch! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Game over! Gibbs you're a total prat! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thats poor defending by everyone involved! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now comes the test! We've been the better side but need to stay positive  &amp; believe now its level! At least we've shown so far today we can compete at this level! #wba<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DickLaurent96 Yes - 2010 best win - but most memorable game was 1966 when we lost 5-4! Albion were "free scoring" then but couldn't defend - I think that season we scored about 120 goals in all competitions &amp; had over 90 against!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Albion2All About this time (Sept 1966) we were 4-1 down at half time but were superb second half to get back to 4-4! Everton scored &amp; injury time winner, 5-4! But a memorable game!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JamesHamiltonGK @Baggieboy1878 Have to say, I agree! Having a half decent game against a Div 2 team doesn't mean he's ready for PL yet! The gap is massive!

<|startoftext|>@scan1968 Good luck for a speedy recovery! Glad it's under control now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some decent performances tonight - useful against hard working opposition. Bit scrappy, but just recalling some of our awful performances in cup ties against lower league opponents over the years, so banana skin avoided! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The inability to keep the ball is worrying! Virtually every pass more that a few yards is given away! Harrogate are pressing well &amp; deserve credit, but we should be showing some quality in the basics! We're not! #WBA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@1rockstar123 @chrislepkowski @Unity_MoT Quite! But I suspect Evans probably only signed in the first place with a generous release clause in his favour!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshuaj_4589 In a word - no!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislepkowski @Unity_MoT @1rockstar123 Quite - people look at the actual quoted value of a signing &amp; think that's it, but "facts" are a lot more complex. I believe our wage costs the year we were relegated were about ¬£90m pa! Huge, impressive, job by club to recover from that &amp; get promoted again within 2 years!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Unity_MoT @1rockstar123 Yes, but your point is still valid! We can't rely on going down, getting the money &amp; coming up again! Eventually we won't, then we'll be "back in the pack" on an annual income of about ¬£20m &amp; struggling for years again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Unity_MoT @1rockstar123 Is that right about parachute payments? Thanks, I didn't know that! Makes staying up this season even more important then! There will come a time when we won't get back in a couple of years after relegation, then we could be in serious financial trouble!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Unity_MoT @1rockstar123 The problem is that loans &amp; structured deals impinge on future years budgets too! Basically, we've spent ¬£20m this summer making two loan deals from last season permanent. Any loan to buy will have that future effect!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@iainjwatson @kitmalthouse @BBCBreakfast So I presume a valid defence, if I'm charged with speeding doing 40mph in a 30mph limit, is to claim I was "upholding the spirit of the law" by not doing 50mph? Of course not, because a breach of law, is a breach of law - it isn't qualified by just breaking it "a little bit!"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gavin_poulton Well.....I did say I had a "feeling we might surprise people" but....what I really meant was that we would be so poor second half &amp; people would be surprised....! üòâ Honest guv!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoWhitstable @QuaysideW I thought that in May....ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoWhitstable @QuaysideW *withdrawl*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoWhitstable @QuaysideW Yes - still hoping for a trip home soon! Withdraws symptoms painful now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveBSmith Nothing creative in that side at all today! GD &amp; MP hardly saw the ball, we had no one to get it to them in midfield! A goal scorer won't solve the problem if no one creates anything! The club ownership need a real quick hard think about what they hope to achieve this season!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoWhitstable @QuaysideW ...and real chips! None of your catering frozen ones!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ @brynbaggie Quite - I think he had to try something different, but he doesn't have a lot of options with the current squad!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ @brynbaggie Correct - the gap between the PL &amp; Championship is immense, even if  players have what it takes to make the step up. Only time will tell if some of our squad have that! The second half fade-out today was very concerning though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joekapalo Quite &amp; neither Button or Kipre are likely to be anything more than squad fillers! A former club chairman once said to me, he wouldn't ever bring a new player to club if they weren't to replace someone we already had! Keep improving then! We've gone backwards, squad wise!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adam_Townsend Yes I agree - need experience at this level. Hope we get to see Kipre on Wednesday in cup! He's pacy apparently - not sure why he wasn't on bench today?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie I certainly didn't like the starting line up formation! Showed how thin the squad is &amp; options on the bench underlined it! Central midfield we have Sawyers &amp; Livermore &amp; realistically, no cover! Where was Kipre?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brynbaggie Quite - we need a player sitting in front of defence, like Yacob or Mulumbu! Break up play &amp; lay it of to someone creative!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie Harper "isn't ready" at this level! Needs a season playing every week in Div1/Championship to see if he's got it....which I doubt! Tactically, second half, Leicester got it right! Closed down our wing backs, cut off supply forward &amp; pressed higher! Slav did nothing to counter it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bartlebee24_ Agree - but the defence against Newcastle all on pitch today! Point was, they don't have pace to play against fast, quality forwards!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3 individual defensive errors! Game over! Can't make mistakes like that in PL! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bartlebee24_ I thought when we played Newcastle in Cup last season they really exposed how ill equipped we were at the back to deal with PL pace - we didn't address it &amp; its done us today! The inadequacy in midfield has also been highlighted!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@m28246491 Pong pong! If this is anything to go by!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bartlebee24_ This is certainly a reality check! The owner needs to take note....but he won't! 3rd goal was also a very naive challenge by O'Shea that he didn't need to make! Basically we've gifted Leicester 3 goals but amateurish defending!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We've been very poor this half! Need a dominant, creative central midfielder &amp; someone up front who can hold ball up a bit &amp; bring Grady &amp; MP into game more! Loads to do still! A defeat is a blessing maybe? A win might have suggested a false dawn! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bartley totally done for pace there! However well he does for much of game, always prone to at least one cock up! Fatal at this level #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WBAinDE Agree totally<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WBAinDE I thought he did his job OK - big step up for some of these players &amp; they're doing fine so far! I don't see the need for anyone to moan after that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bit scrappy but I'll take that, we look comfortable enough but seriously lack a cutting edge! Robinson working hard but really isn't suited to lone striker role! However, content so far! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mark_rollason Oh ye of little faith<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ Hope so Christine - all the negativity must have motivated the players to prove people wrong! Also, the two other promotees lost yesterday - 3 out of 3 losing on opening weekend would be unusual! Onwards &amp; upwards!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StephenNeale17 @huntywbafc Yes - I think they brought in new rules to set limit at two overall at start of this season didn't they? Its maximum of 2 at any one time &amp; 4 in total over a season if any loans aren't season long.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bartlebee24_ @histevegray @AshBurty Nobody has been more negative than me over the years, but I don't feel it this season - gut feel is we'll be ok - just!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray @AshBurty @bartlebee24_ I agree! A long way to go - I'm not too worried yet - let's enjoy the ride!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshBurty @bartlebee24_ The younger players are all still improving &amp; could well make the step up, surprise a few people! Get a finisher into squad &amp; the creativity is likely to be there! Tighten up defence too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@griffraces Exactly - seems the players have a hunger &amp; belief - the fans need it too! "Onward into the valley of death.....canon's to the left of them, canon's to the right!" Trouble is...they all got blown to pieces! ü§£ü§£üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshBurty @bartlebee24_ I'm not convinced were going to be as bad as some others! Far to early to judge! I think Slav &amp; Dowling know more needs to be done! We'll see but I'm not writing us off yet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeefyBaggie1965 Apparently! Rumours but seems to have some truth! Time will tell!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sick of seeing Aynok &amp; Ayli whinging on here about what a bad season we're going to have! Jeeeesusss guys,we haven't completed our squad or kicked a ball yet! Give it a rest!

<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie Allegedly - I'll believe when I seeing but seems there is still mileage in this yet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bartlebee24_ @AshBurty And still 3 weeks to the close of the window! "It ain't over till....." - you've been Baggies long enough not to judge them too soon! I doubt we'll set the world on fire but writing us off before we've kicked a ball lacks respect &amp; is a bit unfair! Onwards &amp; upwards!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeRGreenwood89 Lockdown now - end the season! I knew we'd finish above Wolves! üòâüëçü•≥ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybill82 Yes - young player, still developing, resale value for years yet if we bomb completely this season &amp; ¬£'s in the bank for you to help build a squad!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently my tweet was way off the mark - rumours he's currently at Hawthorns having a medical!! Watch this space!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybill82 Any chance of a deal seems to be receding - we won't meet asking price &amp; neither club seem to want to compromise! Apparently we're looking at other options now! I think he'd have been great for us! Good luck today - good test for you against just relegated side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie @Baggiebhoy1986 Its all speculation at the moment though isn't it? We will get a better idea of how competitive we are in a few weeks. I don't expect us to set the world alight but I don't see us nailed on to get relegated! We'll soon know!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@huntywbafc @StigsWBACousin @Baggiebhoy1986 Exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Surreybaggie Yes I agree - anything we achieve, if we finish outside bottom will, will have us called "the surprise package!" Much better situation to be in than having pundits adding pressure!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Baggiebhoy1986 I know we'll probably find it hard, Nick - but I think by the close of window, we'll have a squad &amp; manager capable of doing enough! I don't share the negativity that so many are displaying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Baggiebhoy1986 They said that about Sheffield Utd last season! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesHamiltonGK @StigsWBACousin @JosephMasi_Star @JPercyTelegraph Exactly! Can't go wrong for a year!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StigsWBACousin @JamesHamiltonGK @JosephMasi_Star @JPercyTelegraph Quite - I'm presuming if Baggies are interested then his legs haven't gone! Great business for a season if it comes off! If not, its a short term cock up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesHamiltonGK @JosephMasi_Star @JPercyTelegraph It'll either be another McAuley.....or another Lugano....! Time will tell, if he signs! #wba<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AntWBA434 @saidthe_boy Must be a ball living in a care home! ü§£ü•≥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OfBaggies Think the problem for Huddersfield will be if they &amp; Baggies don't reach a compromise - going to have one very unhappy player in their squad this season who doesn't want to be there! Never a good option!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie @SPridsta @Albionwestand 5 would be a bonus - I think we'll get 3, maybe 4.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaksoi67 @Albionwestand Yes - really never expected Grady to come back - that's a huge plus!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPridsta @Albionwestand Yes - possibly another defender too! But we aren't far off!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies @Albionwestand Yep - I agree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Albionwestand I reckon we're stronger because the signings we've made are all young &amp; still improving - they will grow in PL! Great business by Baggies if they all come off! Very content so far - a couple more by close of window &amp; we'll be competitive!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@albion_gaming Quite - if Brentford hadn't had an awesome run of back to back wins, us finishing in top two would never have been threatened! Eventually, when they caught up, Brentford couldn't handle the pressure!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshesVictory @albion_gaming Don't disagree Kevin, but my snipe is really at the "experts" singing our praises at Christmas &amp; writing us off now! Basically same squad! Lazy punditry!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@albion_gaming Quite &amp; so many "pundits" were saying at Christmas, when we'd only lost one game, the squad "looked good enough to do well in PL" because it was "full of quality!" Current views are only based on our indifferent last 9 games! Predictions pointless till window closes in October!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DoodWBA But just think...when he bangs in 20 goals by Christmas we can recall him......üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlakeCalum Exactly - the fact that no club that's had him on loan wants to sign him after loan spell is all you need to know!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeSomers @LawReeBabes Exactly - people were saying the squad up to New Year was good enough for PL - the negativity comes from last 9 games, which wasn't representative of whole season! We won't set world alight, but if we play to our potential we'll be ok with a couple more signings!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlakeCalum He runs fast....pity he never takes the ball with him! Awful for us &amp; the clubs he's been on loan at in last 3 years! We can't all be wrong!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lebigun @Jay89R @barryd19651 @tpjdavies @WBA_Thoughts Yes, still some time to do more deals - don't think the team that starts this weekend will be the finished artilcle by some way!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jay89R @barryd19651 @tpjdavies @WBA_Thoughts Agree - I think Slav &amp; Downing know what's needed - just worry a bit we won't get them! Striker would be priority for me, then another central midfielder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies @WBA_Thoughts @barryd19651 Exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@barryd19651 @tpjdavies @WBA_Thoughts I don't doubt it James - just pointing out we still need to do some business to strengthen what we have! May have to wait till end of window before we know our final squad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies @WBA_Thoughts @barryd19651 Squad is weaker than last season if we don't bring back Krov &amp; Robinson with Brunt &amp; Barry leaving too!

<|startoftext|>@WBA_Thoughts @barryd19651 Field was (apparently) being suggested as a make weight in any deal for Grant but Huddersfield weren't interested! Neither he nor Harper are ready for PL yet! Time will tell if they ever are! Squad is appallingly thin still! Lots to do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScruffBaggie Yes - quality stuff! We didn't get the wall to wall coverage then that we get now &amp; for any football fans in 50's/60's they were a "must!"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@brynbaggie @DeanoTheBaggie Yes, I think it was the only shot they had! They didn't cross the halfway line again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffreyMorris3 @DeanoTheBaggie Didn't Bomber score an "equaliser" from about 30yds that the ref disallowed because someone was "offside" near the touchline?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lazydave68 @DeanoTheBaggie I've got a feeling it was about -15¬∞C that night! Used to stand in paddock in front of Rainbow Stand then &amp; everybody was huddled together trying to keep warm! Never been so cold at a game since!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sbaggieboy60 @DeanoTheBaggie Yes - I remember it well! Absolutely freezing &amp; evening game - game probably shouldn't have been played!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeanoTheBaggie *ice rink!*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeanoTheBaggie Was that the season we played Dunfermline in later round on an "ice ring" of a Hawthorns - they scored early &amp; kept hoofing ball into Halford Lane for rest of game? Happy days!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshBurty Useful backup - I'd keep him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColmBrosnan Agree - useful squad member with loads of experience<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rjdowning I'd give him another contract. Useful backup<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ Me too! I feel Grady signing could be compared to Cunningham! Young player, bags of talent, only going to get better! Also hearing glowing reports about Kipre from people who watched him a lot last season! Encouraging!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sbaggieboy60 Quite! Very strange appointment!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another ace appointment by our wonderful government! Tony Abbott to promote our trade!  https://t.co/X0vVZHk3RD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie Remarkable! They were dead &amp; buried when you tweeted!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie I stand by my original comment!  üëçüòÅ Remarkable comeback by England!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been a good Friday....all things considered.....üòÅ #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybill82 @htafc Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie Yes - looks like the club actually have a strategy! Good planning &amp; forward thinking!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybill82 Think the fee is down to Wigan administrators trying to get some money in urgently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie Quite - spot young talent, get them cheap, on a long term deal, with a resale value &amp; its a bonus if it comes off &amp; we probably get our money back if it doesn't. So much better than paying over the odds for older players past their best!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybill82 Yes - suggestions here that there has been a "breakthrough" on the fee &amp; a deal is "imminent!" We'll see. We've signed Kipre from Wigan this morning for absolute peanuts - ¬£750k - its a punt, but it can't really be much of a risk for that money! Looked decent last season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think Kipre is a good piece of business by Baggies in current climate - clubs spend millions on potential &amp; we've spent peanuts for just that for a player who is still young &amp; improving! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jacob_Rees_Mogg Still in the 4th form? What japes, chaps!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Mark_83 @mg_ashmore No Chinese money has come into #wba &amp; I believe the Chinese owners of #wwfc had money in separate businesses in gulf bank accounts so weren't impacted by Chinese government restrictions! Understand the point you make but think its overstated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getpromotionpr @Gururumours Too old. Had no pace when he was with us, even slower now! Pace is so important in PL. Barry showed in his last game for us, v Newcastle in the cup, how off the pace he'd become against PL opposition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@80_mcswan #Covid_19 will be used as an excuse/reason for a great deal more too in the coming months!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gururumours Think he played about a dozen games. Then went off on loan for 3 years! Talented player no doubt, but never cut it with Baggies!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gururumours Hero!!!! I don't think so! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies Yes - never any speculation or rumours about Odemwingie before he arrived - first we knew was when signing was announced! Hopefully they're chasing someone off the radar now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies Yes I agree. We need a decent striker to stand a real chance in coming season too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies Yes, but its worth remembering the consensus from so many fans at Christmas, when we'd only lost one game, was that the squad would be comfortable in PL. Do we judge squad on that, or last 9 games? Same players.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie Yes - means a lot when team mates get on. Also a bit of continuity will be good since there will be some new additions to the squad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cricket_outlaw Yes I agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybill82 Field is still young &amp; has loads of potential - he'd be a good option for you. Don't judge him on Charlton stint, had a season ending injury round Christmas &amp; came back to us. Charlton fans seemed to like him when he played though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tend to think if we do get Grady &amp; Krov back, with MP, they'll continue to improve in PL. None of them are the finished article yet &amp; should develop well at higher level - all got what it takes to get better! Good business by #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonJonesSnr Don't think anyone with a brain will be surprised! Johnson was never appointed for his intellect or ability, but to charm the gullible masses, win an election &amp; deliver Brexit! Job done - now he's expendable - be gone soon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kentishtrivia Apparently, years ago, #Whitstable people used to call anyone from Faversham or Herne Bay "furriners" &amp; throw stones at them if they visited the town! A bitten finger seems about par! Now its just DFL's  üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybill82 Yes, can't see us paying ¬£16m up front. Think most deals now are phased and/or performance based aren't they.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybill82 Seems its now making the news here now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybill82 Have they? That's not made the news here yet. One or two half hearted comments that we "might" be interested but more rumours about Deeney on loan. Hope you're right, I'd prefer Grant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevel_knievel Its in inverted commas because its tongue in cheek &amp; wasn't really meant to be a serious comment! It was really a snipe at the whingers! Obviously sarcasm from me needs to be more obvious!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HEREFORD10 Don't mind how the club conduct their business Simon, its the end result that matters - just get fed up with the constant speculation &amp; rumours from people who clearly know nothing! Think in recent years some of our best deals have arrived off the radar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@griffraces @Unity_MoT Exactly! Players won't hang around waiting for Baggies to decide if they really want them or not!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshBurty @TheVan @SamReeve28 Its all compound by the fact window doesn't shut till October! We can't change that &amp; if players/clubs are hanging on to see what other offers they have, not a lot we can do about it! Transfer deal are so complicated now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVan Not judging the deal really, Steve, just the apparent faffing, speculation &amp; miss information that is rife at this time of year!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVan @AshBurty While you are...see if you can get me a good deal on a crate of 18yo Glenmorangie! üëçü•≥ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVan I would have thought club would have a "wish list" &amp; work down it in some sort of order, moving on to next when top options aren't possible! Seems we've been linked with "back up" option for weeks &amp; are now considering "better" options! Sends a great message to Kipre!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems all the "ITK" accounts that have had Kipre signing for us "within 48hrs" are off beam as usual - Baggies clearly still in "faff" mode - considering, weighing up, contemplating, thinking about a bid..eventually, possibly, maybe..! Don't you just love this time of year! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juliewassmer @sarah_j_young When I'm there I find the week days very much the same as they always were - just summer weekends have become very "distasteful" in many ways! However trendy Whitstable is at present, fashions come &amp; go &amp; I doubt it will always be "the place to visit!" Stick with it Julie!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missyouemmy @juliewassmer @sarah_j_young Sold my grandmothers old house in Cromwell Road in 1984 for ¬£20k! It sold again 2 years ago for ¬£480k! Where I live now a similar house would be ¬£250k!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missyouemmy @juliewassmer @sarah_j_young Agree - thought about moving back in last few years but relocation from Worcestershire to Whitstable is impossible without a huge new mortgage due to difference in house prices! Also I believe there are over 300 "holiday homes" to rent there now on AirB&amp;B - very sad indeed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adriansewell53 Quite - can't understand how people are predicting our season when they don't even know what the squad will be yet! I'm expecting half a dozen new faces by close of window! #mrpositive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adriansewell53 Don't joke Adrian....the doom &amp; gloom on here before season starts from a section of Baggies fans is already depressing enough! üòÑ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juliewassmer @sarah_j_young Thanks for copying that to me. A depressing read but an article that needed writing. When I grew up in Whitstable it was a small, run down seaside town with little tourism. I'm pleased how its developed over last 30 years or so, but the consequences now are hardly worth it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@m28246491 Go on....rub it in...üòú! Seriously, I hope you have a lovely day - say "hello" from me too! üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juliewassmer @canterburycc @kentpolicecbury Yes, depressing isn't it that people have such little respect for themselves, never mind the environment in which they live! I have been sad to see this unfold this summer! Seems to have been worse than in previous years!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@psclarke86 I'm Samsung &amp; it worked fine last year - so still using same software &amp; its same system etc, but I can't get anything to actually sync into phone calendar.<|endoftext|>

I click on download &amp; get message saying "all done ok" but nothing appears on callender? What am I doing wrong?

<|startoftext|>As August draws to a close, sad to say this is the first June/August I haven't at least spent some time in #whitstable during those months since I was born there! Sad times for me. The town is such an exceptionally special place in summer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WBADyl Nobody ever used to care about pre-season friendly games. They still mean nothing &amp; players all get an outing or two to "up" fitness levels, but some of the paranoia on here today trying to "read" something into it is really pathetic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_the_a_bis @BearwoodBloke Happy birthday btw! Balloons rising up your tweets! ü•≥üëçüòÑ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daiseyrai Our collie had a gut blockage several years ago &amp; she very nearly died - at vets a week &amp; very touch &amp; go, but she came through it. Very worrying time. Glad Leo is on the mend....watch out he doesn't play the sympathy card though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_the_a_bis @BearwoodBloke Yep - that's why I remembered seeing it around Christmas about the fee still owing. Forgot we'd sold it off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sbaggieboy60 Yea but...no but....! Well its one or the other! Hey ho...who'd run a football club?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke @_the_a_bis What? Taking out a loan....or buying Dawson? üòâüòÑ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_the_a_bis @BearwoodBloke Yes I think you may be right. There was definitely some deal they did to get cash in early.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sbaggieboy60 Thought it was over two seasons? Don't recall where I actually saw it now, but remember seeing it mentioned somewhere during January window.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke Did they? I heard it was part paid last season &amp; the rest this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@barryd19651 I know - but there would be a hefty loan payment which could be waived against what they still owe for Dawson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@phoenixbaggie Nudge nudge wink wink....say no more! ü§£ü§£ü§£üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think Watford still owe us money for Dawson - flexibility there to actually bring Deeney in by just tweaking payments &amp; no money actually changing hands? #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daiseyrai Glad he's home! Worrying times when a dog is sick...they can't tell you how they're feeling.... but you kind of know!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Martw90 @Geordiebaggie @DoodWBA Yes, I agree about Edwards. Currently more likely to contribute than Leko. Really hope Leko does well at Blues, but don't see him as PL player at the moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JWba1996 @Carpenterdf Yes, domestic loans &amp; foreign loans count differently. European loans are not limited, as far as I am aware, something to do with freedom of movement &amp; no restrictions on where someone can work in EU. May change when we finally lose all EU membership rights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie @DoodWBA Saw him in preseason at Bristol Rovers when he was 16. Looked so full of potential. By the away cup tie at Brighton, season before last, I thought he'd not developed at all. Like so many "hot" youngsters, they don't step up. But he could do very well at Blues, I hope he does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie @DoodWBA Skillful with the ball but too often no final product &amp; a lack of the good "decision." Not yet a PL player - time will tell if he ever is. Right to move him on now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gavin_poulton A pound a Matalan? Buy one, get one free!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LastBlairite Goodness! Is that for real? Its an absolute mess! Looks like it was designed by a committee who couldn't agree!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulTho54463285 @BuzagloToBalis Pleased to see you getting the credit you deserve, Paul. As you know, I was privileged to be Chair of S4A throughout your Chairmanship of our club &amp; the courtesy &amp; inclusiveness you showed to shareholders &amp; all supporters was always appreciated by us all at the time. Happy days!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trevorbailey61 @VillaBoy68 Lol - how to win friends.....!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VillaBoy68 I remember this so well - it was the day Ken McNaught &amp; Tony Morley made their debuts for Baggies after their summer moves from Villa! A great atmosphere, a Derby, great day out (despite result!) - what football is all about, soon may it return!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshBurty @Jasemor @WBA Quite - I think we're still owed stage payments for Chadli, Dawson &amp; Rodriguez aren't we?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@barryd19651 @Geordiebaggie @Albionwestand Agree - not sure why Burnley feel they need another striker - if its not just a rumour - Grant can play wide too though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@barryd19651 @Geordiebaggie @Albionwestand Don't think Burnley were in the frame in January<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSock Almost as good as "We've got Tchoyi we've fun, we've got seasons in the sun!" üëç ü§£ü§£ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Albionwestand I understand from a Huddersfield fan that we were in for him in January &amp; he wanted to come, but their board blocked move then &amp; Grant "wasn't pleased" - think a deal is more on cards now they need to cut overheads but Burnley also sniffing around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Coloradocollin Think the rules in PL are fairly relaxed about foreign loans aren't they? Don't think there's any limit?  Domestic loans has a limit of course.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baggiedave70 @JamesHamiltonGK Absolutely ...which is why people saying our budget is too small need to understand that what we have (allegedly) available can produce an actual spend of 3/4 times more over the length of a players contract!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@andybill82 Good profit all the same! When did you sign him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkySportsNews @DoodWBA Getting arrested for a "punch up" is one thing &amp; he's not the first high profile sportsman to do it &amp; won't be the last....but convicted for attempted bribery is something else!

<|startoftext|>@andybill82 How much are they looking for? Not sure why Burnley are in for him, they are already well served up front.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke @WBA1878 @Prof_Chadwick @foreverabaggie @TheBaggiesBible Yep - makes PL survival imperative to protect an income stream! Can't expect to keep bouncing back every time we get relegated - eventually it won't happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peston @BorisJohnson Who's been running the country then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@foreverabaggie @WBA1878 @Prof_Chadwick @TheBaggiesBible Absolutely right! I think Jenkins will have left the club financially sound, so a quick disposal would mitigate risk  but I dread to think what state we might be in a year or two from now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeefyBaggie1965 @griffraces @Hero_Taylor9 @huntywbafc @WBA @LHatfield_Star @JosephMasi_Star Naughty üëçü•≥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WBA1878 @Prof_Chadwick @foreverabaggie @TheBaggiesBible We'll see - but I bet its a few million down &amp; the rest over the length of a 3/4 year contract. That's how most deals are done, never all fee up front. Think we're still owed outstanding payments for Dawson &amp; Rodriguez aren't we?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeefyBaggie1965 @griffraces @Hero_Taylor9 @huntywbafc @WBA @LHatfield_Star @JosephMasi_Star He'd probably come over on the Friday for a Saturday game....then have to quarantine for 2 weeks and miss it.....üëçü§ûüòÑüòÑ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WBA1878 @Prof_Chadwick @foreverabaggie @TheBaggiesBible Also saw it suggested at weekend that Wolves Chinese owners have told Nuno there is no money for transfers &amp; if he wants to buy, he's got to sell first! The Chinese bubble in English football has burst!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WBA1878 @Prof_Chadwick @foreverabaggie @TheBaggiesBible His motives are in your last sentence! That was it, pure &amp; simple, PL on Chinese TV was big &amp; owning a PL club fit his business portfolio well! Not so now! I reckon if he could get his money back, he'd sell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeefyBaggie1965 @huntywbafc @WBA @LHatfield_Star @JosephMasi_Star Whatever people thought of him, he was a great "finance" man &amp; kept club solvent &amp; maybe the plans Lai has didn't sit well with him! Seemed a very sudden exit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hero_Taylor9 @BeefyBaggie1965 @huntywbafc @WBA @LHatfield_Star @JosephMasi_Star My guess is he's "trimming" costs to improve the accounts, to put club on market while we're in PL &amp; club's a more desirable asset! Anglo/Chinese relations are deteriorating &amp; I don't think PL is shown in China any more! We're not a business he needs if no "benefits" for him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeefyBaggie1965 @huntywbafc @WBA @LHatfield_Star @JosephMasi_Star Also worth remembering that Jenkins took no salary for months while keeping staff on through lockdown, but as soon as he's gone &amp; we have a Chinese CEO, jobs are cut!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeefyBaggie1965 @huntywbafc @WBA @LHatfield_Star @JosephMasi_Star Time for our local media to earn their corn and start asking some searching question at the club perhaps? Straight question to club asking them to confirm or deny rumours of staff cuts &amp;, if so, why! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@huntywbafc @BeefyBaggie1965 @WBA @LHatfield_Star @JosephMasi_Star The debt was Peace's, who borrowed the money off the club to buy the last lot of shares so he could sell the club &amp; make a fortune &amp; not replay the loan but sell it on! Total Con man! Lai can't repay cos Chinese government controls won't let him transfer money out of China!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeefyBaggie1965 @huntywbafc @WBA @LHatfield_Star @JosephMasi_Star 20% capacity is the figure I think being mentioned but no date yet, though October mentioned, so at the Hawthorns that's about 5000. But if they're redundant &amp; they've been with the club any length of time, they'll be due statutory redundancy pay so it is costing club to get rid!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@huntywbafc @BeefyBaggie1965 @WBA @LHatfield_Star @JosephMasi_Star No attendances in foreseeable future, so no ticket sales, no match day sales of club items or hospitality, little demand for corporate activity - sad, but current fact of life in hospitality/sports  industries - no business can keep staff to sit on their hands - it'll get worse!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@juliewassmer @whitstable üòâüëçüòÅ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshesVictory @BigAjayi @monkeys_show Think there was a lot of recruitment going on then that wasn't necessarily down to managers! Remember reading when Lugano first turned up at training, Clarke said, "who is that?" (Think it was Clarke who was manager then?)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigAjayi @monkeys_show Exactly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigAjayi Exactly -  he was 18 with us &amp; nowhere near ready to play in PL....like most 18yo prospects!

<|startoftext|>@P4ulG87 Quite! Also most transfer payments are spread over a number of years - so a player signed for, notionally, ¬£15m may only take ¬£5m out of this seasons budget! I don't read this crap anymore, I wait to see the actual signing announced!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@samjbox @WBA I agree. Since the cut off date for "early bird" tickets hadn't been reached when sales were suspended, the only fair way for selling limited HST's would be to use the loyalty points system. Majority of fans would accept it as fair &amp; unbiased. #wba<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lukestokes84 I don't disagree with any of that but concerned it won't be enough! Depends how much they can do with loans. Don't see Grady or Robinson coming back, Krov maybe. Brunt &amp; Barrie gone &amp; maybe a few more fringe players yet! Leaves squad very thin.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lukestokes84 Trouble is we need 6/7 additions - requires some serious dealing by club! You don't get a PL striker for ¬£10m but Duffy for that is a good buy! Loan striker may get a better player?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RosanneJedly @7loulou2 @EUtopean I'm a similar age, born just after the war, but I am totally pro EU &amp; believe Brexit is a disaster.

<|startoftext|>@TheVan @Hero_Taylor9 @griffraces @Darkbluebaggie @TheRainbowStand @jimmythewhack No!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVan @Hero_Taylor9 @griffraces @Darkbluebaggie @TheRainbowStand @jimmythewhack Exactly  - different times! I went to my grans, who lived at Northwich &amp; said I thought I'd surprise her! She cooked me a lovely meal! #silverlining<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hero_Taylor9 @TheVan @griffraces @Darkbluebaggie @TheRainbowStand @jimmythewhack That was level I was thinking at too! As many turn up as want to go &amp; get there about 10 minutes before ko! A car load of away fans turn up - or come on the team coach!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVan @Hero_Taylor9 @griffraces @Darkbluebaggie @TheRainbowStand @jimmythewhack As an aside, I remember travelling to Liverpool for a Baggies game years ago - got there at 1.30 &amp; the ground was full, gates shut, didn't get in! Before the days of tickets for terraces &amp; away ends! Irrelevant to this debate, but it still annoys me! üòâü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVan @Hero_Taylor9 @griffraces @Darkbluebaggie @TheRainbowStand @jimmythewhack That is the problem isn't it - one size doesn't fit all! Needs some real thinking "outside the box" and that isn't going to happen on current form!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVan @Hero_Taylor9 @griffraces @Darkbluebaggie @TheRainbowStand @jimmythewhack Yes I agree with you but if hundreds can congregate on a beach unchecked, surely a couple of hundred can attend a local non-league football match where social distancing controls can be applied?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVan @Hero_Taylor9 @griffraces @Darkbluebaggie @TheRainbowStand @jimmythewhack Not strictly true Steve - my home town has about 4 miles of beach with numerous access points but hundreds congregate in a stretch about 200 yds long &amp; leave the rest empty! Why? Because a couple of pubs are close - so bad that police now impose a dispersal order if it gets busy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hero_Taylor9 @Darkbluebaggie @TheRainbowStand @jimmythewhack I played decent level grass roots football Paul (don't ask how many years ago now!) - but keeping going financially was always a struggle,  those running the club were amazing what they achieved &amp; its got even harder in recent years. I so hope common sense prevails soon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hero_Taylor9 @Darkbluebaggie @TheRainbowStand @jimmythewhack I would have thought something must be possible for clubs who get gates of a few hundred, mainly standing! The income from paying fans is their lifeblood - grass roots football is just as important as PL in the overall structure of football!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hero_Taylor9 @Darkbluebaggie @TheRainbowStand @jimmythewhack Its non-league clubs I feel sorry for too! So many give their time to keep them going &amp; no gate income will be the death of many. Very sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darkbluebaggie @TheRainbowStand @jimmythewhack All or nothing for me too! Some crowds at cricket have been tried just using one seat in 3 &amp; alternate rows but that would never work at football &amp;, as you say, can you imagine the fan meltdown for those not selected for a seat!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRainbowStand @jimmythewhack Doubt there will be fans at any games at all next season. Think it will be this time next year before fans return...unless a vaccine is developed before then! Don't see reduced crowds being possible &amp; avoiding risk of spreading infection.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chrislepkowski @gavin_poulton Yes I agree - we need to upgrade in central defence!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@barryd19651 @nick_wba Bartley isn't a bad player in my opinion but he's "accident prone" which is disastrous in PL! Make a mistake &amp; opponents score!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 I probably liked the Regis era shirt best, followed by the one with long white sleeves in the late 60's.

<|startoftext|>@histevegray No it isn't....ü§£ü§£ü§£<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ Don't like irregular stripes! Can't help it, doesn't seem right to me - I'm a bit traditional where Baggies kits are concerned! I presume, if away kit is green &amp; yellow, it'll be same design!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @cllrfranoborski Absolutely correct! Goebbels would be proud of them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not generally bothered by our kits - if they're a variation on traditional blue &amp; white stripes, I'm happy, but...I always really disliked the "bar code" kit in the 90's &amp; we've now almost gone back to it!

<|startoftext|>@HurricaneHic147 Our outstanding first half of season set it up for us!

<|startoftext|>@DaveBSmith Lol - just need the players to turn up - that would be a good start!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattyashmore Certainly they have a slot for one game - don't know if they'll show 2 &amp; switch between or use 2 channels<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baggieant64 Always felt Brentford would drop points somewhere but after last night I thought they'd win today! Maybe our defeat raised the pressure levels for them a bit too much!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ @getpromotionpr Remarkable! Twists &amp; turns I never expected!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baggieant64 Really didn't see that coming!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybill82 Don't deserve any sympathy if we don't!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StigsWBACousin I'll be doing the same.....one way or the other!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ How are your stress levels? üòÅ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybill82 Looks like we've got a second chance! Can't blow it twice....can we?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stevotop Never do anything the easy way!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rjdowning You called that one right Richard! If I'm Mystic Howard, you're now Mystic Richard! üòÅüëç<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ Isn't it! I've had this on a regular basis since I was 9! A year or two now! Its part of being a Baggie!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ Agree - but I'd avoided looking until a couple of minutes ago and just seen Stoke are winning....we can still hope...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simonjedge @benjamincohen @PinkNews @mypinknews Well said Simon - a great thread!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jastle68 Worth reflecting that Brentford have won 8 in a row! If they'd won, say, 5 &amp; drawn 3, we'd be promoted now, despite our indifferent form since lockdown! Remarkable form, under pressure, by any standards, from Brentford! Losing to them was probably the critical result! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Butroswba @baggiesanal @Geordiebaggie I agree. Thought his after game interview yesterday was very revealing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Butroswba @baggiesanal @Geordiebaggie Yes - I think frustration is greater than it might have been if we'd had an average season &amp; just got into playoffs! Trouble is, we've been on top all season &amp; faded at the end! That feels like failure!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@m28246491 Lol - are you feeling ok this morning?  Seriously though, I hope you're right! There are always unexpected results - I hope that could be one! üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jackalbion @AshRamian Last season in PL wage bill was over ¬£90m! We cut that by about 50% after relegation! It needs cutting again if we're still in Championship next season! Any signings would need funding through sales! We don't have many that would get a big fee! We haven't paid for Pereira yet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jackalbion @AshRamian Total income, not just parachute payment! It was also a generous figure, so may be nearer ¬£30m, but I saw somewhere current wage bill is ¬£40m+. Fact is, I agree with you - failure to up this season will mean current squad is unsustainable! Massive reduction in overheads needed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshRamian @Jackalbion I think our income, if gate money returns soon (unlikely), with the last year of parachute payment, will be about ¬£40m next season! That is less than we are currently paying in wages! The current squad being retained is unsustainable! Still some big earners who will have to go!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@raihennefer @chrislepkowski @PRDH1975 @D_Ooshcruft @SteveMadeley78 That's exactly the problem! We haven't had anything like promotion form since Christmas! We're only still in the frame because of first half of season when we were outstanding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ Yes - don't think we've won promotion that way since Ardiles team have we?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brynbaggie Yes - if defenders know a keeper controls his area, less chance they try panicky clearances. But I agree, his confidence has gone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brynbaggie I was a keeper &amp; never moan at them, but he doesn't command his area the way he should! I'll leave it there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybill82 We had Gayle &amp; Rodriguez last season, who were prolific, but didn't really replace them! We paid ¬£8m for Zohore from Cardiff &amp; he's been woeful - doesn't even make the bench now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybill82 Its been a gradual decline since Christmas! I think we were on 50 points after 23 games! Only 32 mores in next 22!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie Sadly I agree! West Ham fan I know said to me in January, "SB is a great manager when he gets it right, but if you fall away, he loses the plot!" I laughed! Seems he was right!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getpromotionpr I believe our current wage bill is bigger than our total annual turnover next season! This squad was only affordable if we went up this year! Don't think it has the "grit" to win the playoffs! Oh how I hope I'm wrong!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie The lack of pace, tempo &amp; urgency since we started again has been noticeable. Lost that swagger we had!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All started to fall apart with that last minute equaliser by Barnsley on Boxing Day. Home defeats against Middlesbrough, Wigan &amp; too many draws over the season! Only 7 defeats is impressive, but you have to kill teams off! We haven't too many times! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybill82 Looks like we'll be playing you next season then! Well done - you deserve the win!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We've been a shadow of the team we were up to Christmas! One defeat in the first 23 was outstanding! Generally average second half of season! Certainly not promotion form! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every forward pass of more than about 10 yds is given away! Absolutely no cutting edge! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is utter dross - slow build up - playing short passes, trying to go through middle of a deep, packed defence! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Piss poor defending again! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie @huntywbafc If he clicks today, he could be a match winner - if he doesn't, he's a passenger!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@huntywbafc I wouldn't.....probably the after affects of too much whisky at lunchtime....! üòÅüòá<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm excited more than apprehensive at the moment! Hope it isn't a false dawn! #wecandothis #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stevotop Exactly my fear too! Without PL money next season we'll have to really reduce the current wage bill. Then we'll have a huge job on to make another challenge as strong as this season. I don't see fans returning before Christmas &amp; possibly not next season at all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybill82 We'll be very nervous! We over elaborate in build up a bit too much &amp; don't score so get a bit anxious, need to be more direct!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke Quite. The clubs future for next few years, at least, is on the line with promotion this season! If we don't, I don't see our better players still being here next season! We'll need to cash in &amp; significantly cut the wage bill! Anyway....onwards &amp; upwards...time for positivity!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 Absolutely right! If we don't go up this season, our income next season is only about ¬£40m! Just pushes us back into the pack with other Championship sides &amp; keeping the players we want will be unsustainable!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizJRudd I know the feeling - I'm a Kentish Beer (name not drink!) through my paternal grandmother. Family owned the George Beer &amp; Ridgen brewery which is now part of Shepherd Neame! No benefits have filtered down....sadly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Makes you think....these next two games can guarantee us another ¬£100m+ in income next season  - will be so important in the future of the club with gate income unlikely to return any time soon! We can do this - starting tonight! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@huntywbafc Great news......er.......I think? ü§£ü§£ü§£üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizJRudd Lol - didn't know you had pork butchers in the family! I don't think calling them "extra thick" is a particularly good marketing ploy though! üòâüòä<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We move more &amp; more under the control &amp; influence of the US! Our biggest trade deal will be with them, we're cutting our political &amp; favoured trade relationship with EU, alienating the Chinese because US says so! Far from taking back sovereignty, we're giving it away! #51ststate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveBSmith Yes - I'll consult the tea leaves before Friday! ü§£ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanPGlasgow Yep - spooky isn't it! üòâü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Strange half! No real intensity from Baggies. Sitting back a bit &amp; letting Fulham come onto them! Think it might be intentional. Can see us step it up second half....hopefully!! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daiseyrai Tut!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rjdowning Funny side Stoke! Rubbish a lot of the time, then they suddenly pull out an unexpected result! Hope you're right!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rjdowning I've felt Brentford must drop some points somewhere too &amp; probably when least expected! If they don't, they deserve to go up! Their run is very similar to Villa's last season!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@magneticsparrow What? Half pissed! ü§£ü§£ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CyrilleBrown I'll go with your feelings then! üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanPGlasgow I'd take anything but defeat! We're still in driving seat if we don't lose!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@magneticsparrow You reckon? I've had a couple of large whiskys - they work pretty well!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getpromotionpr Actually, I'd take that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ind_Broker Yep - I will too about half past 4!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes, before important games, I get a strong feeling of success or impending doom - often its right! Today? Absolutely nothing! Strange! Don't know what to expect! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpankyPantry @EssexCanning And every time you take them off they should be changed for a new one or binned or washed, since any infection on them will have transferred to your hands, which should also be washed! You obviously don't understand the point of infection control!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexCanning Fine, no problem with it, but.....you can't wear them in pubs &amp; restaurants, for obvious reasons, where close proximity is similar to shops, so its all a bit pointless....it just moves the location of possible infection!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies @TheRainbowStand Yep - remember seeing Dickinson in a reserve game &amp; he was in a shocking mood! He did a truly a awful foul, waved bye-bye &amp; was down the tunnel before ref had time to get red card out of pocket! Premeditated foul, if ever I saw one! ü§£ü§£ü§£<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jackalbion Brunt could still do a job later in game, if needed. I really didn't understand why Slav used Harper, he isn't an "impact" player &amp; seems to lack any "intensity" - wasn't going to change the game! Apart from Austin (who's in &amp; out), we've lacked a real goal scorer all season!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jackalbion Not losing is a must - defeat would be very worrying &amp; probably see us out of top 2 on goal difference, then its no longer in our hands. Obviously prefer a win though, but with 2 winnable games still to come, 2 wins sees us go up, even if Brentford win their last 3!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@getpromotionpr I didn't see game. Don't really mind if Leeds win league or us, but I'd get a pang of pleasure seeing Stoke continuing down the league! Really don't like the club.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybill82 Needs survival - then kick on next season! Relegation would be hard to recover from in terms of confidence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybill82 How do you rate your manager? Strongly linked with us before we appointed Bilic. I rated him highly for what he'd achieved at Lincoln &amp; would have been pleased to have him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybill82 Yes I think 6 will be enough too. I think you'll probably be OK if you beat Luton! Leeds did you a big favour tonight too! Must be hard for a Huddersfield fan to be grateful to Leeds, but needs must ay?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie Exactly - all this gloom cos Stoke got stuffed &amp; Leeds boosted goal difference is pointless! Its what we do that matters!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never mind what Leeds did today, we go up with 8pts more from last 4 games, irrespective if Brentford get max points from theirs! If they draw one, 6pts is enough for us! If we don't do it now, we don't deserve promotion. Its in our hands! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhitstableKM Commendable &amp; welcome to help reduce anti social behaviour - but I thought much of the beach in #whitstable was in the private ownership of the Oyster Fishery Company?

<|startoftext|>@Albion_2020 Pressure on Brentford to achieve that will be huge! If they do it, they deserve promotion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett Yes - I think 6 points could be enough, but I think 8 would make certain. Big test for Brentford at Derby! Derby need the win to keep play off hopes alive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Albion_2020 Yes I agree. Brentford have had a great season &amp; deserve to go up. Never been a Leeds fan, its historical  for me, but they've been excellent this season too, so also deserve promotion! Hopefully the 3 of us will make it!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Stevotop Wasn't he! So much pace too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybill82 Yes I agree. They've won 5 in a row now &amp; it would be remarkable for them to win all 9.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Grosicki reads the game so well! He makes some great runs off the ball! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybill82 He joined in January till end of season, as cover. First time he's made the bench. I've always liked him too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pressing very high! Not giving Derby time to build anything! Need to be cautious of a quick counter! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great finish! #WBA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@getpromotionpr @gemmadowneswba Yes...helplessness is what it is! I feel even worse listening on radio when I can't actually SEE what's happening!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray My wife has a Fiesta, lovely car. The Puma is based on the Fiesta chassis  but its a bigger body &amp; partially a hybrid &amp; equipment level is stunning. Last car was a Mondeo, great drive, but fed up with bigger cars &amp; a aldo diesel, wanted to go back to petrol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gemmadowneswba Funnily enough - I always feel more apprehensive &amp; tense watching on TV than I ever do actually being at the ground! Strange.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well this is a first...watching a Test Match in mid summer &amp; in an hour watching the Baggies in a league game! Crazy times! #WBAvDCFC #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray A Ford Puma ST Line+ - amazed what a lovely car it is when I had a test drive &amp; that was in the 125. Mines the 155. Boy racer!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ Thanks - but that hasn't gone well! They've now told me it needs an "unexpected" software update, so it won't be today!! Good start! Baggies better not let me down at 5 o'clock! Miffed now! üòè<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke @carolecadwalla Quite - I had a mate i worked with, who had been to Russia on holiday &amp; couldn't even get low grade security clearance because they couldn't be sure he hadn't been "compromised" while he was there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke @carolecadwalla I'd presume he must have been PV'd (positive vetted by security) - inconceivable he hasn't! I had a high security clearance when I worked in government, but wasn't allowed in the most secret bit when I visited an arms manufacturer once! This guy seems to be able to do anything!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brynbaggie Deja vu!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenWFLabour People have this misguided belief WTO terms are to be welcomed! They aren't! The reason countries do deals with each other is to get more favourable terms that those offered by WTO! They won't offer UK anything that aids trade!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brynbaggie Haha - yea but imagine sitting in car pushing all the buttons &amp; by mistake dropping on WM just in time to hear Bomber say " and thats 4 now for Derby - Baggies really haven't turned up tonight!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gemmabaggies I think, from what you've said about Chris, he wouldn't want Harrison to be sad on his birthday. I am sure he'd want him to be happy &amp; enjoy his day.

<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @artoflabour They've got the M20 for a car park already Steve! You should see that when the French customs or port workers are on strike! They call it Operation Stack!

<|startoftext|>@Rickshaw40S Thanks Richard - my family roots there go back to the 17th century, so it's in my blood!

<|startoftext|>@artoflabour *vehicle* - whoops!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@artoflabour 2.9 million goods verhicle movements a year through Dover currently, according to official government figures, on RoRo ferries - all without customs checks - all will soon need customs checks! Unbelievable chaos looms! No other UK port comes close to that number of vehicles!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just seen our game tomorrow is at 5 o'clock! That had completely passed me by! Doesn't matter really cos it is on tv, but just thinking, what time is that in Australia for Oz baggies, if you've got to get up for it? #wba<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Reynox78 @TaffieBaggie @Jackalbion Absolutely! Be a remarkable achievement!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mac123_m @BorisJohnson This is what rampant hypocrisy looks like in action!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie @Jackalbion Yes - I meant we need to pick up one more point from our games than Leeds because we're one point behind them - not we need to finish one point ahead of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baggiestex @Jackalbion Yep - there'll be a surprise or two yet - Brentford have easiest games on paper, but 9 wins on the bounce, as the pressure builds, is a massive task! They'd deserve promotion if they do it! If they lose/draw one game, we only need 8/9pts. All the time its in our hands I'm happy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jackalbion Or we need one point more than Leeds...! This is about 2 from 3 going up, it isn't just us or Brentford!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AubreyMilkshake @JonesCitizen Yes - I agree totally! Not a lot to add - you've summed it up perfectly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chefdeals @JonesCitizen Simple answer is - I don't know at the moment!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardJMurphy @valmayes Thats because it supports capitalist private enterprise but doesn't really want a state funded NHS that benefits all! Save one - let the other fail though lack of proper funding! A major part of the basic Tory ideology! Profit before people!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chefdeals @JonesCitizen Doesn't really matter that much who I vote for in Wyre Forest! Blair &amp; his cohorts destroyed strong Labour support here with their decimation of Kidderminster Hospital! That support doesn't come back locally! Totally safe Tory seat now! Still don't like Blair or Blairites!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonesCitizen They've lost me in just 3 months - pretty impressive really when were supposed to be on the same side! #redtories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the plus side....a win tomorrow &amp; we guarantee a play off place! üëçüòâ  One step at a time....! #onwardsandupwards #JustSaying #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoWhitstable @TheShipWhit No - should have been down about now, but on hold for obvious reasons. Hopefully get a trip in September/October time when things have settled down a bit! Missing the town terribly now though!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chefdeals @ArtCrunchy @Lovehasnowords1 Agree - I have a completely different perception when I see in someone's bio, the Union Flag with the EU flag together! As I said, its all about what it makes me think &amp; that isn't about opinions, its about perceptions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArtCrunchy @chefdeals @Lovehasnowords1 Exactly - I didn't say I had a problem with it - I was pointing out that I agreed with the perception that had grown in recent times that using the Union Flag &amp; Cross of St George had been taken over by the "right". That had also become my perception! It wasn't bias or snobbery!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lovehasnowords1 @ArtCrunchy I think the original post wasn't about displaying flags per se! It was about flags logos ipeople's twitter profiles, which had originally been done mainly by those highlighted! Its much more universal now, but still has an association, from its origins, with the "right!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jbmelectrical @WhitstableLive I think it was probably pulled down in the mid 70's - it may have closed even earlier &amp; been derelict for a time! A lot of "tidying up" of #Whitstable about then! Also pulled down a row of derelict shops at Starvation Point - appalling they were!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@baggieant64 @Otto_English Quite - think the police are in for a busy weekend!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaCraik64 @Otto_English Bacon sandwiches &amp; a pint?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getpromotionpr @LucyMPowell @Ed_Miliband The establishment agenda is always about making it better for the "haves" not the "have nots". They achieve it by convincing the "have nots" they are really doing it for them! Very clever marketing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getpromotionpr @LucyMPowell @Ed_Miliband Quite! Sadly, in simple terms, people think if they can go to pub tomorrow &amp; Spain in August, everything is ok again! It isn't, it will get a lot worse yet &amp; not just with the virus! Govt could easily suspend Brexit in this current situation &amp; sensible people would understand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Otto_English First opening on a Saturday is brain dead...guaranteed to cause a rush to the head for many! Opening on Monday &amp; letting places/people start more "slowly" on a week day &amp; "learn" how to operate before a weekend, made more strategic sense! But strategic sense &amp; Govt are strangers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucyMPowell @Ed_Miliband I fear for the UK - the affects of #Covid19UK have only been "medical" so far, the real damage will come as the economy contracts with more businesses failing &amp; people becoming unemployed! Add to this, potentially no trade deal with EU by winter &amp; results could be catastrophic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaggieYamYamDan @B_H_Baggie Yep - when I was a kid (before social media...by a long way...!) me &amp; my mates, who were mainly Blues &amp; Villa fans, met up on Sunday morning &amp; pick apart what we'd seen at the games on Saturday - our dads did it in the pub! If you don't both praise &amp; moan you ain't a fan imho!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B_H_Baggie Absolutely right - I do the same! Makes me very frustrated if I comment &amp; people say I'm "not a real fan" if I'm critical! Fans have criticised &amp; praised teams, players since football began - that's what fans do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ @RobPaddockWBA Lol - think they've gone on hols if tonight was anything to go by!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobPaddockWBA I'd say thats a good thing! Imagine us being the team they ended a lousy run against!  Think the meltdown would have been world beating! üòÑüòÑüòÑ Now they've won they can go back to losing again on Sunday!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LesleyB65 @HairyAngus Sorry - best I could manage - too early in the day! üòÅüòÅ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Absolutely right - we'll be back in full lock down by August! Madness! Imagine reopening pubs on a summer Saturday! Brain dead! Should have reopened on a Monday so they have a week to get into a routine before facing a weekend! I'm still being very careful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @LesleyB65 Thats a limp joke....even for you! üòâüëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenWFLabour Sad Steve - my daughter is an actress &amp; writer &amp; she had a week lined up to have a play she has written performed in the autumn at a major venue! The arts will really suffer in this with live audiences still a long way off!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billericaybaggy Good luck Ian! I took (very) early retirement from the Civil Service over 20 years ago to do my own thing - people told me I was mad to give up the security - I wasn't &amp; I never regretted it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WestBromEL @PhilTonks2 Yes thats my point - boys nights out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WestBromEL @PhilTonks2 Just wondering what's going to happen when someone is refused entry to a pub that looks half empty but is following Govt guidelines on social distancing &amp; limiting its numbers! Don't think this will end well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisjdownes Happy Anniversary! üëçüòÅ Mind you, you do both look about 12! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"'Raise a glass': UK Treasury faces backlash after hailing pubs reopening on Saturday"  https://t.co/jt4L7wNscb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybill82 Yes - well pleased with that! Now maybe we can do you a favour on Sunday - we've got Hull at the Hawthorns!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Fletch__ Yep - I was still really worried till we scored but the boost to confidence that gave the team may have saved the season!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billericaybaggy Yep! Onwards &amp; upwards!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Newman247 Yes - can't slip back again now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Quinlan1989 Funny thing confidence! Different side to first half!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Huge result this! Will be a big boost to confidence! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray Metaphorically I presume.....? üòâüòÑ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe thats the boost they needed  - massive moment! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We couldn't score in a brothel! Worth reflecting that Blues have conceded 3 goals in each of two home games against Hull &amp; Huddersfield &amp; we hardly managed a shot against them at home! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybill82 Yes very worrying for them. Made such a good recovery on pitch after looking awful up to Christmas! Getting very tight near top now - we need a performance. Big game tonight<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@curious_kent @jeffhunt14 How would that work if you were 44, 55, 66........? üòÅ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getpromotionpr @smethwickender1 Fabulous back 4. Think Ally might have played for Scotland in a different era, but they weren't in favour of picking too many England based players then &amp; sometimes chose an inferior player with a Scottish club over one with an English club.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BFCQWERTY @TaffieBaggie Sadly you are right - but clubs like Bury, Wigan &amp; probably others soon, deserve the right to exist. Its scandalous really that a months money that some top players get would run some clubs for a season!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie I think they'll be the first of many! I can't see fans at games again until after Christmas, if then. PL clubs are cushioned by TV millions, but lower league clubs income is mainly gate revenue! No income, eventually no club! Worrying, cos football isn't just about the big boys!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaggieAnalytics Do it &amp; if you do, apologise and delete it! üòÅüòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffhunt14 I'm over 70 but been told I act like a 2 year old! Is that the same? üòâüòÅ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevkeywba @chrislepkowski Yes - I'm not sure what results they had in their others games, but if they didn't finish the season, all their results are removed from season so far - so it could charge league positions! If, for instance, Leeds beat them twice, Leeds lose 6 points! We lost at home to them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sbaggieboy60 @smethwickender1 Lol - now its all coming out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getpromotionpr @smethwickender1 Ally is in my all all time, personal favourite Albion 11! It would differ slightly from my "Albion best 11" - but, probably my personal favourites are more important to me than "the best" I've seen play for club!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevkeywba @chrislepkowski Motivation for players won't be easy when, if they don't resolve it quickly,  they could be liquidated &amp; cease to exist - players then out of work!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislepkowski And don't Wigan play Brentford on Saturday? So with a cloud like that hanging over them after the good form they've recently shown being pointless, are they going to be "up for it" like they would have been? I think not@<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislepkowski Not going to claim to be wise after the event - but this was always a possibility, after a 3 month season suspension, if it started again &amp; Wigan will be the first of many imo! It will skew the final table! Playing out the season was fraught with potential banana skins!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Made my morning üòÑüòÑüòÑ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie @smethwickender1 Yes we had a team that really should have won cup that year!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffreyMorris3 @smethwickender1 Yes - Ipswich weren't a bad side but Ron got his team selection totally wrong that day - against  QPR we were just awful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smethwickender1 Remember being there that day &amp; JW must have headed the ball 100 times with that bandage on his bleeding head! Absolute hero &amp; one I would really call a club legend!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jay89R Yes that's my view - my tweet meant to say Krov in middle &amp; Pereira wide but I worded it sloppily! üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jay89R I agree we need to try something different. We're fine defensively but lost creative cutting edge - seemed to play too square at Brentford with no real pace or width - tried to go through middle too much! Just don't think he'll change formation - maybe start Krov &amp; Pereira wide?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybill82 Haven't seen who you have still to play - apart from us. Stoke &amp; Luton look poor  - surprised Leeds didn't win tonight, but the pressure seems to be a great leveller<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPridsta Yep - let's hope it stays that way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baggiestex Fulham &amp; Albion had something to play for against them too..... they came through that ok! But, yes, I take your point - all "pressure" games.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whoops - I meant Sunday...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybill82 Before lockdown it was a home banker....now I'll be very nervous! We aren't playing badly &amp; we're still hard to score against, but our urgency &amp; tempo going forward has gone &amp; we're not creating the chances! Hope we do it for both of us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Need a performance tomorrow &amp; Saturday! If we do, nothing has changed &amp; we're still in driving seat! It's a three horse race for two places if we don't! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus I love the Dutch &amp; Belgians. Stopped to get petrol in Holland &amp; went to pay - the cashier was speaking to me in Dutch &amp; when I spoke back to him in English, he apologised for not speaking to me in English first &amp; "how rude I must think him towards a visitor to our country!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus I hate Brits abroad! I was in a cafe in Amsterdam about 15 years ago having lunch and a group of 4 Brits were obnoxious - arrogant &amp; really rude to the owner! When they left I said to the owner how embarrassing I found them &amp; said were not all like that! See it so often!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus I saw woman on twitter other day saying she was so glad we were leaving &amp; we'd be better off without "all these eastern Europeans" coming here to work &amp; when she retired she was going to live in Spain! She was traumatised when the problem with her relocating was pointed out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Absolutely brilliant! The "thickfulness" of some people is stunning! Didn't Farage make it clear that leaving EU removed the rights that loads had as a result of membership - I'm sure he covered that problem when he got German passports for his kids.....!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hero_Taylor9 Imagine making the final squad ahead of some of the utter dross we've had over the years!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie Thanks Chris.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MAF79 Not for me - seen his best day's I think! We do need a top keeper though, if we do go up, to really challenge SJ &amp; I see Bond being released. Palmer looks a really good prospect, but probably as No 3 next season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanielleStretch @planetdebra @McdonaldSaiiy I'm glad you both came through it! It certainly isn't a virus to be taken lightly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@planetdebra @DanielleStretch @McdonaldSaiiy I think much of the problem stemmed from the original line of "it's like a bad dose of the flu, most won't even know they've had it!"

<|startoftext|>@McdonaldSaiiy @planetdebra Quite - I'm certainly not doing more than is absolutely essential! They told me I was in the "at risk" category &amp; whilst I haven't fully shielded, I've been very careful! That won't change!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@planetdebra The timing to coincide with the start of the traditional summer holidays period &amp; likely good weather was an economic decision, not a scientific one &amp; was particularly cynical!

<|startoftext|>@JeffreyMorris3 @phoenixbaggie There are a lot of older fans who haven't been contacted, from what I understand. It's a shame, because it was a lovely initiative by the club &amp; appreciated by those they have phoned (some repeatedly) - but it all seems a bit haphazard &amp; random the way they've gone about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@phoenixbaggie I'm pleased for you, I can imagine what lovely lift it must have given you, but I'm still waiting for that first call Sandra......disappointed after being a supporter since 1955 &amp; STH since 1977!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Richbaggies @huntywbafc Quite - I lived in Hall Green/Acocks Green area &amp; all mates were Villa or Blues fans - I was a lone Baggie! Wolves were irrelevant, it was Villa I saw as our big rivals! Still is for me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baggiestex Not a PL manager - good run when he took over last season &amp; got a mid table championship squad peomoted! Just think...there were loads of Baggies fans wanted him to replace Pulis before Moore was appointed! Bullet dodged thankfully!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@juliewassmer @GoWhitstable @RosieJpoet @sw_delaney @itvmeridian @canterburycc @SarahJLonsdale @dianelangford @WhitstableLive @Whitproduce @sally_laker @itv_sarah @gezatkinson @thenativebubble @MattHancock @Kent_Online One final observation, cos I'm too far removed currently to know the full facts &amp; action being taken but... don't say to the police/council, "we've got a problem, ain't it awful, what are you going to do?" Instead try "we've got a problem, this is what we think you should do!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juliewassmer @GoWhitstable @RosieJpoet @sw_delaney @itvmeridian @canterburycc @SarahJLonsdale @dianelangford @WhitstableLive @Whitproduce @sally_laker @itv_sarah @gezatkinson @thenativebubble @MattHancock @Kent_Online Absolutely! A "bottom up", community driven group would be a good start to promote action! CCC will argue they are skint too, but if you can reduce the level of antisocial behaviour &amp; litter, they don't have to pick it up &amp; that saves them money! Start with cause not result.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoWhitstable @RosieJpoet @sw_delaney @juliewassmer @itvmeridian @canterburycc @SarahJLonsdale @dianelangford @WhitstableLive @Whitproduce @sally_laker @itv_sarah @gezatkinson @thenativebubble @MattHancock @Kent_Online You shouldn't have to fight this yourselves! Having dealt with similar issues elsewhere as both cllr &amp; Council Leader, your elected representatives, Councillors &amp; MP, should be leading on this! They may well be, I don't know, so I'm not judging, but its huge issue &amp; needs action!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoWhitstable @RosieJpoet @sw_delaney @juliewassmer @itvmeridian @canterburycc @SarahJLonsdale @dianelangford @WhitstableLive @Whitproduce @sally_laker @itv_sarah @gezatkinson @thenativebubble @MattHancock @Kent_Online Thanks, then police are at fault by not using the powers they have, but they would probably argue is about "resources" &amp; "funding" which is fair comment! Local County &amp;/or District Councillors should be putting pressure on for action! Do you have local PACT's as a starting point?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RosieJpoet @GoWhitstable @sw_delaney @juliewassmer @itvmeridian @canterburycc @SarahJLonsdale @dianelangford @WhitstableLive @Whitproduce @sally_laker @itv_sarah @gezatkinson @thenativebubble @MattHancock @Kent_Online Yes - my suggestion was just an example. Can have several, each covering specific areas! I've seen them used to great effect &amp; it enables the police to take immediate, on the spot, action! Saves them a lot of time not having to "charge" people &amp; very cost effective! It works!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonesCitizen Thanks - I will!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonesCitizen Stairway to Heaven by Heart! Stunning cover! Not knocking LZ version of course, but even Robert Plant rated this highly!<|endoftext|>

Outdoor drinking at Neptune &amp; other outlets not harmed because legally licensed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RosieJpoet @GoWhitstable @sw_delaney @juliewassmer @itvmeridian @canterburycc @SarahJLonsdale @dianelangford @WhitstableLive @Whitproduce @sally_laker @itv_sarah @gezatkinson @thenativebubble @MattHancock @Kent_Online There is a partial solution that's been used in anti social hot spots in many places in UK, an outdoor alcohol banning order! Gives police power to confiscate "open" alcohol from anyone in possession &amp; throw it away! Very effective, easy to apply, reduces crowds/litter &amp; works!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanNash86 Quite - creativity yesterday was none existent! In fairness to Zohore, he had one half chance 20yds out &amp; managed a great shot which hit the bar! Don't recall HRK having any pass to feet - just chasing hopeful punts forward - poor team performance all round.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett @AshBurty Yea - that's my opinion too! I thought 4 wins &amp; couple of draws would be enough with 9 to play! Still of that opinion! And you're right about Brentford - it's a big ask!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshBurty Absolutely. Haven't been too worried about our blip last 2 games, but we need a performance in games this week! I'd actually take a point on Wednesday, prefer 3 obviously, but I'd be very worried indeed if we don't win next Saturday!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshBurty We need 4 wins in 7 with maybe a draw added, imo. I think the important thing is to stay ahead &amp; not need a final sprint, depending on others to lose, in last few games! Agree next 2 games hugely important!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billericaybaggy Just been involved in discussion about litter in Whitstable &amp; getting moaned at for saying it's very much a flaw in (some) people that's  impossible to stop &amp; being told I'm negative &amp; defeatist! However suggesting people will change if you "ask them nicely" isn't a solution!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VickyNewham @SusanAmos1 @ChrisShdtch @m28246491 @canterburycc @shopbythesea @GoWhitstable @kentpolicecbury @RosieDuffield1 @WhitstableKM @kentlife @WhitstableHarbr 2/2 You won't change that behaviour by asking them to pick up their litter &amp; respect the local community, because they don't! As I said, it's in their psyche &amp; the "me first" society that's been cultivated in UK for years! It needs a cultural shift, not  treating the outcome!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VickyNewham @SusanAmos1 @ChrisShdtch @m28246491 @canterburycc @shopbythesea @GoWhitstable @kentpolicecbury @RosieDuffield1 @WhitstableKM @kentlife @WhitstableHarbr We don't fundamentally disagree  but this issue has been a problem for police &amp; councils for years! All the "why don't you's" have been tried &amp; failed because too many of the people who do it are ignorant, arrogant, rude &amp; don't give a toss about anything but themselves! 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VickyNewham @SusanAmos1 @ChrisShdtch @m28246491 @canterburycc @shopbythesea @GoWhitstable @kentpolicecbury @RosieDuffield1 @WhitstableKM @kentlife @WhitstableHarbr To answer my own question - the only real way is to make all people carry ID cards which law requires they must show, on demand, to council officials who have the right to see it for the purposes of issuing a spot fine! Perfect solution but public outrage at ID cards suggestion?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VickyNewham @SusanAmos1 @ChrisShdtch @m28246491 @canterburycc @shopbythesea @GoWhitstable @kentpolicecbury @RosieDuffield1 @WhitstableKM @kentlife @WhitstableHarbr Its neither negative or defeatist, it's a an observation &amp; a statement of fact! Only police can prosecute &amp; for offences like those we are witnessing, they actually have to catch the person in the act! How do you monitor the actions of all the people in a huge crowd all the time?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getpromotionpr Agree with all that! There was always a nagging worry in my mind that with 3 months off, restart would be like a new season &amp; we wouldn't carry on as before! Sadly we do look a totally different side in 2 games so far!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sbaggieboy60 Absolutely! Very poor &amp; if they do get a cross in its behind the play!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too much time spent trying to go through the middle of a tight defence instead of getting wide &amp; trying to get in behind! Just like against Blues! So easy to defend against! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would help if we got the ball and kept it for a bit! #WBA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Sbaggieboy60 Just going to tweet that...you beat me to it!  (The last bit about the changes) üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getpromotionpr Poor - no punch or cutting edge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billericaybaggy @daiseyrai Yep - going through the motions - no fire!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daiseyrai Frustrating isn't it! When we're on song wide, we're really potent but against Blues &amp; tonight we're not getting behind them! Punchless!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daiseyrai Very laborious &amp; over elaborate isn't it! Absolutely no threat going forward! Last time we looked decent was away at Bristol City. #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie First rule of goal keeping in my days between the sticks "use your hands!"   Times have changed so much in keeping &amp; not for the better in my opinion!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh dear - does anyone else think Sam should have cut that out - he sort of stuck a foot out but it was very half hearted - poor defence all round for that though! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosephMasi_Star Lol - "it says in my contract I do match announcements at home games &amp; that's exactly what I'm going to do, crowd or no crowd!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sbaggieboy60 @griffraces @bluntroger Yes but playing in a friendly doesn't necessarily mean he's fully match fit for action yet. He could still be a bit behind the rest! The strange thing is the club don't say why he isn't involved!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@griffraces @bluntroger Excellent! üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@griffraces @bluntroger No - strange club don't say something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@griffraces @bluntroger He played &amp; scored in the friendly against Villa, so not quarantined.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@magneticsparrow Yep - another one for the list!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@curious_kent Quite - grammar was a big thing at my school! Accents &amp; dialects are part of who we are &amp; variations are fine, but written English should be "correct" -  only my opinion  I know, but bad usage really annoys me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanAmos1 @ChrisShdtch @m28246491 @canterburycc @shopbythesea @GoWhitstable @kentpolicecbury @RosieDuffield1 @WhitstableKM @kentlife @WhitstableHarbr Absolutely &amp; schools try very hard to teach young ones good habits but it seems to go wrong as they get older!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanAmos1 @ChrisShdtch @m28246491 @canterburycc @shopbythesea @GoWhitstable @kentpolicecbury @RosieDuffield1 @WhitstableKM @kentlife @WhitstableHarbr I respect your faith but reminding someone full of 6 pints of lager &amp; itching for trouble to pick up discarded fish &amp; chip wrappers isn't  going to "change their behaviour!"<|endoftext|>

That's about people with no standards, self respect or concern for anyone but themselves! However,  I agree totally with your last sentence! What a time we live in!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VickyNewham @SusanAmos1 @ChrisShdtch @m28246491 @canterburycc @shopbythesea @GoWhitstable @kentpolicecbury @RosieDuffield1 @WhitstableKM @kentlife @WhitstableHarbr I'm not making excuses, I'm highlighting the fact that councils across the country battle this problem daily &amp; have been for years! Remember "Keep Britain Tidy" 40 odd years ago? We're still trying - because it's in the British psyche - it isn't the same in most other countries!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VickyNewham @SusanAmos1 @ChrisShdtch @m28246491 @canterburycc @shopbythesea @GoWhitstable @kentpolicecbury @RosieDuffield1 @WhitstableKM @kentlife @WhitstableHarbr Fact is other councils haven't stamped it out! And anti social behaviour &amp; litter are two different issues! One is a police matter - the other is a civil matter! Police can't fine for littering - unless the law has changed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VickyNewham @SusanAmos1 @ChrisShdtch @m28246491 @canterburycc @shopbythesea @GoWhitstable @kentpolicecbury @RosieDuffield1 @WhitstableKM @kentlife @WhitstableHarbr Enforcement officers have limited powers in law when issueing fines (which, like parking fines, can't be collected on the spot) - they need a name/address to mailout a fine demand! Do you think those dropping litter will give details to a council officer? Imagine the response!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VickyNewham @SusanAmos1 @ChrisShdtch @m28246491 @canterburycc @shopbythesea @GoWhitstable @kentpolicecbury @RosieDuffield1 @WhitstableKM @kentlife @WhitstableHarbr 2/2 And as someone who actually ran a council with a huge tourist footfall, believe me it is an appalling problem to try and address! I know the problems that Whitstable has every summer weekend, but it isn't going to stop when it is, very sadly, the way too many people behave!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VickyNewham @SusanAmos1 @ChrisShdtch @m28246491 @canterburycc @shopbythesea @GoWhitstable @kentpolicecbury @RosieDuffield1 @WhitstableKM @kentlife @WhitstableHarbr Yes I agree - on the spot fines is a real answer, but actually seeing someone do it is the problem in law for council to manage! How many enforcement officers would you need in Whitstable on a summer weekend? One or two wouldn't address it! 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Common cold doesn't kill so they don't search too hard. Flu jab is updated every year because the virus changes, so its possible to keep up with mutations! Pneumonia virus changes too, but they produced a "one off" vaccine for that - so options should be possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus I agree - until a vaccine is proved effective there will be no end to this!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StephenWFLabour I've heard, from a pretty trustworthy source, that hospital admissions are going up again but the figures are being suppressed! Relaxing lockdown, with figures still so high, just at the start of the holiday season, is an economic decision, not a scientific one! Madness!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanAmos1 @ChrisShdtch @m28246491 @canterburycc @shopbythesea @GoWhitstable @kentpolicecbury @RosieDuffield1 @WhitstableKM @kentlife @WhitstableHarbr I'm from Whitstable originally but live in Worcestershire now! Was a local councillor here for 14 years in a district with 2 heavily visited tourist towns on River Severn! The cost of cleaning up rubbish left behind was frightening! It's in the Brit psyche, sadly it wont stop!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Useless Eustace on tv now! #bbcnews #environmentsecretary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenWFLabour Yep - crowds at live events &amp; sport a long way off! People moaning that  night clubs etc not opening then show how they can be "trusted" by Bournemouth yesterday! Just waiting for trouble when pubs open! Turn up somewhere half empty &amp; get refused admission! That'll go down well!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Difficult to see how/when unrestricted attendance at theatres &amp; sporting events will be possible again? Seriously worrying for both sectors. Realistically, for instance, can see next football season totally fanless! 300,000+ attending every weekend just too risky! ##bbcbreakfast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sbaggieboy60 Good luck with that Shaun! Take care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sbaggieboy60 I'm fine thanks Shaun - being very careful still &amp; don't go far, but not really bothered by that at the moment. Hope all is ok with you too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sbaggieboy60 Yep - but I've done that one myself a few times - I know the difference but auto correct changes it &amp; I don't notice! Honest guv! üëçüòâ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@beachMARGATE Fine, then I apologise - it was tagged as being last weekend! However - more recently I've seen some shocking messes in Margate, Ramsgate, Broadstairs &amp; in Canterbury &amp; Whitstable!

<|startoftext|>@ShaneoTheBaggie @phoenixbaggie @StephenWFLabour Absolutely - I think the cleanest place I've ever been is the Netherlands....unless any Dutch Twitter users want to tell me different?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@phoenixbaggie @StephenWFLabour Yes - I understand sometimes there is a serious overflow of rubbish round full bins that need emptying, but this seems to be just random leaving it where they sat! Totally irresponsible &amp; selfish!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamestaylor1 @phoenixbaggie @StephenWFLabour Fine, I understand that - I've never been there! However I've never seen anything as bad as this in most European countries I've visited, we are a messy nation - litter has always been a problem here! Btw, I suppose the mess in Dubai could have been caused by ex pat Brits? üòâüòÑ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@phoenixbaggie @StephenWFLabour Margate beach Monday morning after the weekend! The problem is those who create the mess who have no concern for anyone but themselves! Seems to be a "Brit" problem - don't seem to get it to same extent abroad!  https://t.co/0o56bBe0rE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@UncleSock @Hero_Taylor9 Absolutely Lee - that's the problem isn't it - one solution doesn't suit all pubs! One that focuses on food can book &amp; manage numbers - one that is a "boozer" that depends on being a local, needs casual trade as well as regulars!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent So a city takes part, it doesn't work out well, #coronavirusuk spikes, people get infected &amp; some consequently die! That's tough, but thanks anyway, you died in the interest of science! Yea, right! #eugenics #guineapigs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hero_Taylor9 Whoops "on holiday somewhere they DON'T know"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hero_Taylor9 Just considering the situation when people are on holiday somewhere they know - go for a day out &amp; pass a pub, think a pub lunch &amp; pint would be nice - can't cos not pre booked or registered! That "on spec - passing trade" is how some pubs survive! Going to be a can of worms!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PubsReopening is to be welcomed for both pubs &amp; customers!

<|startoftext|>@GoWhitstable @shopbythesea @TheShipWhit Yes - I agree. Poor that the indications all along were that it would be 2m &amp; now, so close to opening again,1m seems likely! Who'd own a business?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GoWhitstable I hope as #whitstable restaurants, cafes, pubs, etc. start to open up, you, or they, will keep us advised about arrangements for visiting them &amp; what they have in place for customer safety! Useful info for those of us who don't live local but feel the need to visit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Absolutely right - he promoted himself as a "fun" guy you could have a pint &amp; a fag with - everybody's best mate - so they gave him excessive air time access &amp; he just poisoned a lot of minds! Insidious, subliminal brainwashing by a very nasty man!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Yes I saw it earlier and retweeted it. I agree, Steve. It's a very pertinent &amp; telling thread! You can see from it how fascists spread their bile &amp; get into the minds of moderate people. It's how Hitler, Mussolini, Mosley &amp; other extremists grew their support!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matteous_ @spaceangel1964 Just about to say something similar myself!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@johnredwood Yep, frozen kangaroo meat is probably a better option than chlorinated chicken!  However, Aussies get tariff free access to a market of 67m &amp; we get it to a market of 25m but lose it to 450m in EU! That's progress?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@up_again Hancock, Raab &amp; a host of others currently in the cabinet were known to be incompetent even before they were appointed, but Johnson can only work with what he has &amp; he kicked the decent ones out over their opposition to his stance on Brexit! "As ye sow....." etc!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CrispinMount And compounded if we finish up without a deal with the EU! Double whammy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeanoTheBaggie Haha - that's commitment Dean ü§£üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies @LocalBaggiesFan @RyanPGlasgow Absolutely - my point yesterday! Got the ball forward wide, then didn't get it into box, played it into middle outside box &amp; tried to work it though  centre of Blues packed defence! It didn't work &amp; we didn't change it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyColclough @Jay89R @SteveMadeley78 I'd agree - especially with Fulham probably needing a win when they come to us - if it isn't all over by then!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeanoTheBaggie Was that after the game yesterday? ü§£ü§£ Seriously though - that's a really great picture! üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jay89R @SteveMadeley78 I'd take a draw at Brentford next week - especially if Fulham don't win at Leeds! Losing at Brentford would certainly increase the pressure on us &amp; I think they're a bigger threat than Fulham!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HannahPerkin Don't Look Now The Wicker Man Both from 70's but great films imho!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybill82 @WBADyl Didn't know the Chairman had been ill - I saw him interviewed on tv a few times when club were on the "up" &amp; he impressed me. Hope you stay up! Soft spot for club, got family in the town.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybill82 @WBADyl Yes strange - Huddersfield did really well to make the PL &amp; I thought, when they were relegated again, they'd made enough progress to build on it with the benefit of the parachute money. The failure to do so is surprising!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybill82 @WBADyl Agree - it needs a massive collapse in form by either us or Leeds not to go up now! 3/4 wins could be enough cos the others need 3 more wins than us to pass us! 6/7 wins out of 8 is huge task!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WBADyl A draw at Brentford next week would be a big point for us cos it drops them two &amp; stops them closing the gap at all! Think Fulham are away at Leeds too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies Yes - thought we were very narrow all game! We haven't scored in a league game since March now! üòÑ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ Yes - in fact we're further ahead of 3rd than we were this morning!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trying to go through the middle of a packed Blues defence isn't working &amp; we aren't using the overlap very well! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@m28246491 Absolutely right! It's why, years ago, the football authorities were so against live games on tv! It needs fans to createthe atmosphere &amp; they were worried tv would cause saturation &amp; fans would stay away!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daiseyrai Don't kid me....you'd nodded off!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noseybstard I'm happy enough for footie to be back - just finding this a bit sterile! I tried a few whiskies but it didn't help!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hero_Taylor9 Absolutely right Paul! Very odd! Good to see a game again, but don't want it like this for long!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, I'm only watching now cos its Baggies! Not finding the "experience" any better than the ManC game I gave up on after 40mins! Its like a pre-season friendly! Makes you realise how much fans add to a game! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenWFLabour @WBA Just trying to con my way in to see games live....lateral thinking! Better than watching games on tv, so getting bid in first! The üòÑüëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just wondering if I could offer the club my services as a temporary coach till the end of the season? I'm happy to sit in the dugout at next 8 games &amp; give my opinion &amp; advice! üòâ @WBA #wba<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NigelGilbert4 @MsCCollins1 @UKLabour Agree totally Nigel. I also find the actions of Saudi government appalling, but it doesn't make me anti Muslim! Never seen anyone ever suggest that connection! The propaganda by Israeli govt that criticism of them is racist is just clever political spin!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MsCCollins1 @UKLabour The reason I recently left the party is because of the brain dead inability to understand the difference between being anti-Jewish &amp; disliking the intensely racist Israeli government! I am a strong supporter of Judaism but don't like the politics of current Israeli government!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darrenthebaron1 @HairyAngus @DehennaDavison @BorisJohnson My tongue was firmly in my cheek whilst replying to a mate! It was in response to a Tory MP quoting the (advised by Central Office line) of "kinder, gentler" to any criticism from a supposed Labour member! However, I'm not a party member.

<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 Don't know? Is it Sky that adds it or do clubs play it over the PA? Good job Gould isn't still manager, with no crown noise they'd need to keep bleeping out him swearing at players! üòÅ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wezzaboing74 Agree - I haven't watched last 3 England games on tv. I think it's more the overkill of coverage rather than the quality of the football that stopped me bothering! When live football on tv was rare it was a treat to watch a game - normally now something is on nearly every day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@magneticsparrow Yes - I watched most of Man City game first half but soon got fed up &amp; switched it off! Normally at the start of a new season, which this is like after 3 months off, I'd binge a bit but really got no interest! Different today of course - just hope I find the experience better!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1983Jackhancock The Producers - or The 39 Steps, the version with Robert Donat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4 PL games on tv so far &amp; I haven't watched 3.5 of them! 40 minutes of the one I did see was enough - really didn't enjoy it! Have I changed after lockdown or was it the surreal experience of no crowd &amp; canned noise? Big test today with Baggies playing - hopefully better. #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoWhitstable @HairyAngus @WheelersOB @ChrisShdtch I went to an Indian wedding once &amp; the food they cooked themselves was absolutely awesome - nothing like you get in a restaurant!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoWhitstable @HairyAngus @WheelersOB @ChrisShdtch Great chefs the Chinese! Too many takeaways now serve rubbish but a really decent Chinese restaurant is a joy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @GoWhitstable @WheelersOB @ChrisShdtch The guy that owned my local Chinese restaurant was funniest guy I ever met - he owned it for years &amp; retired a couple of years ago! Miss him - it was a pleasureto go there....&amp; the food went down hill dreadfully when he went too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoWhitstable @HairyAngus @WheelersOB @ChrisShdtch You &amp; me both - a nice lobster would go down well now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @GoWhitstable @WheelersOB @ChrisShdtch Wow - tall for a Chinese.....!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @GoWhitstable @WheelersOB @ChrisShdtch I'll clean my pallet with something between courses - don't worry about me - I'm resilient &amp; indestructible!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GoWhitstable @HairyAngus @WheelersOB @ChrisShdtch I'm happy to try the outcome as an impartial judge! Problem is the round trip from Worcestershire to Whitstable to the east of Scotland will take some time! Build up a nice appetite though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @GoWhitstable @WheelersOB @ChrisShdtch Anglo-Scots relations takes a dive over fish soup! üòÅ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @GoWhitstable @WheelersOB Ah, mango chutney works wonders...I still have that mackerel with mango chutney on sourdough dish you mentioned some time ago - that's tasty!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoWhitstable @HairyAngus @WheelersOB Haven't had Whiting for years - a good chef would probably use the right mix of herbs &amp; spices but I don't know what they are. Agree it's a bland fish cooked simply though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoWhitstable @HairyAngus @WheelersOB Thanks - but it would be stinky by the time you'd mailed it to Worcestershire! However next time I'm down in Whitstable I'll let you know! I really like dabs too - so I'll get my order in early!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @GoWhitstable Bruges is lovely - compact &amp; friendly &amp; a foodie paradise - so is Ghent! Brussels is a bit run down but still has a lot to offer!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoWhitstable @HairyAngus @WheelersOB I agree - wild bass is wonderful &amp; much better than farmed! Used to go sea fishing with grandad of beach in Whitstable &amp; fresh fish we caught tasted so different! Wheelers fish/shellfish is wonderful - nowhere better imho - quirky isn't fair to judge their quality, but they are!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @GoWhitstable I actually like Belgium - the people (especially in the Flemish bit), the food &amp; the beer are all pretty decent, despite its reputation for being a bit "ordinary", it isn't! The rabbit they do is fabulous!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @GoWhitstable Stick to Flemish rabbit or chicken waterzooi in Belgium...or their wonderful mussels &amp; frites, is my advice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @GoWhitstable On Benbecula one of his regular jobs was to send in the daily weather report! He said he used to look out the window &amp; send in "its raining" or "it's foggy" - moving to Brum wrecked him - a week after he got there he threatened to knock his bosses teeth out if he didn't watch it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @GoWhitstable I was got into "smokies" when I worked with a guy from Arbroath who recommended them! He had worked on Benbecula previously for about 10 years - then he got promoted &amp; moved to Birmingham! He couldn't understand why he couldn't bring his border collie to work with him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @GoWhitstable I couldn't believe how good smoked eel was - I dislike jellies eels intensely, so the difference was a big surprise!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @GoWhitstable There was a fishmonger locally (gone now) who knew his business &amp; he used to get me Arbroath smokies from Birmingham wholesale fish market (which is awesome) - they were wonderful! He also got smoked eel from a guy on River Severn, which I loved. Not a fan of jellied eels though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @GoWhitstable Anything with any smoked fish is fine by me! I do a pasta dish with flaked smoked haddock &amp; cheese sauce, lots of black pepper! Wonderful for a winter's evening!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @GoWhitstable I wonder why that is? ü§î<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @GoWhitstable Yes the pea risotto is what she does but with bass fillets! I love it! I imagine it would be great with smoked salmon too.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GoWhitstable @HairyAngus No, you've got my name correct! Just referring to her by Mrs &amp; my first name initial - bit more personal than Mrs Martin! Could use her real first name but don't think its fair to really when she isn't tagged into conversation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @GoWhitstable Looks delicious - mind you, MrsH does a pretty mean fish risotto which is really superb - so I can't complain!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Oh I love her....Janey that is....not the FM!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @GoWhitstable You really do know how to rub it in don't you! ü§£ü§£ Keep telling me about your fish meals....I adore monkfish! Stay safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoWhitstable @HairyAngus Lol - yes but I meant a "safe bet" to eat the food, not a "safe bet" to avoid the plague...only time will tell if that comes with a visit! Ambiguous phrasing by me...must do better!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GoWhitstable @m28246491 @ProvanTony @thompsonjjd @Johndal62967863 @OldNeptune @DukesWhitstable @Kiminthebubble @ChrisShdtch Got much from my grandmother whose family (Beer) have been in town since 1700's.

<|startoftext|>@m28246491 @GoWhitstable @ProvanTony @thompsonjjd @Johndal62967863 @OldNeptune @DukesWhitstable @Kiminthebubble @ChrisShdtch Yes - some of the restaurants with limited covers must be getting really worried! If you rely on filling about 20  tables every night in summer, possibility of only using, say, 6 won't be sustainable! I'm same as you, wondering when I'll get there again! Usually there June/July!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@m28246491 @GoWhitstable @ProvanTony @thompsonjjd @Johndal62967863 @OldNeptune @DukesWhitstable @Kiminthebubble @ChrisShdtch I looked it up - offered at ¬£690k which isn't bad for a property there! I'm sure there'll be lots of "homes to let" properties in Whitstable that could be in trouble at the moment - I know one in Nelson Rd where owner only lives there for 9 months &amp; lets in summer to afford it!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@m28246491 @GoWhitstable @ProvanTony @thompsonjjd @Johndal62967863 @OldNeptune @DukesWhitstable @Kiminthebubble @ChrisShdtch Yes tremendous - huge connection with the Whitstable salvage divers! The Guinea &amp; Dollar Row were built with money salvaged from wrecks by local divers &amp; I think Copland House has strong connections too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoWhitstable @m28246491 @ProvanTony @thompsonjjd @Johndal62967863 @OldNeptune @DukesWhitstable @Kiminthebubble @ChrisShdtch Could well be - I saw somewhere she died in a home in Whitstable a few years ago well into her 90's! There was a small back bar at the Guinea called the Cabin, down steps from main pub! Florence was always announced coming down steps into it by the jangle of her jewellery! üòÅ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@m28246491 @GoWhitstable @ProvanTony @thompsonjjd @Johndal62967863 @OldNeptune @DukesWhitstable @Kiminthebubble @ChrisShdtch I loved the Guinea - had a wonderful landlady for years called Florence, always immaculately dressed. The others have been closed a long time. An ancestor of mine, Edward Carden, ran the Fisherman's Arms &amp; had the "Favourite" built in the late 19th century! #whitstable #heritage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoWhitstable @ProvanTony @thompsonjjd @Johndal62967863 @OldNeptune @DukesWhitstable @Kiminthebubble @ChrisShdtch Yes, great times - and generally it was "fun", seldom any trouble &amp; we all respected each other! Whitstable had very few residents then who weren't from "Whitstable" families - hence the strong feeling of one community.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoWhitstable @ProvanTony @thompsonjjd @Johndal62967863 @OldNeptune @DukesWhitstable @Kiminthebubble @ChrisShdtch I'm fortunate to remember some of the pubs that have gone &amp; many of the real characters, both landlords &amp; regulars, who were around in the late 60's &amp; early 70's! Some real community pubs then, still a few in town but too many now are for the tourists!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GoWhitstable @ProvanTony @thompsonjjd @Johndal62967863 @OldNeptune @DukesWhitstable @Kiminthebubble @ChrisShdtch You &amp; me both....I need to write a book about my pub memories of Whitstable.....but I fear it might be banned! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daiseyrai Would you! This is desperate - I managed 35 minutes of that &amp; turned it off! Have to say I hated it but watching the Baggies might be better &amp; a friendly voice might help! üòâü§£üëç<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SachiKnight There used to be an excellent bookshop in an indoor market arcade in Bridgenorth, but last time I went there, sadly, it had gone! I haven't been there for 3/4 years so don't what is there now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SachiKnight I did a post grad course in counselling about 20 years ago &amp; my tutor lived in Shropshire &amp; owned a bookshop in Shrewsbury - it was one of several I used to visit there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SachiKnight Lovely - I've still got books that I had when I was young but sadly forgot to move some with me in a house move years ago! Btw - "The Mind" is an Oxford anthology so it doesn't have an author but was edited by Richard Gregory<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SachiKnight I'm a hoarder too - but I love second hand book shops and buy anything a bit quirky that interests me! Also specifically collect anything on Pre-Raphaelites &amp; my home county of Kent! So plenty of options to buy out there! Just love real books!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BRUMMIEROADER Certainly, but a German company supplying the German government &amp; army of the day would hardly have been considered wrong at the time.

<|startoftext|>@PeterBone1 @Grippo77 I agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterBone1 @Grippo77 Of course not, but the point is those who go over the top destroy the good intentions of the peaceful protestors! The media highlight the violence &amp; that's what people remember cos that's the "news!" Hence the real issue is marginalised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eveshambaggy Exactly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterBone1 @Grippo77 You've missed my point - I probably didn't explain it as well as I should but constrained by twitter! The point was violence, by however few,  becomes the story, not the issue about what the protest is for! So the violence is what becomes the news &amp; the issue is marginalised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whether left or right, once protest descends into violence you've lost your right to be heard because the violence becomes the story, not the issue of protest! #Riot2020 #BritainFirst #Violence #BlackLivesMatterUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie Good to hear - enjoy your day Chris.üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Richbaggies Hence my suggestion 15 points is enough  - I actually think less points will be enough, but 5 wins should make sure!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett Yes I think if you perm the combination of fixtures, dog eat dog will sort a lot of issue out, irrespective of what we do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Martw90 Anyone hoping to catch us will really have to go some!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 Exactly  - anything is possible! Hit the floor running next week would be good!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislepkowski Exactly my point Chris - we only need an average run in really &amp; a draw at Brentford &amp; don't lose at home to Fulham with 3/4 other wins will do it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Albion2All @DavidKe30081373 That's my point &amp; why 12/15 pts is all we need - no one else is really close enough to catch us unless we blow up completely!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lazydave68 Exactly.....but who'd be a real Baggie without the nagging doubt! üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShaneoTheBaggie Yes....its that "but" that sticks in my mind!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidBaker70 Yes that thought had crossed my mind.....üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Realistically, 15 more points will almost certainly guarantee us promotion. If so, Fulham would need 22pts from 9 games to finish above us, which is unlikely. 12+ pts for us will probably do it! Need a massive fade out to fail now! But... this is the Baggies......! ü§¢ #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe in 200 years, society today will be held in the same contempt for its shortcomings as we currently hold slave traders of 18/19th centuries! Hindsight is a wonderful tools to judge those who went before with! If we'd truly progressed #BlackLivesMatter  wouldn't be an issue!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpeedell Quite - &amp; probably compounded to epic &amp; destructive proportions if we end up with "no deal" with Brexit! The worry for me would be serious civil disobedience....or, should I say, riots!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pcmac41 @TheVan @bfatchett Yes - we never did very well there! Decent keeper Royce. Didn't Super Bob get sent off there once?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pcmac41 @TheVan @bfatchett Yes I went to that - stayed the night in hotel &amp; went for a walk to the end of that bloody pier &amp; back next day! Took most of the day to do it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVan @bfatchett Quite  - but we won a game or two &amp; certainly helped a lot of local economies!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVan @bfatchett Agree. PL grounds are so sterile. I loved many of the trips in the old 3rd Division those couple of seasons - Darlington, Mansfield, Chester Exeter, Torquay etc when we almost took the grounds over!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Quite &amp; the sea food helps, big time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVan @bfatchett Funny how some away days are so enjoyable &amp; others can be the pits, isn't it! I have certain grounds I love going to &amp; others I hate! My all time "hate" is that awful London Stadium! A modern dump &amp; awful to get to imho! Loved Upton Park though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hero_Taylor9 Yes, I felt quite excited when they announced the Blues game was live on Sky! As you say, Paul, fingers crossed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett Yes I really enjoyed my trip there last season! Found their fans really friendly too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hero_Taylor9 Yes - I agree! Just need Baggies to get the job done now! Seems a long time since last game at Swansea!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hero_Taylor9 Agree - glad its sorted! Would have been such a shame if season had been voided &amp; they'd both missed out! Never any guarantee they'd have repeated it next season &amp; they now have a decent length of time to prepare for the higher level.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually quite pleased for Coventry &amp; Rotherham! Coventry's decline from PL was disastrous &amp; swift &amp; they've done well to stop it &amp; get back to Championship. Rotherham didn't seem a bad side when they went down &amp; I've got a soft spot for them anyway! #efl #promotion #rufc  #CCFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus I love being by/near the sea but I haven't sat on a beach with 100's of others since I was made to when I was a kid! Hated it! Empty, unspoilt beaches are an enjoyable escape but crowds at Brighton, Blackpool, Margate etc on a summer weekend, I avoid!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus It isn't really a "visit to the seaside" for me though! I never visit the seaside in the true sense! It's returning to my home town for which I have a strong love &amp; miss when I'm not there! It just happens to be by the sea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I don't visit #whitstable in June, July or August this year, it will only be the second time in my life that I haven't spent at least some time there in summer since I was born! Sad times! Summer days in the town are special!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @DavidKe30081373 I've seen someone local using one for his business - goes to clients in it occasionally instead of his usual van - he's a painter/decorator - generally it does him no harm, just causes amusement!

<|startoftext|>@DavidKe30081373 Yes. The whole programme, from 1960, was Wisdom on his own or with Forsyth! Such talent they both had! Never realised Wisdom could play a host of musical instruments!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidKe30081373 Yes - wonderful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brynbaggie Yes - I'd say US is probably closer to civil war than it has ever been. Trump needs to tread carefully, but I don't think he knows how.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@brynbaggie I've seen most of the documentaries  - haven't read Max Hastings book - should do. I was just getting an interest in "world" events at the time it was happening - my "hippie" years - it touched me greatly at the time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brynbaggie Very true!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brynbaggie Yes, they dug a huge hole for themselves &amp; then dug a bit deeper! It became an "ego" thing for Nixon &amp; it was ordinary families in US who suffered! And ultimately, they left with their tails between their legs &amp; victory for the North.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brynbaggie Yes it was a horrible war! The atrocities on both sides were unspeakable!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brynbaggie Yes, the effect there was immense - so many deaths of young soldiers sent to fight touched 1000's of US families. Eventually it was the mass protests that influenced politicians  &amp; lead to the war ending!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billericaybaggy I fear for civilisation quite frankly Ian! The way we are going, there will be   destruction of society if we continue on the current road!

<|startoftext|>@Balr0g @RFC477 @HairyAngus @GraanyJanni I believe it's called "Great" Britain because the island to which it refers is the largest in the British Isles! It's a geographical description of a land mass, not a political union!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DeanoTheBaggie @WbaFormer @Thompson1Garry That spell we had him and Cyrille together was impressive &amp; they weren't together long enough imho! Both going &amp; being replaced by Crooks &amp; Varadi was the start of the shocking decline!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Yes - I see a second wave happening &amp; being worse than last time!

<|startoftext|>@matthews_boing It isn't inconsistent at all - my point was you don't need direct contact with someone to see their qualities!

<|startoftext|>@baggieant64 Normally it might include him but he wasn't at this meeting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 Agree totally. Having that sort of interrogation by video link really doesn't work does it. Johnson is toast if Cummings goes &amp; he knows it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaCraik64 "I'm using all the right words...but not necessarily in the right order....!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaCraik64 Yes I agree - but being a clever bloke &amp; being good at politics or dealing with the media don't always go together<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie Agree - sadly though, this video link type of session is never going to work very well. In a Select Committee they'd have a pre meeting &amp;  agree to divvy up the questions before hand so to avoid duplication - difficult to do that effectively by laptop!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noseybstard Yep! I might join him.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wbachris_ Exactly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wbachris_ Cummings is a very clever man, he's certainly the "power &amp; brains" in government at the moment. I agree, he's not a member of any political party, but he's very important to Johnson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noseybstard I used to think it was a bit of an act but eventually the mask would slip &amp; he'd suddenly become tough, articulate &amp; very confident but, sadly, this is as good as it gets!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wbachris_ Don't disagree. That's why Tories picked him! They knew he could win an election on personality, when May nearly lost 2 years earlier! Figurehead, then keep him out of limelight with a strong back up team. Starts to explain Cummings importance! Who's the daddy, so to speak! üòâüòÅ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noseybstard Yes - I'm speechless! Inept in the extreme!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sbaggieboy60 Well of course - breach of contract...gross misconduct! No defence....obviously happy to go!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wbachris_ That's the problem of election system really isn't it! Used to be about "what" was on offer, now it's really become an election based on personalities - almost presidential. Open mind on Starmer yet - quite like his "softly, softly" approach but waiting to see him really tested!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that enough of that....#Pointless will be on in a few minutes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sbaggieboy60 Quite - whoever did that had guts! Remarkable really! If they don't get caught it will be a miracle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wbachris_ Actually the opposition got more votes than the elections lost by Brown &amp; Miliband, but they lost seats they'd normally win because of EU issue! I didn't just blame the medi. However its semantics! Fact is, with this idiot running it, the UK is right up shit street.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sbaggieboy60 Not me - but whoever did deserves a knighthood! üòÅüòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wbachris_ Not when the opposition was subjected to 4 years of hatchet job by most of the media! Most people vote on single issues &amp; "get Brexit done" was the only thing that too many cared about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noseybstard People often refer to "car crash" interviews ...we're watching one now... but you expect better from the PM! Frightening!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Over many years as a civil servant &amp; then as an elected councillor, I've worked with many senior politicians of all political persuasions &amp; found them mostly to be intelligent, capable  articulate people! #Johnson isn't in the same class, he's a bumbling, incompetent, buffoon!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StephenMangan #Cummings has made his statement - press have scrutinised it - public can make up their own minds what they think!

<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 @Lorrainesleato1 @kevinpbreslin That's my point Steve! The press aren't there to be nice to anyone! They sell papers though controversial stories &amp; "ain't it awful" shit stirring! Set a ball rolling &amp; give it a push! Cummings has been treated no better/worse than 1000's more over many years!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lorrainesleato1 @stevebaggie1 @kevinpbreslin He set himself up to be questioned when he called a press conference! (Which, by the way, is unprecedented) - the press would have questioned anyone that way! Scrutiny! What is appalling is the way they camp outside his house. That is contemptible &amp; an invasion of privacy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 @Lorrainesleato1 @kevinpbreslin #scumedia witch hunts were directed at Labour &amp; Corbyn for 5 years! Presumably that was ok for you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 @kevinpbreslin He should practice what he preaches - he didn't! He put his own instincts before the wellbeing of the wider community! In my book anyone who tries to justify his selfish actions is as bad as he is!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WarmongerHodges Fact is Cummings was acting totally in self interest &amp; was morally bankrupt! Whether his actions were "legal" or not is a deflection from the issue of his responsibility to the wider community - which millions have honoured, often at great personal cost! Gove is complicit!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SimonClarkeMP The government guidelines were quite clear - his wife displayed symptoms &amp; needed to isolate at home for 7 days &amp; since he'd been in contact with her, he needed to isolate at home for 14 days! Isn't that correct? He didn't -or was that open to interpretation &amp; "common sense" too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VickyNewham Quite - easy really - unless the person in question is arrogant, opinionated &amp; believes their position makes them entitled to act selfishly &amp; with no concern for the wide community!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarristerSecret @Cornish_Damo Also since she was self isolating with symptoms, wasn't he supposed to also for 14 days? But he didn't.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cabinetofficeuk So an "unauthorised" tweet elicited more concern from the Cabinet Office than the hired help driving 260 miles with family members, breaking lockdown, when he should have been isolating in quarantine with Covid symptoms?

<|startoftext|>@jezzeralexander I think now Steve Baker has broken ranks &amp; called for him to go, the writing is probably on the wall! The damage limitation with all the "big guns" defending him yesterday clearly didn't work - ultimately it will be "party first" as it always is!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If a young child is "vulnerable" because his parents have Covid symptoms, how does it not add to that vulnerability for those parents to drive 250 miles? Perhaps "irresponsiblity by parents" needs adding to "vulnerability" in those circumstances! #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislepkowski @WifiMarxist @richbaggie @baggiedave70 Exactly the point!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 Yes but I'm referring specifically to BBC News which is full of people who were active in Tory Party at uni! Even head of news is an ex party media person!

<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 Big trouble with track &amp; trace is, it requires you to notify when you show symptoms but you can be infectious several days before symptoms show, by when you could have infected dozens of others!

<|startoftext|>@AntWBA434 Yea I'd go with that....!üòÅüòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AntWBA434 Exactly my point about 12000 in a 40000 stadium!

<|startoftext|>Difficult to see when we'll get sport with crowds again?

<|startoftext|>@bfatchett @DazHaleWM People only heard the conflicting messages he put out yesterday! That set the tone - the qualifications today are too late once people have an opinion! The headline sells it - that was yesterday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DazHaleWM The strategy of a gradual relaxation of lockdown is sound enough but it is starting too soon! The level of daily infection is still too high not to risk s severe second spike! Scotland/Wales/NI still recognise this! The risk Johnson is taking now is too dangerous a one inho<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus I think Cummings simply is Johnson's man &amp; other senior Tories don't like his power!

<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Well he certainly didn't write it himself! I get the feeling he's being set up to be the fall guy when it all goes pear shaped the way some Ministers have given out different messages today! He's now dispensable!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StigsWBACousin Nudge nudge wink wink say no more!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If "officials" can come up with a detailed, 50 page doc about Gov strategy on plan to exit lockdown, its reasonable to expect them to produce an intelligible 10 min speech for PM yesterday!

<|startoftext|>@alansmoore There were plenty who hailed Chamberlain when he proclaimed "peace in our time" - it was with hindsight that people saw appeasement was flawed! This relaxation of lockdown at this time is flawed - that's why I draw the comparison.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonJonesSnr @TGFMichaelRosen When Johnson read a prepared speech, from auto cue, to recording, that could be edited, or re-recorded, its remarkable that it was still confused, ambiguous &amp; full of contradictions!

<|startoftext|>@martincroom Can't believe Johnson said a few days before a Bank Holiday/VE Day commemorations, that he'd make an announcement "after the weekend" about amendments to lockdown! Once he said that what message did it give? Either he's brain dead, or it was intentional for the effect it had!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MartinShovel Quite! It really does have to be some sort of brain dead to announce a week before a Bank Holiday that on the Sunday after the holiday he might bring in some easing of #lockdown!

<|startoftext|>@MarkOknee @mark_rollason I thought that was always the implied bottom line from what Johnson originally said about "taking it on the chin" &amp; "many families will lose loved ones before their time!" But I take your point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett @mark_rollason No, I think they were built for the purpose they said they were, which was to take the expected higher number of cases than existing hospitals could handle. They had planned for 500 patients at London now but never got above 30 (apparently). Brum should have been open 2 weeks ago<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leeirv14 @mark_rollason Yes I agree. I think one of the problems they started to encounter in London was it didn't have most of the back up services on sight that are needed for effective critical care to make recovery more likely. B'ham was planned more for recovering patients &amp; also palliative care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie Yes, I trust its stats a lot more than all the media hype we get! The steady decline in perceived cases is very encouraging.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mark_rollason I don't think any of the emergency hospitals they built has been needed have they?

<|startoftext|>@Warren_Stephens Agree - I think if we do play the last 9 games 12/14 pts would probably see us promoted - Fulham, or others, unlikely to win 6/7+ of remaining games! And we play Fulham too! The point was really it will be like a new season so form a bit of an unknown!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ONONERON Well I never mentioned "normality" - I  just said "some positive signs" &amp; "limited return" - of course no fans isn't normal but I doubt well see that this side of Christmas - so football on tv will be better than nothing!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AntWBA434 Yep - be the most typically Albion thing ever wouldn't it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad that there seems to be some positive signs that a limited return to football does seem to be likely.

<|startoftext|>@dailowe @andy_hazzard1 @Zedy78Zedy @nazirafzal Exactly - a presumption herd immunity would offer a solution was not based on scientific research/opinion but a willingness to let it rip swiftly through the community at a high cost in deaths but a lower cost to the economy than lockdown!

<|startoftext|>@andy_hazzard1 @dailowe @Zedy78Zedy @nazirafzal Worrying too that when the media do mention it they skip over it almost dismissively! You're right, it is a massively important point!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dailowe @andy_hazzard1 @Zedy78Zedy @nazirafzal Herd immunity was based on a premise that if we all got infected &amp; recovered, the virus would disappear.

<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus An aside, few years ago we were guests of Husum, town in north Germany a few miles from Danish border. Local delicacy is brown shrimp, they do all sorts with it! They catch it, fly it to North Africa to be shelled, fly it back &amp; it's still affordable! UK can't compete with that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus An observation that could be leveled at many!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Absolutely - I don't think most of the commonwealth currently has a shortage of fish that needs filling by shipping it halfway round the world! Australia? New Zealand? Canada? All well supplied at home! Most other commonwealth countries couldn't afford British fish!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Quite - I believe much of the fish landed at UK ports goes abroad &amp; the internal UK market for fish isn't going to grow enough to soak up loss of sales to EU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lazydave68 It certainly hasn't bothered me that much yet but I'm too busy trying to keep myself safe! I'm like you, not out that much in normal times anyway except for sport, but I'll need to be very convinced the risk is minimal before I'll get in a big crowd again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus People fail to realise it was never just about protecting British waters for British fishers but British fishing also retaining access to EU fishing grounds to their benefit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Quite - my home town has a fishing industry - mainly shellfish - they voted leave, then the reality sunk in! When Farage visited, some time later, in expectation of a warm welcome, they nearly lynched him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Absolutely right! The promotion of Brexit was always about making it better for the 1% &amp; the plebs suck it up - just like they sucked up the Johnson mantra at last GE! Living to regret it...or not living much longer in some cases!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Same down here - so many farmers were pro Brexit &amp; now they are grasping the reality they are crying foul!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@histevegray He also made sure we didn't join the Euro - superb judgement imho - it was always potentially going to be fraught with problems &amp; most of cabinet, including TB, were in favour of joining. Remarkable that he won that debate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray Yes PFI was a poor decision in my opinion - totally wrong for a Labour government to even contemplate &amp; so many hospital trusts suffered terribly as a result!

<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie I feel for, that must be really hard! NHS sent me a letter 2 weeks ago &amp; said I'd got to do that too but I didn't have any of the conditions on the list!

<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @ksshuttle Did a media course once - advice was, get message in headline &amp; first paragraph, cos anything after that won't be read by 90% - read many articles &amp; the actual story, after first paragraph, paints a totally different picture to what you first see!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KMCTenor It isn't what it was when Clive Joyce was editor! Cub reporters that change every 5 minutes &amp; little understanding of the local community! They stopped giving me a free copy so I don't buy it!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @LesleyRiddoch It's the successful "soft" socialism of lots of countries that do well that those who decry it ignore! They only highlight the failures! All political models are only as good as those why apply them - the Scandinavian countries &amp; others seem to get it right!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Worth noting - that's out of a county population of 600,000! That's 0.14% of the population! Rationalise your figures please - don't just quote a figure &amp; say it "reaches!" @ksshuttle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Yes I saw that - excellent policy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also... the current closure, whilst understandable, is by direction of government, so all businesses currently closed should be compensated by government! Their potential failure, during shut down, isn't down to bad management or poor business model, it's down to govt decision!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Quite - it's always those with the money already who make more from misfortune! And I get asked why I'd never vote Tory! Nye Bevan gave the best description of them....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 @AdamHingley @HairyAngus Tory spin coming out there? Magic money tree? The magic money tree has come up trumps when it suits the Tories with ¬£100bn+ for HS2 - most of which is going to foreign companies! Labour had costed their manifesto over a several year programme &amp; the money went back into UK economy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 @HairyAngus @AdamHingley Less! Much less! It was ¬£1200bn when  Blair became PM - that was what Labour inherited from the Thatcher/Major years - it was ¬£800bn when Labour left government, even after the world banking crisis in 2008! They reduced the Tory debt by 50%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 @AdamHingley @HairyAngus Austerity wasn't needed - it was a political choice, not an economic need! All it did was triple the national debt &amp; it led to the privatisation of billions of pounds worth of state assets! Appalling financial mismanagement!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamHingley @stevebaggie1 @HairyAngus Absolutely right - even the head of the Bank of England admitted that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 @AdamHingley @HairyAngus But we've  had10 years of Tory economic policy &amp; nation debt has risen from ¬£800bn to ¬£2tn! They borrowed more in10 years than every other government has since the Napoleonic wars! Sold off great swathes of NHS to profit seekers like Virgin &amp; Serco &amp; gave us 10 years of austerity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 @HairyAngus How long have you got! However to start, I believe in Keynesian economics policies - Tories basically reject it - market rules! That drives much of how govt operate! Also I believe that govt key role is people first - look after the sick, old, poor! Tories priority is the economy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @stevebaggie1 My ideology &amp; theirs don't really overlap on anything - so the option of voting for them is never a consideration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 @HairyAngus No because I don't believe in their philosophy on the role of government or society on virtually anything! I've worked in both District &amp; County Councils &amp; agreed with Tory councillors on many things but I don't want them in govt! I have voted Lab, Green, LibDem &amp; independent tho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @stevebaggie1 I'm totally unique Steve! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 @HairyAngus Millions do! My grandparents both voted Tory all their lives, their son, my dad, only voted Labour! I'm a socialist but I didn't vote Labour between 1996 &amp; 2010 &amp; I spent those years as in independent councillor &amp; parliamentary agent for an independent MP. My vote needs earning!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Exactly my point about Blair &amp; Starmer! Corbyn &amp; most of his cabinet weren't acceptable to the "establishment" so they had to be got rid of! They couldn't be bought off! Hence the media &amp; forces inside Labour made sure they failed! The Tories didn't have to do a lot to win!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Scots are basically left of centre by default in my experience. English are more prone to be right wing - a massive generalisation I know, but it shows itself to be true time &amp; again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus But I think there is a "nationalist" streak in Scots DNA that helps them put Scotland above everything else. And it's only the "floaters" in England who are swung! Labour still polled more votes in December than they did under Brown or Miliband defeats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus The power of the press was shown when Murdoch's empire &amp; others dumped Major &amp; said vote Blair! People lap up what the Mail, Sun, Telegraph...&amp; the BBC.... tell them! The media set the agenda &amp; filter what people are told! It wins elections.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus England won't vote socialist all the time the press/media drive the thinking by telling people that option is bad! The media destroyed Corbyn with fake news (now slowly coming out) because the "establishment" were terrified that a socialist government would be elected!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Well Scotland never had anything but Blairite Labour, now England has it back too! Starmer has lost me very quickly! Totally establishment!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus It's how they operate - they get a sound bite &amp; work it to death! Focus on one thing or one person &amp; get it into people's heads! They understand that a huge number of voters have the perception &amp; attention span of an 8 yo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scan1968 It's no fun at the moment is it! I feel trapped too at times. I just take the view it's only "now" and every day is a day nearer getting back to normal!

<|startoftext|>@a_manofkent @80_mcswan @jbwhitesnake My comment was about the election of Johnson as Tory party leader &amp; the rationale for it, it wasn't referring to the GE result.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Too many in England vote on "personalities" or "single issues!" The number of people who took the view "Boris is fun" without realising that was what the spin the handful of powerful people who run the Tories promoted to win GE - but they still get Tory when BJ is dumped!

<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus They've been doing that already - saying they were "acting on latest scientific advice" was reason given for delay in lockdown! They picked the opinion that said no need when wider opinion world wide said it was essential!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@80_mcswan @jbwhitesnake Sadly the Tories only elected Johnson party leader because they thought he was "liked" enough by the wider electorate to win a GE after the 2017 "near miss!"

<|startoftext|>@chrislepkowski @martincroom @jemclay @corinnebailey What a relief then, that NHS is still basically government responsibility otherwise, if it was privatised to, say, US health care providers, government would be saying provision of PPE to hospitals wasn't their responsibility!

<|startoftext|>@ronstanding @johnmcdonnellMP My wife is a nurse &amp; I asked her the same question this morning.

<|startoftext|>@daiseyrai Forgive me for asking...but how do you "wear out" a mug? I think you were just bored and decided you needed to do something? I fill the current void searching out different malt whisky on line....now that's really rewarding! üòâüëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislepkowski @TheVan @DickLaurent96 Excellent newspaper all round Chris<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie Yes I'm sure you're right!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislepkowski @TheVan @DickLaurent96 The NY Times  Rory Smith?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DickLaurent96 @TheVan Yes agree, I can't see it being voided.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daiseyrai @TerryKMartin Just a bog standard disappointment......!üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVan @DickLaurent96 Thanks. I'd still be of the view if new season has to start first week in September it'll be behind closed doors. My concern would be for Championship, L1 &amp; 2 clubs who won't have Sky income to offset loss of income.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVan @DickLaurent96 Haven't seen the news, what's prompted that observation?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Depressing stuff! Negligence &amp; procrastination by government has made this worse than it need have been! #Covid19UK  https://t.co/oHFEJQ3Z6s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baggiestex Quite! Frightening isn't it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoodWBA Second wave is a real danger! Come out off lockdown too soon &amp; get complacent &amp; it'll all flair up again! Scary &amp; deadly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoodWBA I'm doing my best! You stay safe too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoodWBA Quite - I don't think a lot of people have really got their heads round this yet! It isn't going to suddenly disappear &amp; it will come back if we aren't careful! Hopefully we will have vaccine sooner rather than later!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@griffraces Are they? I hadn't seen that! I think next season will be shorter than normal but I presume this season will probably be completed to empty stadiums.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't see fans returning to football games until about Christmas! Hope I'm wrong, but think the last thing government release restrictions on will be sports crowds! #SocialDistanacing will be in place for months yet where sport is concerned!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyeCity_ You aren't! Desperately disappointed  with him so far!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lockdown is wearing but necessary! Tonight, if I could have my choice, it would be a meal at @Samphirewhit but I'll have to wait a bit yet - sadly! #whitstable<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chrisjdownes Well done! üëç Stay safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've kept quiet so far...but one observation...if there were Labour MP's &amp; HQ staff who weren't 100% committed to delivering a Labour government in 2017 &amp; 2019 they have no right to remain in the party, because, twice, they have enabled a Tory government! #LabourWreckersDossier<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This lockdown brings home how many of the simple things we regularly do &amp; take for granted are actually the important things in our lives! The sooner those days return, the better! But #StayHome until #WhenCoronaVirusIsOver<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sorry to see Sterling Moss has died! The first truly iconic sportsman I remember in my childhood, a true household name &amp; undoubtedly the greatest driver never to be World Champion! #RIPSterlingMoss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OliverHoliday Yes I think mid July is about right! Emphasis then has to be on county competition not artificial franchise cricket! Then we need a dry summer so Worcs isn't flooded again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OliverHoliday Quite - exactly the point. The success, or otherwise, of the hundred will be hard to judge currently but the Blast is a huge earner for counties! Although I imagine TV will be a strong voice for the hundred since they're putting a lot of money in!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you know what - I'm really not interested in a blow by blow account of what happened to Johnson as the lead issue on #marr! I'd rather be hearing about stopping more deaths &amp; protecting front line #NHSheroes as the priority!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martincroom @PeterBone1 No point risking a quick single if you are trying to keep strike..... üòâüëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 @PeterBone1 @martincroom Mid 60's to early 70's was a golden era for Kent! Was a season or 2 they had 13 current test players in the squad - before restrictions on overseas players!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterBone1 @martincroom Saw them all play, live! I suppose the players of our youth hold the memories longer because we tend to have "heroes" when we're young, but the top players today don't seem quite so "special" to me as they all did!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kgardner081 Apparently the cricket authorities were aiming at a different audience when they came up with the format! High risk if it doesn't attract new people since I may alienate its existing fan base! We'll see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kgardner081 You are probably right but the 100 does nothing for the County game since it is played at fewer venues! I support a County &amp; franchise teams, playing a new format, is of no interest to me - I'm sure plenty of others feel the same<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martincroom @PeterBone1 Yes absolutely right - earliest game I can remember was when I was 7/8 at Canterbury with my dad, in Festival week! Cowdrey &amp; Evans were in Kent team that day! Two all time greats!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterBone1 @martincroom By the way....hope "of a certain vintage" doesn't imply I ever saw WG  Grace at the wicket! I didn't! üòÇüòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterBone1 @martincroom Thanks - I'll check it out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know #cricket  probably isn't much on anyone's minds at present but it was due to start about now - so wouldn't it be a good move to cancel the pointless, franchised #cricket100 tournament &amp; reschedule traditional county &amp; one day games to maximise income for hard hit Counties!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @brimfieldben @MattHancock Mind you - I'd have to move up there to ensure supply!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @brimfieldben @MattHancock Haggis, neeps &amp; tatties! I'd be ok with that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @brimfieldben @MattHancock Yep - and the big worry will be when the supply chain starts to be affected, which is inevitable the longer this goes on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @brimfieldben @MattHancock Absolutely - too many think if we get through the first few weeks, its sorted! This will be with us 2/3 times until a vaccine is available! Currently there seems to be no consensus that even having it produces immunity!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cllrfranoborski Yes that's where it was. Must be over 20 years now since it closed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cllrfranoborski Fran - I'm trying to remember the name of that "supermarket" that used to be halfway along Lorne St? Closed after he was unfortunately killed on holiday in Spain. Was it Clark's? Can you remember?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WestBromEL Sounds like a moving experience....! üòâüëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @brimfieldben @MattHancock Quite - the frightening thing is we are  only about halfway through this &amp; already some are suggesting stopping the lockdown! The economy comes before lives for some!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jemclay Quite! I like a bit of a whinge about trivial stuff.....but can't be bothered at the moment! Perspective!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brimfieldben @MattHancock Its how I feel too Ben - I don't think we are being told anything near the truth!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brimfieldben @MattHancock Quite Ben! Although not only is it disgusting, its incompetence &amp; criminal!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jemclay Quite Jem! Yes all good here - so far! Being ultra cautious! Hope all ok with you too? Stay safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@griffraces @AnthonySteedman Quite - herd immunity is still the government line in this, despite what they say, so "management of death" is the strategy! Hence the "success" they get is keeping their mates safe!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perhaps the "precious resource" those needing to wear #PPE are the people in hospital they are trying to save &amp; those who are trying to do it? @MattHancock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jemclay This should have been put in place, as a contingency, when this started in China - it was predicted then it would become a world wide pandemic! Complacency costs lives &amp; procrastination compounds it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martincroom Johnson &amp; Trump &amp; like tweedledum  &amp; tweedledee the way they parrot the same garbage! Its little surprise that their similar approach to this virus look like making UK &amp; US hardest hit for deaths!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martincroom Absolutely right Martin - the stupidity arrogance &amp; complacency of government, particularly Johnson ("I've been shakin hands with everybody"), in those early days, when earlier action could have had significant inpact, is criminally negligent!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glenharveyjones @campbellclaret @HilaryBurrage @MattHancock @BorisJohnson "On the third day he rose again....!" How apt its Easter!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@campbellclaret @MattHancock She doesn't need families permission to give numbers if she doesn't give names, there is no breach of confidentiality - so the inference to be drawn is that the figures are pretty depressing &amp; government have made a decision to withhold them!

<|startoftext|>@matthebaker1 @BorisJohnson However I'm sure neither of us are enjoying what is happening so we'll just have to agree to disagree? Stay safe mate - hopefully it ends before too long!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthebaker1 @BorisJohnson If Johnson had acted earlier, as he was advised to by WHO, probably 1000's more lives may have been saved! A lockdown will save lives! A letter 2 weeks after the lockdown started won't save lives! Like millions of people I don't think government are doing very well at all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @billericaybaggy @BorisJohnson Rees Mogg said it had to be sent to you by stagecoach to Edinburgh, then onward by pack horse! Trouble is, Dick Turpin intercepted it at York!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gemmabaggies @BorisJohnson Twice as popular as me then! üòÇüòâüëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billericaybaggy @BorisJohnson Exactly - getting a letter this long after it was written is ridiculous, particularly after the constant daily reminders on tv &amp; in the media generally! It's a pointless public relations exercise &amp; a total waste of post office time when they're already under pressure!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthebaker1 @BorisJohnson Sorry, but what has management in the NHS got to do idiot Johnson spending ¬£5m to send a letter to 30m households that took 2 weeks to deliver telling people to stay home? I said the money could be better spent - I didn't mention the NHS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chefdeals @BorisJohnson Agree totally!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie Absolutely - took dog to local park after lunch - literally 25yds from my front door - I was only person there - apart from a gang of about 10 teens, sitting together under the trees like it was normal times! Still so many don't get it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noseybstard @RTUKnews That's what's called "giving them a bum steer!" üòÇüëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@withorpe I wonder how many who've lost a loved one will agree with "forget" an enquiry! Government should always be held to account since their first duty is to protect &amp; safeguard those they represent!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mark19871999 @HackneyAbbott That's refuges (which is what she said) - where people go to seek refuge from domestic abuse! Not refugees!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chefdeals @BorisJohnson Shouldn't happen should it! But I think, even if government don't deliver what they should, the public will step in to fill the void with support, because they recognise the value of the #NHS &amp; what a mess we'd be in now without them! #NHSheroes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @ronstanding @BorisJohnson Yes - I meant dying too - not dieing! Hey ho!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KomradeKlassics @bobruss46 @BorisJohnson Absolutely correct!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mouseysally @BorisJohnson Twice the support then! Lol - count yourselves lucky! üëçüòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chefdeals @BorisJohnson Isn't that shocking - big hospital, serving a huge area, badly let down by government!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @ronstanding @BorisJohnson Quite!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @BorisJohnson Absolutely - and isn't that the point! No magic money tree - unless it's for self promotion! "Stuff #NHS staff dieing on the front line - we'll sent a letter to everyone to show I'm a nice, caring guy!" #Herd_Immunity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had the letter that @BorisJohnson sent to 30m households a week ago this morning! Didn't that cost taxpayers about ¬£5m? And cause post office staff a lot of extra work! Very old info now by time we got it!  What a pathetic waste of money when there are better ways to spend it!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus No, I sent him down to Waitrose to get the smoked salmon &amp; caviar....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus That was exactly the point of my trip. A "tank" down a fast main road &amp; a drive back down country lanes! No stopping, no contact with anyone! Lovely morning, change of scenery, blossom out, lambs in the field! Bliss! I needed it! So did car!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AldoM72 @Rachael_Swindon Exactly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Took car off drive for first time in about 3 weeks today - can't believe how busy roads still are! Saw, at local petrol station, how much price of petrol/diesel has dropped!

<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @TaffieBaggie Yes, I know exactly what you mean!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @TaffieBaggie I didn't! We elected an independent MP at his second election in this constituency over his hospital policies &amp; I was on council as an independent! Couldn't support him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Pretty horrid down here but most people are being very careful now. Test will be this weekend &amp; if people respect it the suggestion is new cases should peak very soon. Fingers crossed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie @HairyAngus Well exactly - his hero was Maggie &amp; she said he was her greatest success!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Yea but Tony Blair is a Tory so you'd expect him to say that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislepkowski Great stuff Chris! Ron was a pretty decent guy as well as being  full of good stories!

<|startoftext|>@BBCBreaking Not a fan of the Tories or Johnson as a PM, but my god there are some nasty people on here! How can anyone not wish him a full recovery? This is a man's life in danger here,  it's a bit more serious than disagreeing with his politics! #GetWellBoris<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brynbaggie @AmySeaker You're absolutely right on all points! Which is why government needs to take a stronger line! If social distancing saves lives shutting shops, restaurants, loads of small businesses etc, then it certainly should apply to construction sites where social distancing is impossible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is disgraceful - business, profit still being put before peoples safety,  yet most of us are told to stay home to save lives! Weak government &amp; double standards! Tremendous sympathy for anyone put in this position @AmySeaker #Covid_19 #StayHomeSaveLives<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>There's a pragmatism from Labour members electing #KeirStarmer as leader!

<|startoftext|>"Virus patients more likely to die may have ventilators taken away" This isn't what Nye Bevan had in mind in the setting up of the NHS! A sad state of affairs &amp; very unfair on those who have to make the choices!    https://t.co/WWtSDKBYK7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScruffBaggie Yes the FA, in its early days, tried to stop professional players coming into the game to protect the fact the top teams, all from the south, were all made up of wealthy public school old boys! As soon as professional players got involved, the "old boy" teams were eclipsed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScruffBaggie Don't worry - I did wonder why the owner of "Blackburn" when he turned up, wasn't specific about whether it was Olympic or Rovers but I just presumed it was Olympic because they had success before Rovers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScruffBaggie Only just watched up to episode 2 so far but I'm hooked!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just got into this! Great stuff - the history of football &amp; Lancashire cotton strikes pretty accurately portrayed. Well worth a watch if football or social history interest you! #TheEnglishGame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gingerzola No he was sacked well after Pulis went &amp; that relegation season January window had passed! Jenkins came &amp; was horrified how club finances had deteriorated but too late to save season!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gingerzola Wasn't it Williams who was CEO during that time, who also presided over the demise of Blackburn whilst he was there! Appointed by Peace, before he went too! The incompetence of those running club that season is actually negligent!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies @WestBromNews Without it &amp; dropping to final payment next season, if still in Championship, retaining current squad is probably not possible! It's why promotion this season is so important!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billybassett68 @bartlebee24_ If Greasy Jack was sent out there now he'd make the most of the trip...so nothing new there then! üòâüòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WestBromNews Hard to cover for any club...but more significant will be the loss next season of ¬£120m+ if this season is void &amp; promotion doesn't happen! #WBA #LUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Albion_2020 I was born by the sea &amp; go back whenever I can - but live in Worcestershire now - &amp; miss it terribly! Even worse at moment with #covid„Éº19uk cos don't know when I can travel there again! You are lucky - enjoy &amp; make the most of it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Albion_2020 You are lucky you have the beach on your doorstep - it's a long drive for me &amp; don't know when I will even see it again! Hard times!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Change then was very slow though! The growth of technology, improving transport, less menial jobs, better income, better health care for all, better education - all which speeded up incrementally in late 50's/early 60's - accelerated change to a level it hadn't been at before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus That's the point though isnt it? The post war years were very grey &amp; austere but it all changed in early 60's when wealth grew, choice grew, education improved &amp; people's expectations lifted from being forelock tuggers who accepted their lot! Progress generally speeds up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus I think people probably all looked the same then because there was a lack of fashion choice, it wasnt a similarly of thinking/outlook that drove them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus You absolute b*****d! That looks awesome - want some now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Doubt it! The "me first" attitude has changed so many! Give it a few weeks &amp; if were still in "lockdown" the atmosphere will be getting toxic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus I love a good fish soup! We've done ok so far - got fresh chicken on Saturday &amp; had it roast yesterday - so cold sandwiches today! But little pleasures take on a bigger relevance at the moment! Imagine 6 years of this in WW2! My respect for those who went through it grows daily!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Wait till we get to powdered eggs &amp; spam! Sounds like you're doing better at the moment!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel a cold chicken sandwich coming on! #lunch #hungry #lockdownuk Doing the best with what we have! #Covid_19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@romerlyn Haven't got a clue what graphics card it is! Unless Nvidia is the maker!? It's a Chillblast pc - custom built<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@romerlyn Guy that looked at it last week said it was still high powered, high spec &amp; didn't need replacement - it only went out of manufacturer warranty in November<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@romerlyn Done all this - common problem but loads of reasons for it, so hard to fix - took it to a  "professional computer expert" last week &amp; he said he'd fixed it! Got it home &amp; second time opened it problem started again! He wants it back again but little confidence in him now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@romerlyn Not that old - 4/5 years - very high spec machine when new - still great piece of kit till last week! Don't really want to replace it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grombags Me too! üëç (unless 2 bags of wine gums instead of one is considered naughty....) #StopHoarding #stoppanicbuying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NatMansell Thanks Nat - I'll try that in morning. I tend to think its software related but don't know enough, or where to look &amp; a clean reinstall has been suggested which I'm trying to avoid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dcwinter @Kevin_Maguire Comfort food! üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ianrobo1 You're not the first to suggest that......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NatMansell No but we did down load drivers for video camera (now disconnected again) so wife could have face to face with work! Problem seemed to start then! Looked for drivers to delete again but can't find them! Does that make sense?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreePeaceSweet @_Fletch__ No - not hard drive. When problem started it was suggested it might hard drive so it was replaced - worked for about 5 minutes then problem started again! Runs perfect ok when it's running &amp; new hard drive has speeded it up but just problem booting normally!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wezzaboing74 Thanks - I think the updates are up to date! üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Fletch__ @ThreePeaceSweet By the way, would a problem with RAM cause it to run slower than it did?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Fletch__ @ThreePeaceSweet Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreePeaceSweet No - it's a desk top pc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreePeaceSweet Thank you - I'll have a look<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreePeaceSweet Duh! See that's the problem....I turn it on and use it! Software I can tweak but don't have a clue on the internal bits. But thanks for reply.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhallopAOTS In normal times I imagine it's an easy fix - summat needs tweaking - but where do you get an expert to come in lockdown! And wife needs to work from home &amp; needs PC! Timing for it to play up is f******g brilliant! May resort to hammer approach.....on PC...not wife!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Advice any computer buffs please? PC won't boot into Windows on startup - starts to open then goes black screen and stops - only openable in bios with "safe mode" or "last good configuration" - but doesn't solve problem - same next time! Repair tool, restore point don't fix it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kevin_Maguire Poach it, flake it, mix it into freshly cooked pasta, add cheese sauce, black pepper any chopped veg you might have, 10 mins in oven when done! Very tasty!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Yes.....sign of a confused mind!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies @chrislepkowski Funnily enough I remember John Wile telling the story that, some years later, they played against each other in a game just before JW's testimonial match &amp; as they were walking off after game Jordan walked over to John &amp; said  "Good luck with your testimonial, John!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies @chrislepkowski Yes he did! Always had a bit of a soft spot for Hartlepool - perennial failures - any manager that could do well with them was probably destined for greatness - ie Clough!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies @chrislepkowski Agree totally! I championed Wilder as my favourite option for Baggies a couple of years ago &amp; got absolutely hammered on here! Rate him very highly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies @chrislepkowski Yes he was a very good manager! Think you judge how good a manager is if they can be successful at more than one club - he was!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislepkowski Look after yourself!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislepkowski Love books Chris! Words well used are so powerful! Keeping fine thanks - hopefully it stays that way! Hope you are too?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Yes ok ta! Wife is a nurse manager in research &amp; is currently working from home but may have to go on a ward again after about 10 years off! Not good - but fingers crossed she won't! Get a nice bottle of single malt, if I were you &amp; chill! Special measures!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pcmac41 @TheVan @BBCBreakfast I'm grateful for Netflix!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterBone1 I find a nice bottle of Glenmorangie has the same therapeutic input!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVan Good &amp; sensible call!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@psclarke86 Absolutely - I turned it off &amp; turned it on again a couple of hours later &amp; got exactly the same stuff again! Ridiculous - news will have more impact when it's a set times &amp; people turn on to hear it! Drip feed all day dilutes it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVan I turned it off at 10.00 - turned it on again couple of hours later &amp; deja vu!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really not sure why BBC need to transmit seamless, repetitive news most of day on #BBC1? Perhaps some at home isolating might enjoy a bit of escapism &amp; not a constant reminder of why they're there!

<|startoftext|>@cllrfranoborski I'll hold you to that - certainly won't be at Wetherspoons!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pcmac41 Definitely not....they wouldn't want to cause the panic buying it would create! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 Quite - I think this is really going to bite Tim Martin on the bum! Wipe him out, hopefully!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ehayward93 You have every right to feel proud of him Lizzie! All those who serve the public, often in close contact, deserve our admiration &amp; gratitude for the risks they are currently taking.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@anthonyblagg @cllrfranoborski @WillBlackWriter @davidwalliams Always masters involved in the sciences it seems!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ronstanding Understand that but to put out the message "stay home &amp; protect the NHS" gives the wrong emphasis! The message is "stay home, protect yourself &amp; your loved ones!" The call on the NHS is the consequence of not doing that! Chicken - egg!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ronstanding @Iancoll94354676 Absolutely right &amp; I agree with you on all points Ron!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 Glad you're home now - well done to your employer, best thing to do! Hope we soon all come through this and get back to normal!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaoloWalnuts Quite - its masses to send<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WhallopAOTS Well quite!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The government trying to "protect the NHS" as priority, tells you much! The first aim should be to protect 67m Brits! Governments first duty is to its citizens - do that &amp; the consequence is it removes pressure on NHS! The message is wrong &amp; isn't convincing many! #Coronavid19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShaneoTheBaggie Nothing new but not paying his staff &amp; told them to get jobs at Tesco's whilst they are laid off! Just the boycott # keeps spelling company name wrong!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daiseyrai Take care Di - hope son stays safe. I'm ok but my wife is a nurse manager in research trials, so she's working from home at moment but may have to go back on a ward in a couple of weeks  - I'm shitting myself for her quite frankly!

<|startoftext|>Don't want to be too pedantic but it should be #BoycottWetherspoons not #boycottweatherspoons - anyway....boycott them!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@griffraces Frightening Ian! By keeping people at work or not paying them if they stay home, they not only put their employees at risk, but all those they come in contact with....all to continue making a profit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When this is over - if I survive it - I will make sure I support those companies who treat their employees right at this time &amp; I will boycott those who don't!

<|startoftext|>@LMc10_SAFC @WillBlackWriter @davidwalliams Haha! That's what I call style! Ours had a size 14 slipper for wacks cos it was more supple &amp; offered more pain than a size 9! Kids today don't know how lucky they are!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LMc10_SAFC @WillBlackWriter @davidwalliams Quite - his skill was special but all the masters had it to some degree!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WillBlackWriter @davidwalliams My old chemistry master was a dead shot with a blackboard rubber! He'd be writing on the board with his back to the class, hear something behind him, spin round, throw, all in one movement &amp; hit the target every time! Awesome!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 I feel for you mate - I hope it gets sorted soon - just protect yourself as best you can &amp; take care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 If your firm is telling you to go in perhaps they are the twats since they are putting their business/profit before your health &amp; safety &amp; possibly your life!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StephenWFLabour You know I'm no fan of Tories/Johnson/Brexit but there is just as clear a message here from govt promoting their line as there was over Brexit - just this doesn't fit the agenda some want to face up to so they pick holes in it. Very perverse!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are some thick twats in UK! The message is clear - stay home cos if you don't kill yourself you may kill others - are you so brain dead that if it isn't spelled out in words of one syllable it isn't clear &amp; the agenda you have is how to get round it! #StayHomeSaveLives<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheVan Quite - do it now - not a few days before deadline! Hard times but need to be pragmatic &amp; Baggies have been.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVan Good response - well done Baggies!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jeeessuuusss - I wish I was a journalist! Those who are currently, especially #BBC ones, are a totally, government compliant, waste of space! Some really hard questions need asking &amp; no one has the balls to do it! Accountability of government at this time affects us all! #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HackneyAbbott Quite! 3 months with the option to renew/extend if needed, would have been adequate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnWest_JAWS @up_again If you can shut pubs, restaurants etc  immediately, presumably making hospital car parking free for NHS staff is a breeze for those running the country! And didn't our PM say some time ago he had ensured hospital car parking was free for EVERYONE? #boristheliar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a "fun" thread to read &amp; while away a few minutes if you're bored at home! I found it takes an an enjoyable dimension if read with a nice Glenmorangie malt! However it is, of course, utter tripe.... @TripeUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PonderfulUK Thank you - I hadn't seen the Lancet study - but the principle holds good. Proper isolation/lock down is the way we need to go.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ronstanding @up_again Strewth.......!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ronstanding @up_again Don't joke....on the other hand do...! If it stops people buying both, I might be able to get some next time I shop! üëçüòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ronstanding @up_again Quite! Apparently some supermarkets are limiting to 3 of anything - which actually encourages people to buy more! A bunch of 5 bananas (example) is "one" measure - 3 bunches is 15 bananas! Who  buys 15 bananas in one go, but people are now! Half will be in the bin before eaten!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ronstanding @up_again Anyone with a brain knows that Ron, but someone said a week ago there was a shortage of loo rolls &amp; pasta &amp; consequently people panicked &amp; bought up everything! Then it's a vicious circle &amp; because shelves are empty idiots think there's shortages!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Lench Absolutely - so many in denial - crazy isn't it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ronstanding @AuthorMonika We have a large Polish community in the UK cos many of them came here during &amp; after the war to escape the holocaust! There was a Polish squadron in RAF who fought &amp; died for us! Kidderminster had a refuge camp &amp; many descendants are here now! Don't judge!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cllrfranoborski And you Fran.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It ain't rocket science - but am I naive to think if everyone stayed home for two weeks #COVID19 wouldn't be able to infect any one new &amp; would be defeated!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Rcc217W @Donwyn6 Human "logic" - there's a virus so there "must be shortages of bog roll soon so I'll buy as many as I can" &amp; help create it! I really feel for those with young children! Apparently idiots are buying dried baby milk to put in hot drinks cos they can't get fresh milk! Madness!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Donwyn6 @Rcc217W Absolutely - both my daughters have offered to shop for me but they both already have to shop for 4 in each family! They need everything they can get! I'm not supposed to go out with compromised immunity - so I was going out shopping late when no one was about! Pointless now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vicky155616 Crumbs....thanks! üòÅ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rcc217W Absolutely right! I need a few basics, that's all, but I can't get them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vicky155616 I'm sure you are right - but if panic &amp; greed hadn't set in the first place there'd be no need for queueing for basics at 6 in the morning for someone like you! It becomes a vicious circle doesn't it! How many there at that time now would have been there this time last week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rcc217W That's exactly the problem isn't it! The panic buying over weekend has created the shortages &amp; as soon as stocks are put back people buy them. No slack in food chain now, which there usually is! But it's been caused by panic, not by actual shortages.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scan1968 I think it will settle down in a few days now the supermarkets are limiting quantities. The shambles of bulk buying over weekend &amp; early this week must have had a negative effect on stocks that haven't built up again yet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scan1968 Yes but everyone going early is emptying the shelves which is why there is nothing there at 3.30! Last week you could shop 24 hours a day and get what you want! Realistically that supply hasn't changed - there is still enough if people weren't dickheads, panicking &amp; hoarding!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSock Madness isn't it! Trouble is the media report it first happening somewhere, say it isn't a problem &amp; no need to panic &amp; human nature is everyone thinks "oh I better be safe &amp; stock up" and it creates panic that gets worse as more people panic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PonderfulUK @KateVasey Quite - I have "isolated" for a week but walk the dog in the local park every day away from anyone else &amp; drive to somewhere quiet in the countryside for a walk away from others! It's easy enough &amp; I'm still staying away from risks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Snorkyno4 @StephenWFLabour Quite - it's all a bit brain dead really since people catch the virus from close contact with someone infected - so they get in close contact with 100's of others in a packed supermarket! Hardly good judgement on a number of levels!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie Frightening isn't it! Morons! Don't know how some of the current community would cope if they were living through the last war! We've have 3 days of this so far! Imagine having it for 6 years!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All the people whinging about queueing in the crowds at supermarkets at 6.00 in morning are at supermarkets at 6.00 in morning &amp; are part of the problem! If everyone had just carried on shopping normally there wouldn't have been any problem! Self perpetuating! #panickbuying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Danniwozere @huntywbafc Needs a quick act of parliament under emergency powers to limit the mark up on the RRP! Manufacturers won't have changed their prices to distributors so it's either the wholesaler or retailer that's profiteering! Needs stopping!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Danniwozere Hope so Danni!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Danniwozere I'm horrified that a chemist, whose role is to serve the community, sees a disaster as an opportunity to make a few quid extra by ripping off the people they rely on in normal times!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Danniwozere Good - it's the only way to deal with profiteering like that! Make the shop the one to suffer!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Danniwozere Whoops  *too* gentle....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Danniwozere That's exploitation of the worst kind! The community need to boycott them &amp; put them out of business! Scum is to gentle a description!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Danniwozere That's appalling!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@draftsmann @damocrat @LastBlairite üòâyea but I'm not! üòÅ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 Always an opportunity for lawyers! Going to be fascinating watching this resolve itself isn't it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@garwalbion @damocrat @LastBlairite Yes I like a drop of port too! With a nice strong cheese!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@garwalbion @damocrat @LastBlairite Yea but makes my head fuzzy.....üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 I think they want to but it obviously depends how long the risks remain for players &amp; spectators. Playing behind closed doors is an option but clubs outside PL need income from paying customers! Redistribution down of tv money an option but PL clubs would probably oppose that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@magneticsparrow @TheVan Think the big problem is putting together next seasons squads isn't it? Until clubs know which league they're in they can't get on with player recruitment for next season. It effects budgets, contracts &amp; really there has to be a bit of a gap between seasons to let all that happen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@damocrat @LastBlairite Absolutely....onwards &amp; upwards! Indestructible me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@damocrat @LastBlairite No - I had my first large(ish) malt at 11.45! Brightened the day considerably!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray Have to say the "75% call it final" option is my favourite approach too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been buying books in my home town, when I've been there, for more years than I care to remember! So disappointed @harbourbooks are calling it a day. Wonderful people! Remember too with great fondness the lovely Pirie &amp; Cavender book shop that closed in 2008! Sad times #whitstable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WestBromNews It isn't just in the EFL's gift to give though is it? Anything has to be acceptable to the PL, since it affects them too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVan Absolutely - tricky for them - &amp; they probably need to ensure PL &amp; EFL both eventually decide on an agreed joint approach.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaldBaggie @TheVan Lol - my supermarket shelves look like Apocalypse Now! Nothing to see here!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVan Interested to see comments from FA today saying they have a selection of scenarios for all options which they aren't putting in public domain at this time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanPGlasgow It's about income for clubs though isn't it! PL clubs aren't dependent on fans at games, Sky see to that, but c Rochdale, Burton, Walsall etc need fans at games to keep them in business! The "hit" of finishing this season unfinished is less financially than starting next late!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVan Most of what happens on twitter 99% of time is pointless speculation really isn't it? But we all engage in it. Life would be pretty tame &amp; sterile without it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoodWBA Wrecks too many teams finances though! PL can hack it cos gate money is petty to them but for lower league clubs it keeps them in business! Worrying times isn't it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVan We'll see. It is irrelevant in short term but some of the comments I've seen about finish this season, start next season late, scrap next season to finish this first etc, are crazy! Hence the choice is, void or use current positions as final! Void we don't go up, final we do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I tend to take view now that this season won't play out its remaining games! Even when peak of #covid19UK passes, big sports crowds still risky for weeks! So choice is, void whole season or take current positions as final? As a #WBA fan I favour latter - but difficult one! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PA That's fine  - but it will increase the demand for paracetamol, which is already in short supply &amp; hard to get!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 Bless you. Thanks.  You're an üòá<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 Thanks Nicola, much appreciated but ok for a bit. I have half a packet at moment but always buy some more when I get low! However none anywhere yesterday when I tried to get some! Chemist gave me the "sharp intake of breath sigh" &amp; pitiful look as if to say "you must be joking!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EtonOldBoys It was never going to be "delayed" or "contained" &amp; any who thought it would were deluded! But then, you summed the reason up for that succinctly &amp; eloquently in your last sentence!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies Quite! Sickening!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruby196840 People are great aren't they! Some never miss the opportunity to make a fast quid or two! There would still be half a million British troops on the beach at Dunkirk now with the attitude of some people at the moment!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies Since the amount you can buy at any one time from a chemist is limited anyway can only presume lots more people have bought it or some are going back multiple times!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruby196840 Tried that! None available - unless you want to pay ¬£20 for a ¬£1 box!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Take paracetamol to bring temperature down? Fine... but its impossible to buy any at the moment! Something else people seem to have stockpiled!  #BBCBreakfast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gingerzola Yes agree - lovely language, lovely people. I sat next to Trapattoni at Villa Park in Euro 96 at Scotland/Switzerland game - really decent guy &amp; immaculate in a suit that must have cost a couple of grand! Italian style too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gingerzola Italian names just role off the tongue don't they! üòÅ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paegpaeg Frightening really isn't it! And so many suck it up as "fact" cos it's on BBC News!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gingerzola Trapattoni - without a doubt!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paegpaeg Actually she's a very clever person &amp; knows exactly what she's doing,  which is being a propaganda mouthpiece for government under the umbrella of being an objective journalist! It's #bbcnews who are culpable for enabling it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LastWordFC Quite simply financial implications of not being promoted from Championship this season is frightening! Same clubs may not repeat it next season! However scrapping PL is ok for top clubs - no financial cost other than gate money (peanuts really) &amp; status quo next season! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JudeWBA You take care too! Thanks for your good wishes! Difficult times but it will end - eventually.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sbaggieboy60 Quite - I couldn't understand the slow response when it was obvious once it started in China it was likely to go global! Planning really needed to start much earlier, not the "softly softly - don't cause panic" approach they seemed to use! Smother it as much as possible early!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Danniwozere It's the lack of knowledge &amp; uncertainties in this that adds to the worry isn't it! I'm sure most people will come through it ok but going to be a hard couple of months! You take care. X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sbaggieboy60 You take care too Shaun. It's the lack of information of what it means if we get it that is the worry! I can cope with most illnesses if I know I'll come out the other side! With this, it's so full of uncertainties.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@duncanjones64 @chrislepkowski I have my moments! Cheers Duncan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Danniwozere You take care too Danni - lupus is not fun - I've always joked I'm totally indestructible but I'm having a rethink! üòä x<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If your going to quote it - its martial law not Marshall law!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@garwalbion Quite - they don't have a clue what some of us live with! Sainsbury's today &amp; absolutely no tea of any description was just one example of nothing left! Tea ffs! Why do people need to hoard that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngelaRayner Wonderful - watch repeats of "One Foot in the Grave" free whilst your locked up at home waiting to snuff it! Every cloud.....! #covid„Éº19uk #tvlicense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ronstanding I loved great radio comedy Ron - Round The Horn, Navy Lark, Goons etc &amp; he was up there with the greats! Very funny man!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As someone with T2 diabetes &amp; no immunity to infection for several other medical reasons, #covid„Éº19uk is likely to kill me if I catch it. Thanks brain dead moronic twats who've emptied the supermarkets, for causing me to spend so long seeking basics because of your selfishness!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DickLaurent96 Yes - mine too! Offsets the thoughts of the alternatives!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mr_dead_2012 Quite - PL &amp; EFL have different management committees but I'm sure they will be "talking" to each other! The consensus seems to moving in favour of no relegation from PL &amp; Leeds/Albion going up &amp; making PL 22 next season with 5 relegated at end of next season going back to 20!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mr_dead_2012 Wouldn't apply in Championship where all teams have played more than 35 games (75% of 46) - my comment related to how rule effects Baggies! We would finish 2nd! More in football to consider than just PL &amp; each league is treated individually!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can't #StayAtHome &amp; create a #Herd_Immunity - it's one or the other! Government need to really have a good, hard, think about what their policy actually is!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidKe30081373 Isn't it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidWoodydr Welcome to the piss heads club! üòÅüëçüòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've found the best antidote for #coronavirusuk is copious quantities of a decent malt whisky! It doesn't keep you safe from it but it numbs the senses &amp; ensures you don't really give a cus anymore! #happydaze<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oeufling @L__Macfarlane Since the view widely expressed when this started in China was that it would go global, the time to start planning was 3 months ago to mitigate its impact when it did  arrive! Our blessed government wait till its here then "react" to its effect! Stable doors - horses - bolted?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mr_dead_2012 @griffraces @WanchopePaulo Yes that's not it! I saw that link aswell. There was another link that specifically related to the the early closure of league competitions!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 @mr_dead_2012 @WanchopePaulo Thanks Nicola - I thought I'd imagined it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@griffraces @mr_dead_2012 @WanchopePaulo Somebody put the printed wording from the FA's detailed rules on line on Friday when the suspension of weekend games was announced! Frankly I was surprised more people hadn't picked it up since it seemed really significant!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mr_dead_2012 @WanchopePaulo I've actually seen the FA written rule on finishing a season/competition early - it's clear. 75% of season complete &amp; league standings are final! Under 75% season void! Unfortunately I can't find it now! I'll keep looking! If an individual club can't finish it results are deleted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mr_dead_2012 @WanchopePaulo I'm not expressing a personal opinion, I'm suggesting what the likely official reason will be when season (probably) isn't played to conclusion. However FA rules are clear on this! If a seasons is ended early after 75% of games played, the current standings are taken as final!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WanchopePaulo Think the problem is government are saying the virus peak won't be passed for another 10 to 14 weeks - that's July! Can't suspend a season &amp; restart after that long! Restrictions on sport/gatherings will be ramped up a lot more before they're relaxed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getpromotionpr Agree - consensus seems to be to end the season now with final positions, promote Leeds &amp; us, relegate no one from PL &amp; run it with 22 teams next season! That's fine for PL but what happens to relegation from Championship, L1 etc unless they just promote &amp; don't relegate anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizJRudd Oh that's ridiculous! The end of civilisation as we know it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 Hope not! Saw something that said FA rules say if 75% of games completed &amp; season ends then positions are taken as they are now! We've completed over 75% of fixtures. Think a legal challenge from Leeds &amp; us likely if EFL try to void the season! Worrying though isn't it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Danniwozere People will stoop as low as they have to, to look after themselves! Sadly there are a lot of self centred, selfish people about!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ronstanding Yes agree entirely on all points Ron - two games a week sorts it easily - just worry that this virus will rumble on till the summer &amp; restarting the fixtures won't be possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Danniwozere I despair of the depths to which some people will sink, Danni! We seem to  have a "me first" mentality now - not nice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is there a more pointlessly boring programme on tv than #moneyfornothing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ronstanding Yes I remember that - but that was weather &amp; finite - it would eventually end &amp; didn't effect people's health! This virus is randomly infecting people and its impossible to say when that will stop - until that is clearer a restoration of normal football is impossible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alansmoore @rjdowning QED! Simple isn't it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rjdowning Depends on how many clubs get players infected really! That seems to be starting now &amp; if it spreads it will quarantine too many clubs to make any games viable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@huntywbafc I hope so but the general feeling seems to be 3 April is a definite non-starter &amp; they can't keep moving it back a couple of weeks because decisions need taking that impact on next season! So early June to finish is latest realistically available!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sadly I don't think we'll ever see this season's squad play together again. Doubtful we'll resume this season, the loans will go back &amp; the only question to be answered is which league were in next season! That will be crucial for clubs future over next few years! Worrying! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The government is being reactive &amp; only responding to the situation as it develops/progresses! Surely a proactive approach to attempt to preempt progress would have been more effective? Feel were being used as pawns in some perverse social experiment! #ukcoronavirus #COVID_19uk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@krueger_nan Likewise üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@krueger_nan Humour/satire is never offensive to me! Life's too short to take offense! Keep up the good work! üòâüòÅ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@krueger_nan Not much to smile about at the moment but that actually made me laugh out loud....thank you so much.ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DickLaurent96 @Unity_MoT Yes I understand that - I was just commenting on an  "expert" opinion I had seen saying a restart on 3 April was almost impossible &amp; voiding of season was a strong option! Agree it would be disastrous on a number of levels &amp; a legal mess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Unity_MoT Yes I agree - but there seems to an opinion "bubbling under" that restarting the fixtures before June may be difficult, in which case scrapping the season may be the only option! Lots of twists &amp; turns yet seem likely!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Unity_MoT Problem is - and it's a big "if" but still a worry - if the season doesn't complete &amp; is voided, we won't be promoted, so parachute payment will go into 3rd year &amp; we will be considerably poorer next season! ¬£8m for Pereira would probably be too expensive for next years budget!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 @Charlieparker32 Papering over the cracks.....! ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ Well quite! But if "old man Steptoe" is partially responsible for the Villa's eventual relegation it's a bonus!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pennwba Yes I read that, but in fact it would create a worse outcome than the Black Death in 14th century &amp; the plague in London in the 17th Century, so that isn't really a realistic scenario! And even if it was right about 95% of those infected recover in a few days! What me worry?  https://t.co/70KKFS73Pa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pennwba Its relative though isn't it! There are 67million people in UK, if a million got it it would be serious by any standards but 66million wouldn't get it! No one wants it but perspective needs to rule, not fear &amp; worse case "what if" attitude that is what everyone sees at present!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pennwba There is obviously a risk to us all which needs to be managed - but the media "wall to wall" doom scenario doesn't help! Over hyping seems to be something the UK media revel in &amp; it doesn't help the current situation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MatthewBroad4 For me he looks a potentially decent striker just not quite firing - I don't have the negative view of him so many do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@phillango Absolutely - exactly how I feel! 3 points at Swansea is the priority after the Wigan game! But what a difference a bit of a tweak at halftime produced!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You get the feeling a stronger starting 11 from Baggies &amp; we could have won that! Good first half from Newcastle though, they made it count! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scoffasmith Agree! You can see why Brunt &amp; Barry don't make the bench most weeks now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rcc217W Absolutely - the gulf between an average PL side &amp; what we have out tonight is huge!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulLovatt2 Yes agree!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Game over! Basically that back 4 tonight is getting pulled all over the place! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RhinoBaggie But the "full" stream with close ups, replays etc is available to Sky to use at every game but they don't use it. They just use a single, variable distance, camera!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies @bfatchett @pennwba Correct. So few players make the step up. I think Harper has the talent to but needs more game time to develop &amp; grow his experience! Agree the removal of short term loans was a backward step for developing young players talent!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett @pennwba Yes - he needs higher level game time to develop than u23 but we can't give him that time in 1st team! Loan at decent League 1 club would be ideal!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett @pennwba Absolutely - if the ball isn't to his feet he has no movement to meet it! Second to everything yesterday! Being a good prospect in U23's &amp; making transition to 1st team is a step too far for so many!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pennwba Harper's lack of tactical awareness is worrying - has skill in abundance but, sadly, don't think he has a "football brain" - Pereira just had a bad day! Hopefully just a blip all round!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PaulGainham Special wasn't it! We were never, ever not going to come out on top yesterday! The belief &amp; togetherness in that squad is amazing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never one to be overly impressed but I thought yesterday was the most complete performance this season so far! Something special happened yesterday! Don't know what it was but the players reaction at full time suggested they know they are on the way! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pcmac41 @HairyAngus Yes, that's also a big issue for some - they have their agenda &amp; want it "massaged!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Quite. Had the conversation with people before election about stuff they were believing cos "it was in the papers, so it must be true!" So deluded &amp; gullible!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus I've been in a queue at supermarket checkout seeing the age of people who buy the Daily Mail &amp; take everything it says as gospel! The "ain't it awful" brigade!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Absolutely right! If you live in a country, should have the right to vote &amp; 16+ has always struck me as right age to get that right!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I find it frustrating that GP's seem unable to take a "whole person" approach to a number of medical conditions in one person &amp; treat each issue in isolation of the bigger picture! The treatment for one condition affects the treatment for another! #frustrating #suffering<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daiseyrai @GoldbergRadio Agree Diane! Been a Baggies fan, through thick &amp; thin, since mid 50's but nearly gave up going those last couple of seasons in PL! Hated everything about it &amp; went out of habit! Thoroughly enjoyed last season &amp; this again in Championship! Can't say imminent return to PL excites!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray @BearwoodBloke Mind you...the other 13 were fun....!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray @BearwoodBloke Quite - definitely one of my 7!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke 7 me! Does that mean I've had a misspent life or just lived a bit close to the edge? ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ - I love the way she just tries to carry on regardless! She could have really taken the piss...! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cllrfranoborski Sad indictment of our media driven world, Fran.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Absolutely - but the media bubble believe life revolves round them &amp; that's it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@roadrep1947 Quite!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Judging by the media coverage, I must be the only person in UK who had absolutely no idea who Caroline Flack was! Sad about anyone who takes their own life, but isn't the media mainly to blame that she did? #CarolineFlackRIP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@londonbaggie @Sjopinion10 Quite right too! It doesn't create a level playing field! The suggestion was that it would!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@londonbaggie @Sjopinion10 In fairness, I think that was Jeremy Peace that was to opposed it? Much maligned by many for his cautious approach to running Baggies but an absolute ace on financial matters &amp; he spotted the danger of this when others didn't!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stevotop @chrislepkowski @SteveMadeley78 Yes - agree but just giving the "official" explanation. I remember the same thing happened to us at Chelsea many years ago when we had goal disallowed cos Ally Brown was actually standing in the goal - not interfering with anything!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stevotop @chrislepkowski @SteveMadeley78 The law requires two players behind him, which is often forgotten cos one will usually be the keeper!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rjdowning Absolutely - happens to all teams over a full season &amp; balances out eventually!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rjdowning Quite - don't mind Leeds winning - it's how far ahead of 3rd we are that matters, not who's second! Opened a decent gap from 3rd again this week!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus üòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kgardner081 @fxckoffRory Agree - but I think with more pace he'd have been a world class player!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray @fxckoffRory Saw them all! Barlow's passing ability was a dream! Chippy was fast, skillful &amp; could score a hat full from the wing, perfect partner to sweep up what Astle didnt! Hope was magical in opening teams up &amp; Kev was a brute of a centre forward &amp; my first hero! Getting nostalgic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fxckoffRory Early days - we need to go up, he needs to stay &amp; prove himself in PL! Then see where it takes him. He's proved nothing yet at top level.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kgardner081 @fxckoffRory Enzo was very talented - his weakness was absolutely no pace!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray @fxckoffRory Agree - he had to face some real hard men in games you don't see now &amp; racial hostility from crowds! Different times wasn't it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray @fxckoffRory Few now have seen us for as long as me........! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fxckoffRory Yes I think so! Big step up from Championship to PL but if he makes that step with us next season &amp; really hacks it, I'd expect the big boys to be having a serious look at him! In terms of skill he has it, just need to see if his "head" is right for PL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @ColinBrowning14 That looks fantastic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @ColinBrowning14 Yes - wouldn't want to fish far from shore at the moment!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fxckoffRory He's a flair player Rory - he'll disappoint on occasions but turn games when he's on song! Cunningham was the same - didn't always deliver, but when he did, he was unplayable! Pereira excites me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fxckoffRory Every generation sees a player or two who are a bit special! I saw my first game in late 50's &amp; have seen many real gems play for Baggies since then! For me Pereira has all the attributes to join them - I think he is genuinely a class act!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @ColinBrowning14 Not sure yet....! But its likely to involve fish!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too much hot English mustard with lunch - making me sneeze! Not complaining though - love it! #yumyum #colman's<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ONONERON The "experts" taking the decisions at the time were government ministers &amp; a senior executive who basically destroyed British Leyland - all based on over ambitious modelling! The real health professionals all said it wouldn't work! Avoidable if the true experts had been heard!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When plans were in place to close Kidderminster A&amp;E on the building of the new Worcester hospital in the late 90's, campaigners warned the emergency provision would be inadequate! Called "scaremongers" at the time, they were right, it's been inadequate for 20 years! #bbcmtd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems that taking back control from "unelected bureaucrats" in EU meant giving it to "unelected advisers" appointed by Cummings to tell Johnson &amp; his lapdog ministers how to run the country! #outofthefryingpan #BrexitShambles #reshuffle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray üòúüëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You feel it's not a case of "if" but "when" - don't blow it second half Baggies! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just found out my old school sports  master, Dudley Kernick, died at 98, just before Christmas! Also manager of Hinckley Athletic, Nuneaton Boro &amp; Kiddie Harriers &amp; commercial manager at #scfc for many years! He was a "bit of a character" but someone for whom I had huge respect!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good night for us - results couldn't be better! Now need to capitalise tomorrow!! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie Yes but he's in Kent, I'm in Worcestershire! Difficult to share a lunchtime drink! Heard from him after not being able to get in touch &amp; knew he'd been in hospital pretty poorly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baggiestex @mark_rollason Yep - so on top that day &amp; still blew it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just found out my lifetime mate who I feared had snuffed it, is alive &amp; well &amp; enjoying his lunchtime pint! Made my day! #indestructible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Hahaha - don't care if it's genuine or not - I can't stop laughing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mark_rollason Usually the way isn't it! Just feel tomorrow we may pull one out! Whoops, me &amp; my big mouth!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mark_rollason Our record there is as bad as at Millwall &amp; look how that turned out! There was a restored "spring in the step" on Sunday - carry that into tomorrow &amp; just maybe.....? #onwardandupward<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mcashmanCBE Inspirational appearance on #BBCBreakfast today Michael. You never fail to hit the spot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@newportbaggie It's a hanging offence! üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyLeeman91 ü§£ü§£üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@psclarke86 Lol ü§£üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just seen a journalist write "there" when he means "their" - don't see myself as the grammar police but just hope that someone who makes a living from words could at least use the right one! #standards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>James Taylor on @BBCBreakfast - lovely to see but starting to make me feel ancient! #BBCBreakfast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow - never read the book so I don't know if it's true to what she wrote - but who cares - its excellent tv! #ThePaleHorse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rob37602138 It's why they have an enclosed compound at the away end &amp; secure walkway from South Bermondsey station - protection of away fans! Shouldn't be needed - don't know any other club that needs that sort of security!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rob37602138 Shocking - always been the same! In my trusting ignorance I drove there once in the 70's and had two tyres slashed whilst parked &amp; at game! Hope you are ok now &amp; got home without too much delay?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is very "dark" never mind pale! Very atmospheric &amp; the period feel is spot on! Enjoying it. #ThePaleHorse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big win but even bigger performance! Impressive! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkMansell Need a second goal don't we! I get nervous at 1-0!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very noticeable today how much of our passing goes forward! It's been square &amp; back for weeks! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mike_meloff That's cos he's a bum.....! ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably our best 45mins since Swansea at home! #MILWBA #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some goal that! #MILWBA #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Raw old game of football this is! Glad to see Baggies are up for it!#wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StigsWBACousin I remember a game called off, late, at Stoke a few years ago! High winds blew a bit off roof of stand about 90 minute before ko &amp; remember reading the clubs safely officer recommended to the ref it should be postponed! Police certainly weren't the ones calling it off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@19jem92 I've known worse in Margate in July! üòâü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett With the upcoming fixtures its really going to be dog eat dog!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett Yes agree! Losing against Luton was unthinkable but next 3 games will define rest of season I think! Really we probably need 7pts at least to start to kick on again! Still a long way to go but playoffs increasingly look like 6 from 7!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All we need to do now is beat the teams around us when we play them...simple.....job done! Oh were it that easy..... this is the Baggies! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@huntywbafc @baggiestex Quite!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baggiestex Hope so - never seen us win at Millwall! Think I saw a 2-2 there once! ü§î #onwardsandupwards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All getting a bit tight at the top! Big couple of weeks coming up! Need some consistency again! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray @AntonDeck @LocalBaggiesFan @Reynox78 @Warren_Stephens @TheVan Absolutely right! Oliver looked outstanding at one stage but injuries &amp; attitude (apparently) ruined his career! It's why I can't really get bothered by this Barry kid ending up at Villa! He's 17 - it'll be 3/4 years before anyone knows if he's going to make it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus You might like this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Wonderful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AntonDeck @LocalBaggiesFan @Reynox78 @Warren_Stephens @TheVan Absolutely the point! It's a bit of a lottery with young players - I remember watching Remi Moses in reserves in the 70's &amp; thinking he'd never make first team! Ron gave him a chance &amp; he flourished at once! But seen dozens of other "great" kids who never make the step up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AntonDeck @LocalBaggiesFan @Reynox78 @Warren_Stephens @TheVan That's the point isn't it! Even those who quit us to go to "bigger" clubs haven't made it with them &amp; have dropped down to lower leagues! There'll always be exceptions who do make it at higher level, but most don't! Most don't even make it with us if you look at last 40 years!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Warren_Stephens @TheVan @Reynox78 @AntonDeck The problem playing untried kids is you don't know if their "head" is right for the step up till you play them, however skillful they may be! Most managers don't risk it. Slav played him preseason &amp; saw enough to give him a chance. If he hadn't shaped up he'd be on loan now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Warren_Stephens Thanks for that - I imagine the confusion came through the other Ferguson. Certainly agree that whoever represents our lad seem a bit dubious in the way they are advising him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ronstanding @undercoot Exactly! His whole career could be on the line.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@undercoot Don't dispute that but both players this agent have represented at the club have thrown rattles out of pram - you just wonder what riches/greener grass agent is promoting! Influence of someone you ask to represent you can be very powerful to a young player!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mason7WBA Thanks - I thought it was. Works well for his clients doesn't he!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I saw somewhere that Ferguson has the same agent at Berahino - does anyone know if that's correct? If so, it might explain a lot! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSock *off* even.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSock I prefer wine gums - more chewy - last longer - and I have a natural aversion to biting heads of babies.... üòâüòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephen_cox_B62 üëçü•≥üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevewhiteraven @Andreww00874110 Yes - remarkable really how big his legacy is when he only recorded for about 18 months!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ONONERON How does a whisky before lunch sound political?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevewhiteraven @Andreww00874110 Mine was Buddy Holly too..."The Buddy Holly Story" in mono...! I still have it!  Cost 25 shillings if I remember correct!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Don't judge.......you'd do the same....üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 Oh every time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you're having a day when you feel like shite a large whisky before lunch works wonders! #handlingownissues #onwardsandupwards #indestructible  #happydaze<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dHHj168p @TheSecondTier Anelka &amp; Samaras were hardly obscure! Not successful with us maybe but they were big, international names before they joined! That forward who came on loan from a Portuguese second division reserve team (name forgotten he was so obscure) must win the vote for obscurity!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ManUtd One of those rare moments in life when you always remember exactly where you were when you heard that terrible news! Came home from school to learn of the horror! From a Baggie fan I, too, will never forget! #FlowersOfManchester<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Butroswba @tpjdavies @chrislepkowski @ronstanding @1968Tv @FootballArchive Just never really "fired" with us - left for Norwich &amp; got a hat full of goals!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DickLaurent96 @tpjdavies @chrislepkowski @Butroswba @ronstanding @1968Tv @FootballArchive Scored about 170 goals in his career  1 in ever 3 games! Managed 5 with us in about 70! We do seems to pick em!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies @chrislepkowski @Butroswba @ronstanding @1968Tv @FootballArchive Never understood why Deehan didn't do better with us! He was a pretty prolific, consistent goal scorer everywhere else he played!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislepkowski @tpjdavies @Butroswba @ronstanding @1968Tv @FootballArchive Yes agree - it's only in hindsight that anyone questions his achievement. Still the best Albion team I've ever seen by a mile! Although I'm told by people who saw the '54 side they were something very special indeed! Actually called "The team of the century" by press of the day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies @Butroswba @chrislepkowski @ronstanding @1968Tv @FootballArchive He certainly didn't sign the majority of the squad involved on the '79 team - only BB - but, in fairness, he did get them "playing!" However, we'll never know if anyone would have managed the same with those players!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichelePaduano I thought your report today on @bbcmtd was excellent &amp; very pertinent at end when you said you'd "like to be able to stop having to report on issues like this!" Quite - the failure of doctors to report this may protect a colleague but it insults the hippocratic oath they take!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies @DickLaurent96 @chrislepkowski @ronstanding @1968Tv @FootballArchive I remember being 1-0 down at home to Villa in 90th minute - Morley ran from halfway line to equalise &amp; we finished up winning 3-1!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@psclarke86 @ChapmanJ92 Absolutely! I've seen the replay! Stinks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@psclarke86 @ChapmanJ92 Yes - so I believe - passed me by! üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChapmanJ92 It's tough at the top mate! Hopefully we'll be back to last on MOTD every week next season! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChapmanJ92 Problem is more of our games are on tv! The ones who get caught are from tv games! Gayle, Peirera etc! The system is wrong allowing trial by tv! Games not televised live seldom, if ever, result in retrospective suspension, despite the fact they are recorded! Its inconsistent!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StagecoachSE Question? This tweet says works are expected to be finished by Sat 25 Jan? Its 4 Feb! An update might be appropriate?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@curious_kent Yes - I bought it last summer! Very enjoyable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @PippaCrerar @DailyMirror No surprised its happened - but a bit surprised the media didn't see it as a likely outcome of a big Tory majority!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PippaCrerar @DailyMirror This is fascism &amp; manipulation of the media - one step from hard right dictatorship! Scary when government chooses who they'll brief!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@latimeralder Exactly - hasn't really been thought through has it! The massive infrastructure changes to make it viable will take many more years, and cost billions more, than has been envisaged!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@latimeralder How can you charge your electric vehicle overnight when millions live in streets with no off road parking at their own house &amp; often can't even park near their own homes?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Baggiepat Actually the Tardis could be really handy in family history research..... #justsaying üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 That is truly appalling Andy!  Shockingly poor judgement a few days after Holocaust Day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@magneticsparrow @1968Tv @FootballArchive Yes - remember it well (as well as 40 years &amp; fading  memory  allows üòâ) cos I think we were the better side that day &amp; would have won without that goal! Can you imagine the Twitter meltdown if our current keeper did that today!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislepkowski @tpjdavies @ronstanding @1968Tv @FootballArchive Mind you he got Garry Pendrey on a free as cover for Statham which wasn't a bad short term deal!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislepkowski @tpjdavies @ronstanding @1968Tv @FootballArchive Yes, I meant first time in charge!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andyforklift @chrislepkowski @tpjdavies @ronstanding @1968Tv @FootballArchive He didn't sign Mulligan  - Giles bought him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies @chrislepkowski @ronstanding @1968Tv @FootballArchive Batson was his best - and cheapest - signing by a mile!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislepkowski @tpjdavies @ronstanding @1968Tv @FootballArchive He'd only been in charge since January &amp; hadn't really changed much! It was the next season it clicked when Robson, Cunningham &amp; Batson all became regulars!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies @chrislepkowski @ronstanding @1968Tv @FootballArchive That's right - remember now! Robson only got bits &amp; pieces then! Ron had only been in charge for about 3 months! Wasn't Mulligan still at right back!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies @chrislepkowski @ronstanding @1968Tv @FootballArchive Was Mick Martin still first choice then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislepkowski @ronstanding @1968Tv @FootballArchive I think he may have had one of his broken legs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KerridgePhil @ronstanding @1968Tv @FootballArchive Makes you wonder doesn't it! Cunningham went for ¬£1m &amp; that was a massive fee at the time - record for an English player moving abroad!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@magneticsparrow @1968Tv @FootballArchive I think it was - 1-1 draw if I remember right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@magneticsparrow @1968Tv @FootballArchive Yes I was there too! Next season was when it all really came together - that team deserved to be champions &amp; probably would have been if there hadn't been a freeze causing a fixture congestion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ronstanding @1968Tv @FootballArchive Yes - Ron's first season wasn't it, he took over in the January before the replay with Man U &amp; Laurie was a bit in &amp; out of the side in Ron's early days!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watched Leo Varadkar on #marr this morning - impressed! Lucky Irish! What a PM should be - this is ours!  https://t.co/QrEAcOEaw7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This time next year he'll be a millionaire.... if he isn't already!#DavidJason<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffreyMorris3 He'll get his own tv programme to host soon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wainhinton Yes - we seemed to relax a bit after second goal! Next 2/3 games big for us cos we could pull away again a bit if we win them with the other teams fixtures!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Farage is now no longer an MEP so #marr has him on to review the papers! Give us a rest from this man please #bbc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wainhinton Hope so! Wasn't a great performance yesterday but it was a win &amp; it'll do wonders for confidence! Also get Peirera &amp; Grady back &amp; the new lads up to speed &amp; we can build on yesterday! I see Leeds next 2 games are away to Forest &amp; Brentford so they can't all pick up points!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulGainham Agree - you saved me writing it! Ponderous is the perfect assessment! Before Christmas our passing was precise, pacy &amp; crisp - opened teams up - now it isn't hurting teams the same! Hopefully the win will start to build confidence again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Back on track today to start another unbeaten run....or 3rd defeat in a row? No choice really is it! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenWFLabour Absolutely! Too many haven't a clue!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenWFLabour As someone who often drives on Kent motorways, especially those linking Dover with the rest of the UK, I'm not sure government really understand the enormity of what they propose! Probably 75% of the HGV's on those roads are of EU origin supplying the UK! Customs checks =chaos??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimMFelton @JaneyGodley Nasty man - but never mind ay "we've got our country back" so he can continue/increase his "unelected" influence!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If we are still hopeful of more signings, club probably need to balance the wage bill a bit! Brunt will still be on a very good contract &amp; if he leaves it gives more flexibility to be spent on others! Sad day but understandable for all parties! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@russellpinnock2 Quite - I said earlier I didn't think he was the problem, more the advice he was getting from his agent who wasn't necessarily putting his clients interest first! People very judgemental without knowing the background!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Johnny_Rudge @JohnnyBeerBoy Some lovely local micro breweries in Kent too these days - worth a trip just for the beer! Early autumn you can get green hop ale, which is beer flavoured with undried local hops! Well worth a try if you're new to it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MAF79 Been of the opinion for some time that Ferguson has never been the problem in any of this - it's been his agent, who has ¬£ signs flashing in front of his eyes! A sad indictment of modern football! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Johnny_Rudge There is a museum down there dedicated to hop farming - near Tonbridge  (The Hop Farm) - well worth a visit if you are down that way! I think after the war over 50000 acres of hop gardens in Kent - latest figures I think were 5000 acres! Sad!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Johnny_Rudge Lol - my great grandad grew hops in Kent! Sad now that we don't produce enough to meet demand for English beers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sicoop01 @bfatchett Don't disagree but don't think it will happen now! Think if Ferguson stays, we're done. On observation, not a favoured opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Johnny_Rudge Belgian, German, Dutch or English? üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@huntywbafc @bfatchett Think anyone else was dependent on getting a big fee for Ferguson, which doesn't seem its going to happen now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett Agree - I've no issues with either! A bit of pace &amp; flair added, which we needed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think we're done in this window now, aren't we? No more in, no one out, including Ferguson! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andyjoneswrites Playing on a weekly basis &amp; having an underlying problem that may be issue in future aren't necessarily the same! If a club spends a lot on a 19 yo they don't want him having to retire at 21 with a knackered knee! However it all sounds a bit "odd" to me! Playing games!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke @ronstanding Haven't seen that yet. Heard very good reports!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ronstanding I didn't think it lived up to the hype! The final few minutes are powerful but the rest was average.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 üòúx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure whether to watch "Dunkirk" on Netflix or repeats of "Little Britain" on catch up tv today! Either seems appropriate - I suppose it depends on your perspective! #BrexitDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke @raihennefer @AllAlbion Yes I think so but the Luton incident was some years before and a cock up, not intentional!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@raihennefer @AllAlbion Was it? Thank you - I had at the back of my mind that Nobby Stiles was in temporary charge at the time so the dates you mention tie in with that! In fact, I think he drove the minibus!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Daughter's (@LittleChickFilm) Drama Workshop (@Dramaworkshop) has its 10 year anniversary evening at Cresent Theatre in Birmingham at 6pm on 29 March.

<|startoftext|>@DerekPoulton @JosephMasi_Star A good journalist talks to people, hears things &amp; never discloses his sources or compromises them! You shouldn't really ask him where he gets his info! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosephMasi_Star We don't disagree! But we get all the rumours, speculation &amp; hype for a month &amp; sod all happens, then in the last evening it all "comes together" &amp; this is a situation artificially created by football as a "positive" progression when they introduced it! I'm not a fan of window!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosephMasi_Star Not having a go at you Joseph for your observations! Just think the whole transfer window charade is a joke! Artificial &amp; ridiculous! Clubs play brinkmanship &amp; last minute deals are so unnecessary!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosephMasi_Star 36 hours to deadline! Heating up? There's already been 30 days of window to get things done! This isn't heating up...its faffing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@huntywbafc @DoodWBA @tomwba1982 Quite - play to strengths not weaknesses!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@huntywbafc @DoodWBA @tomwba1982 Somebody did an analysis a few years ago of goals scored! 90% came from less than 3 passes after a long lump up field by the keeper! Short tippy tappy out of defence isn't going to get results!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoodWBA @tomwba1982 Agree - but all coaches seem to use that approach at moment - its flavour of the month - personally I think its brain dead but what do I know - knock it long &amp; win second ball on halfway line is my approach - not 27 passes to get out of own penalty box!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoodWBA @tomwba1982 Yes but 2 defenders stand yards from Johnston offering the short ball! They must be told to do that by Slav! If they weren't, they wouldn't be there &amp; Sam wouldn't have that option &amp; would kick it long!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoodWBA @tomwba1982 Don't think they're dumb, they just do what the manager tells them to! But they need to be given freedom to decide based on how opposition respond! Week after week you see teams cock up short play from the back! Coaches to blame, not players!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@magneticsparrow @AllAlbion Lol - we book the coach now but apart from that.........!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllAlbion That's "away" of course, not home, but still "worth" remembering! ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllAlbion ...the time the club secretary forgot to order the team coach for a mid week away game there &amp; the players went by youth team minibus! The kit followed in the boot of two cars! We lost! We were a shambles of a club from top to bottom then - early 90's but forget exact year!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donsview For people of a certain age....this comes to mind!  https://t.co/WQYuxIFaD8<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StigsWBACousin Be a huge tome.....and a lot of takers! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrissies141 @snarka Some great players at the club in those days Christine! Kevan, Howe &amp; Robson all England players! Couldn't believe we sold Kevan! Still, we did basically replace him with Astle - so not all bad!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brynbaggie @kevkeywba @snarka Typical of him - genuinely lovely guy! Playing against him was a very special moment for me cos he was my first football hero! You don't forget things like that, do you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevkeywba @snarka That's the time I started going, late 50's. Too young then to really understand, at the time, how good some of those players were but Allen &amp; Barlow would have been outstanding in any era!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevkeywba @snarka That's a great legacy - he was a great striker &amp; a lovely guy. I played in goal against him once when he was at Ansells, right at the end of his career! I was about 10st wet &amp; he was about twice that by then! He clattered me - I knew about it!! ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snarka The King going was right up there with Kevan for me too - but Kev was the first big sale in my time &amp; difficult to understand when you're really young! Not bothered by comings &amp; goings now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulLovatt2 Yes - we've all got them! Just think the younger you are when they go, the more it hurts!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I was a kid #baggies sold my 2 heroes, Don Howe &amp; Derek Kevan, in pretty quick succession - both were England internationals - I was gutted! 60 years on, both I &amp; the club have survived! Players come &amp; go - it doesn't really matter - the club is bigger than individuals! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ferguson's agent on a big bung over this? If the lad had ambition &amp; really wanted a big move he'd hang on till summer &amp; increase his options! Baggies being sensible cashing in now! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guardian "Fanciful &amp; deranged!" - a straight lift from his CV?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KP24 Not polluting Twitter with shite is advice you should live by!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie @magneticsparrow @wezzaboing74 Frustrating thing is, we're not dropping points because teams outplay us, we drop points because we gift them silly goals through mistakes! Cut out the "gift wrapping" &amp; we'd be about 10 points better off!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie @magneticsparrow @wezzaboing74 Agree - next month is season defining! Need another unbeaten run but some tough games coming up! I do think if we slip out of top 2 we won't get back! Confidence must be shot now so big test for Slav to show he can rebuild it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@magneticsparrow @wezzaboing74 We have a history of fading in second half of season - done it several times! Injuries, tired legs, suspensions etc, kick in &amp; we never seem to really strengthen the squad in January cos we're "doing ok" &amp; we suffer as a result! Never learn!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@magneticsparrow @wezzaboing74 Yes I don't think its wise to mess with a team that is doing well if you don't need to! Always remember, under Clark, we were 4th after 8 wins in first 13 games &amp; he made a hat full of changes away to Swansea, we were awful, lost 3-0 &amp; never really got our form back!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wezzaboing74 Hope you're right! I'm quite pleased we've signed Robinson but we do need more in!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wezzaboing74 Yes very true!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wezzaboing74 Absolutely right! Also we seldom get on the overlap &amp; spend too much time trying to short pass through the centre of teams! Creates nothing in the box!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoodWBA @Benhadlington1 A manager can motivate players to over perform for a bit but eventually it stops being effective &amp; they return to their true levels! That's when it needs freshening up! Our best 11 is ok but after that the weaknesses are exposed &amp; its why we've started to struggle!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie Quite - but the goals we've given away in this run because of individual mistakes &amp; poor in game decision making is ridiculous - without them we'd be 7/8 pts better off &amp; still clear at the top!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPridsta We never build from a strong position! The worry is, second half of season players often struggle more for fitness &amp; form, carry injuries etc. We need 2/3 signings to cover for that, but doubt it'll happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPridsta I'm increasingly coming to that view! Need to get on a role again but don't think that's going to happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Surreybaggie The worry is if we don't go up this season, next season it's harder cos parachute payment drops by about ¬£20m &amp; this squads wages are not sustainable next year in Championship - so financially, we just get washed into the pack!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wezzaboing74 Agree! However, without silly mistakes we'd probably have got 2 more pts each at Barnsley &amp; Charlton, 1 tonight &amp; 1 against Stoke! 6 more points &amp; it looks a lot different - basically all down to poor defending! But were looking to sign attacking players!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wezzaboing74 Quite! We haven't won a league game since Grady got injured! He has pace, flair &amp; unpredictability,  opens teams up! Like Barnes last season, we were too dependent on one player!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4 points out of last 21! If club need a wake up call of need to enter transfer market before Friday that's just confirmed it! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We scored from a penalty and apart from that we really created nothing! Very predictable build up without Pereira &amp; Grady! No flair at all! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Suicide again! Shambolic play lead up to that free kick! Trippy tappy out from the back causes so many mistakes! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett Not very bright...some of them, sometimes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Suckers! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sharper, more positive passing than in recent league games but final balls have been woeful! No end product &amp; totally punchless! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@curious_kent Thanks. I'm sure I will enjoy it! I have a big collection of books on the county, many really old &amp; hard to find now! I find Kent's history, folk lore, traditions, way of life, etc fascinating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@curious_kent I've got your book on order. Do you have a confirmed release date yet, other than February?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darr3nHall @Samsung I think for some reason it changed some of my settings - normally an upgrade doesn't, but this one did - I've sorted most of it out again now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@terrywoneill A shade over the top! And the bananas looked like they'd seen better days!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@terrywoneill Judging by the plastic wrapped food she was shown eating on a train the other day she has no cause to comment on my emissions! It's all relative!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 Was going but hurt my knee &amp; walking is painful still - couldn't do West Ham on Saturday either - looks like its red button for me tonight - sod really!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Foods arrived....#healthyeating #not!  https://t.co/wt5y2fi5zN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lunch.....well the start anyway before the food arrives!  https://t.co/YFvLPAu9xm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie @BaggieinNewport Lol - I'm sure if she had have gone home at 3 today her employer would probably be cute enough to smell a rat without my intervention! üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaggieinNewport Couldn't you feel "poorly" about 3 &amp; ask to go home early? üòâ #creativethinking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeefyBaggie1965 @terrywoneill Quite - "due diligence" in buying a player always very thorough (slow!) under Jeremy but selling the club wasn't done so thoroughly in hindsight!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baggiestex @huntywbafc @terrywoneill I love a good intellectual debate on football finance.... ü§£ü§£ü§£üòú<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@terrywoneill I agree - all the talk of signings is mainly media hype imo. Might do a loan deal but don't see us spending any money on anyone permanent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@terrywoneill Frustrating really - one good push from promotion, but if we don't do it this year need to make serious economies on players contracts next season since parachute payment drops significantly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@terrywoneill I think he's hamstrung in his ability to sell too isn't he? Read something recently about him facing Chinese government sanctions if he sell club to buyer outside China for less than he paid!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@griffraces @CPWTweets @Samsung They are far too expensive! I made a big mistake going there - much cheaper, equivalent deals to be had elsewhere!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CPWTweets @griffraces @Samsung The phone performance was fine for 18 months until last @Samsung "upgrade" last week!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@griffraces @Samsung Yes @Samsung interested to hear your comments! I got my current phone at Carphone Warehouse @CPWTweets - never again! They are a complete shower!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@griffraces @Samsung Shambolic now! Yes my battery is draining quickly too! Doesn't last a day now &amp; I haven't changed how I use phone! I'd happily upgrade but my contract won't let me till July!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mark_rollason @Samsung It's not just me then! I thought I was being paranoid!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The latest @Samsung update has completely messed up my phone! Is this universal? Has no security cos opens with a swipe despite password &amp; host of other issues too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yum yum! Never disappoints! @Samphirewhit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaggiesRoger @FootballThen England were well served for centre halves then but in any other era he'd have been an England regular! Best uncapped defender in country in his day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @thenativebubble Might give it a try......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @thenativebubble I've had Cullen Skink a couple of times - wonderful dish! Never tried to make it though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCCountryfile @mattbakerfans @MargheritaT @LeyshonOwen Looking forward to Dungeness next week - one of my favourite places in UK! Quirky &amp; an acquired taste but fascinating &amp; unique.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephen_cox_B62 - happy memories! üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sbaggieboy60 Yea....I've done much drinking &amp; pillaging....&amp; not only in Reading!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@magneticsparrow @Sbaggieboy60 Well if it was away we know where we'd be playing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sbaggieboy60 Yes - been to Reading several times and no good memories....except this ...lads day out!  https://t.co/utT7fnBtJh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sbaggieboy60 Oh yes - forgotten about them! Shit...nailed on! ü§£ü§£ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd like to think I'm wrong &amp; we get a decent home tie, but you can almost guarantee we'll be drawn away at Chelsea or Man City in 5th Rd draw tomorrow! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think a penalty &amp; a yellow card was sufficient there! Red a bit harsh! Game over now so may as well stop watching! #MCIFUL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daiseyrai @stephen_cox_B62 @Lisa_McNally1 Stressed?? Who?? MEEEEEEE!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Disgorger @tomwba1982 @pox1 ü§£ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ALBIONFANTV Simple thing was for FIFA/EUFA to tell Villa to deduct the money owing to Albion from the fee going to Barca &amp; pay it direct to Baggies! But that's too simple!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomwba1982 @pox1 Deluded.......but I'm not saying on which point.....ü§£ üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@magneticsparrow @CharlieBunyan @FootballThen Yes I think that was the exact figure. First transfer of ¬£500k+<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Disgorger @CharlieBunyan @FootballThen Absolutely! I remember reading somewhere that Clough only signed cheque for ¬£999,999 for Francis cos he said he'd never pay ¬£1m for any player! Sounds about right for him! Wonder what he'd say about VAR!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidWoodydr @CharlieBunyan @FootballThen Yes, lovely player with them - never really fitted in with us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlieBunyan @FootballThen Not one of Ron's better decisions....but...yes UK record signing at the time! Think it was about a week later Trevor Francis was signed for Forest by Clough for ¬£1m!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 @glennthompson85 Exactly! It's not consistent! It's trial by tv, which is unfair!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glennthompson85 It's the result of the game being live in tv! If it hadn't be televised it wouldn't have been noticed! Sadly we don't have "a level playing field" now! Not doubting it deserved  punishment but its retrospect, based on live TV footage - most clubs don't face that! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@curious_kent Yes its frightening - the cost of items to/through the NHS is universally cheaper than it is to US patients - comparisons checked on internet for even some basic medicines is frightening!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie Quite - I need 7 prescription items a month &amp; ongoing treatment, without them both I wouldn't last long, but with them I lead a healthy, normal life. In US I'd be bankrupt or dead by now! Frightening really, isn't it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A medication I use (which I get free on the #NHS) costs, in UK, ¬£6.76 per item. In US, the same prescription from the same manufacturer, costs US citizens $79 per item! This is the reality of the difference in UK &amp; US medical care! Know when you're well off!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aversion therapy next perhaps? Worrying! #clockworkorange @Hepworthclare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies @AlbionOnSunday Agree - very negative approach from us, but Stoke did press high, closed down &amp; denied us a forward pass for much of the game so backwards seemed the only option!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wezzaboing74 @AlbionOnSunday Very true! We certainly shouldn't have let that one slip....realistically 2 more points there &amp; 2 more at Charlton, if we'd held on there too, &amp; we'd be 5 points ahead of Leeds &amp; there'd be few comments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlbionOnSunday "Good" teams aren't derailed by a setback but we seem over affected by Boro defeat &amp; haven't really recovered - playing with a swagger &amp; going forward has disappeared &amp; it's slow, sideways &amp; backwards now! Confidence is everything &amp; we need to recover that! Big test for Slav!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getpromotionpr @Surreybaggie Absolutely right on all points! Without moments of individual flair we offer very little creativity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor stuff! Fading fast! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie And against an international keeper we keep putting high crosses into 6 yard box!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie Exactly - squad needs fresh faces to give more options - lack of creativity tonight is very evident!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie @terrywoneill @Steve_Newman247 Not if it's a deflected bad shot! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Constantly trying to go through the middle of their defence isn't working - need to get in behind with more width! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Surreybaggie Absolutely right! We've been worked out by tactically aware managers! Close down our midfielders - job done! Slav needs to counter it with something different now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSock Swapping a cottage pie for a dogs dinner obviously not a good idea! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think if we keep it short &amp; on the ground we'll get something second half! Long &amp; high Stoke find too easy to defend! Be surprised if both side finish with 11 on pitch though - bit raw, some of the challenges! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A very good film - well worth a watch! Not the usual Kenneth More sort of movie. #TPTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllAlbion It was just the start of a fabulous few years - some really good signings round that time - Astle, Kaye, Clark, Fraser all joined in that era &amp; Bomber, Hope, Lovett come though from youths!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllAlbion Bobby Cram (right back) scoring a hat trick against them in 1965! Not many full backs have scored 3 in a game!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katie_monstah Not my day...worth a try! üòâüòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katie_monstah You buy me a bottle of ¬£30 malt whisky &amp; I'll buy you a bottle of ¬£20 vodka! Deal? ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katie_monstah You are absolutely right! I was looking for a discounted malt whisky at supermarket today &amp; there's sod all on offer! Before Christmas is was all heavily reduced! Sucks! üòâüëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett That's tough! Respect to you for still making the effort! But that ground is appallingly served by public transport since they don't expect anyone to drive there &amp; it's a cheap dump when you actually arrive!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tickets arrived for West Ham cup tie - now I have to face that miserable journey to that miserable stadium for my love of the #baggies - the things we do for #WBA!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@garwalbion @KentCricket He'd have played well over 100 tests if he hadn't joined the "Packer" rebels! Great bowler.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@garwalbion @KentCricket I've looked it up - it was last 4 wickets in 27 balls in last half hour to square series in 1968 after a heavy thunderstorm!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@garwalbion @KentCricket Yes - Deadly they called him for good reason - unplayable on some wickets! Remember him destroying Aussies in rain effected Test on last day! 68/69 ish! Play didn't start till about 4 &amp; he took last 5/6 wickets in 2 hours!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@garwalbion @KentCricket Quite possibly but Underwood usually didn't stay at the crease too long! üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Exactly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus I have had the feeling for some time that that was Johnson's bottom line all along! But, hey, isn't he funny, isn't he likeable, his bumbling stupidity is so endearing, so give him carte blanche to shaft us all! Mugs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Dogs dinner all of this, isn't it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wezzaboing74 @KentCricket Possibly! I remember Cowdrey &amp; Knott keeping the West Indies at bay all day in about 1968 but I'm struggling after that! Dates me a bit doesn't it - but I'm sure there have been occasions since the late 60's! #superkent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be interested to know if any cricket buff can tell me the last time two Kent batsmen were at the wicket together for England? @KentCricket #superkent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeaconPurple Happy Birthday Enjoy!   https://t.co/XU0RBLecvz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarah_WBAx @KathrynLangran Yep! Remarkable isn't it! Amazed it wasn't picked for tv, but thankful it wasn't! I'm definitely a big supporter of 3 on a Saturday!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarah_WBAx @KathrynLangran Cup tie, 3 o'clock on a Saturday, not on tv! There's a message in there somewhere!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Exactly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Lewis was my favoured option - I'm sad he isn't standing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Yes I think he'll win too - has the "statesman" about him but so much of what he is saying suggests he may be a poor man's Blair, which worries me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus To be honest its who I don't want in descending order....don't fancy any of those nominated! Not one that I see as "PM material" to the floating voters - which is who need convincing! Leading Labour &amp; leading country don't necessarily require the same skills!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@B_H_Baggie @Rusholmerufian1 @gemmadowneswba Yep - I do agree, we don't command the box in the air. Too often we don't see games out when we're on top - same at Barnsley! Late goals have cost us too many points! However we've also come from behind more times than anyone else so it does probably even out over a season!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B_H_Baggie @Rusholmerufian1 @gemmadowneswba Agree - I've never been a fan of zonal marking, too open/static with early balls in to box &amp; good movement by opposition forwards, which is what we keep getting caught with! But the home defeat to Boro still the only really poor result really! 3 points then we'd be 10 ahead!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 @gemmadowneswba Don't disagree Andy but drawing an away game doesn't need the doom &amp; gloom that some get into on here! We're still 7 points from 3rd! Not worth all the negativity! The only really bad result was losing to Boro imo. Need to beat Stoke though otherwise there will be cause to worry!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gemmadowneswba It's always all black or white for some isn't it! Never understand the terminal meltdown &amp; gloom when we don't always "perform!" Season is decided over 46 games - won't sweep teams away every week!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QuaysideW My pleasure üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QuaysideW Had some lovely food here when in #whitstable - really is good pub grub....&amp; homemade chips too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IronManRecords @John_Sinclair Great story - wasn't he also manager of MC5 - or is my memory playing tricks?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies That's the problem though - may be useful for rest of this season but not really a useful squad member at 33  if we go up &amp; little resale value at that age! I'm really not a fan of short term, stop gap signings! Now a loan might be worthy of consideration...?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett @wbalatest @SteveMadeley78 Hopefully! Not really a link to excite, is it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wbalatest I sincerely hope not! Another ageing striker will end up like most (not all!) of the rest we've signed over the years! Short term fix, probably doomed to failure!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ronstanding @Morrisons Quite! And yet they try to promote themselves as being such! In fairness, I've had proper "fishmongery" there in past but think the person this morning was just a "stand in!" Annoying though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @Morrisons My grandmother used to love bloaters, which are (I think) herrings "kippered" with the guts in...thing is, they usually made her ill - hence I'm guts out with everything!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @Morrisons Prefer them "without!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most frustrating tweets  - those people who tweet "I saw (add name of well known person) trending &amp; feared the worst..phew..they aren't actually dead just... (picking nose,  scratching bum etc)!" Check before you tweet! Mutter mutter!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sadly this morning Kidderminster @Morrisons "fishmonger" didn't know how to gut sardines! Poor!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mojorisin94 Good plan! üëçüòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mojorisin94 When you see who the MSM are "talking up" amongst the candidates, you know who you don't want elected! The agenda continues unabated - attempted manipulation by the establishment to influence will not end!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShaneoTheBaggie @phildeeley77 @DarrenGuest7 He's 16 ffs! He isn't legally allowed to make his own decisions yet/sign contracts, they are being made on his behalf based on the self interest of those making them &amp; the number of 16yo that have played in first team in last 50 years is about 2! This isn't worth stressing over!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now 7 round the wicket to the spinner! Love to see it! #SAvsENG<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cadders10 @LHatfield_Star I don't think Barca are the ones ripping anyone off really when Barry (or his parents) will be the ones who made the real money moving when he did! The inducement for him to move will have life changing for his family! That's the real issue!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Its completely irrational &amp; I don't know why, but I've always had a soft spot for Rochdale! Never been to Spotlands.. but so happy for them equalising... they deserve it! #rocNew<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray As I've said earlier, it isn't about selecting someone who "suits Labour members" - its about picking someone the wider electorate would vote for - most candidates suit some members but don't tick the wider box.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett Starmer leads for me at moment but we'll see - agree though...he's very "home counties!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett Agree about Phillips &amp; think a new leader is about looking to "Joe public" (not just members) that they are a potential PM. Rules most out really doesn't it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some Labour leadership candidates calling for unity now would do well to remember that if they had offered internal unity in last few years they might have been in government now instead of trying to come back from the wilderness! "As ye sow...!" &amp; all that! #LabourLeadership<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaggiesRoger Wasn't it an early kick off too? Remember standing on a freezing terrace &amp; losing a game we were really expected to win! Typical Baggies!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@huntywbafc Yes - suspect to high balls into box too &amp; we didn't really exploit it enough!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DickLaurent96 Yes, I agree. Last night we did ok but Leeds football was better! Up there we were stunning &amp; got absolutely nothing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robbiestatto Yes - fair comment!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reflection on last night...think we played better at Leeds &amp; lost, so take the draw yesterday - but they are a decent side &amp; if we both go up justice done! Still work to do for both of us yet though! #WBA #LeedsUnited<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DD1958 @gawdyhall @people_paul Used to like their bread but stopped buying it when I found out they were #Tory #supporters #warburtons<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So regular "exams" for Civil Servants to prove their competency? How about regular exams for Ministers to prove theirs? I know who'd come out on top every time! #exams #CivilService<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus You have a good one too Steve! I do have a special malt lined up - had Glenmorangie Astar for Christmas - wonderful choice - tried a wee dram the other evening - its nectar! More tonight!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus I hadn't seen it but jeeeesssuuusss that's shocking! Makes you question a lot of things....!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never seen this before - not sure why! "The Magic Box" with the wonderful Robert Donat &amp; cameo performances by everyone who was anyone in British 50's cinema! Saved it off @TalkingPicsTV  - glad I did!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baggiedave70 @huntywbafc @barryd19651 @boingboinger Agree - we're too pedestrian up front - playing one up we need pace &amp; CA is a bit slow &amp; HRK not central striker- but we won't spend ¬£15/20m on Gayle!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baggiedave70 @huntywbafc @barryd19651 @boingboinger Exactly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baggiedave70 @huntywbafc @barryd19651 @boingboinger But we have to buy him for a lot of money &amp; he's 30 &amp; won't hack it in PL if we go up! Dead money wasted!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@huntywbafc @barryd19651 @boingboinger Don't want Gayle - he's history! Need to look forward, not back!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getpromotionpr Yes agree - it is a big test! We've been a bit "off the boil" since Swansea game really! Bound to have a blip or two in a season but it's how we respond that matters!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getmeabiscuit Decent side with a good manager - it's all come together for them because of ambitious owners! The test will come when Nuno goes - eventually I'm sure one of the "big boys" in Europe will poach him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Losing the unbeaten home record could be a blessing in the long run! Pressure of keeping it going now is removed &amp; can "just play" again! Leeds could feel the backlash on Wednesday - be typically Albion to bounce back with a bang! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StigsWBACousin Ah the Sports Argus...used to buy a copy at the bottom of New St ramp on the way out on Saturday night! A match report that actually "reported" what had happened, not just quote what the manager said! Tonight would have been reflective over a pint....or several!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephen_cox_B62 @daiseyrai Stay there! This is an absolute shambles here!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RayMilo1 @philmcnulty Perhaps if offside was judged on where a players feet actually were, rather than the most forward part of his body, it would solve a lot of the issues!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is truly ridiculous! He's leaning forward ffs - his feet were behind the feet of the defender! If VAR continues like this football is gone! It was a fine goal! #NORTOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adriansewell53 Fat lady hasn't sung yet Adrian! ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ronstanding Good question - I think some of the lower teams raise their games quite a bit sometimes &amp; the difference between top &amp; bottom isn't as wide as some think, but some of our overall "team" performances have been impressive, so I don't think it's just down to individual moments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bruges1878 Absolutely - late goal was a sod but objectively Barnsley deserved it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@magneticsparrow Don't disagree - but if someone had said we'd be top at Christmas with just one defeat, I'd have laughed at them - so a few poor performances don't bother me too much at the moment! Happy days!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett Agree with all that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@magneticsparrow Thought we looked "knackered" &amp; when we don't play our best 11 we do fall short, like at Wigan, but that wasn't a bad point considering! We'd have lost in previous years!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett Agree totally! Barnsley are an improving side &amp; will survive this season - thought they were excellent  but we do look a bit "weary!" Think our squad is still a bit "thin" on quality back up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having slept on it....I don't think we played badly yesterday...we just didn't play well...there is a difference! But a point away is better than nothing! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HilaryBoing1 Do they? Theres hope yet then! I'll leave a note by the chimney for Santa when I go to bed - that should fix it! üòÇüëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie Lol - too complicated for the modern generation! Weren't we advanced for our age then!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie Yes - when I lost interest in Rupert I progressed to Eagle! Kids today don't know what they missed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie Do you know what? I remember that too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It must be over 60 years since anyone bought me a Rupert Annual for Christmas - I'm not expecting to see that change tomorrow! Hey-ho!  #ChristmasEve<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B_H_Baggie Same to you - have a good one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martincroom Good to hear - your family deserves some good news. Hope you all have the best Christmas possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Sums everything up very well doesn't  it! Merry Xmas to you &amp; yours too,  Steve &amp; have a dram or two &amp; a tot of anything else you fancy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Lol - very true!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gemmabaggies It was very moving Gemma - you must have been so proud. The #albionfamily are very special when it comes to supporting their own! Onwards &amp; upwards. #WBA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chrislepkowski Yes - not sure that he &amp; Everton will be a good fit....they don't hang about much when telling managers to pack!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@romerlyn My point was really that a woman needs to win the leadership in an open competition, not one where there are no male candidates! Thatcher &amp; May were elected against male competitors, so was Sturgeon! An all women selection does women no favours! Caroline Lucas?  Yes absolutely!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislepkowski Lol - no doubt he'll get 50% off his contract for some reason or another!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lazydave68 Lol - yes I thought you were local which was why I asked!  If it was going to take 10 hours to get to the Hawthorns from Halesowen would mean I need to leave now from Kiddie! Work explains it...! ü§£ü§£ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lazydave68 Where are you travelling from?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 Absolutely Andy!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Gemmabaggies All strength to you and your family today Gemma. Love to you all x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martincroom @mrianthomas @Gemmabaggies I'm with your family today in spirit, Martin. Together you will provide each other the collective strength to get you through a difficult day. Love to you all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulinegrayva Yes, I was so pleased to see it's still there! My family (the Cheshire half) are from Northwich/Hartford &amp; we always spent a week at my grandmother's over Christmas when I was a kid! Bratts, &amp; lunch there, was a regular Christmas shopping treat!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray Absolutely - used to go up there every year when school broke up before Christmas &amp; stay until after Boxing Day! It was 'Christmas' for years! Bratts was/is a wonderful department store, the sort that have almost gone, that had a great restaurant too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Many" years ago, my grandmother always took me Christmas shopping to #Bratts in #Northwich - just found out they're still there! Wonderful! All is not lost! Lunch there used to be memorable for a 8 year old! Is it still I wonder?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daiseyrai I'm not asleep, just resting my eyes....!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@romerlyn And there's several women I'd support as leader &amp; several men too! Also some I wouldn't, but my choice is purely based on suitably, not their gender!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@romerlyn Don't dispute that Ron, but just think the suggestion "next Labour leader needs to be a woman cos we've never had one" misses the point a bit! Party leader should be the best person available, be that man or woman, gender isn't a selection criteria!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gemmabaggies Have a lovely day &amp; I've added this... üëá - I've put on twitter before but it's worth repeating - true words that sum up so much. üòä  https://t.co/DDWalGEDFP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Marian__Kennedy @AmateurFOI Absolutely right Marian! My point exactly! The best person is the best person &amp; to define the selection by gender is not equality &amp; distorts the whole process.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uber_foods Good point!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke @sedgey1964 My fear too! Get the nasty stuff in quickly whilst the majority is big then soften a bit a year or so before the next election to secure another term!  Tried &amp; tested strategy they've used before! Next couple of years will be the acid test! Not looking forward to it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sedgey1964 @BearwoodBloke Lol - yes I understood!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sedgey1964 @BearwoodBloke I think Johnson lurching to the left is about as likely as Dracula giving up blood! He isn't going to soften his position! The Tories are way to the right of where they were under Major &amp; I don't see that changing - the power in the party won't let Johnson move more to centre.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke @sedgey1964 There isn't an obvious natural leader really but I'd probably go for Starmer as the right interim "caretaker" for a few years to let some of the younger talent develop. Also got a sneaking regard for Angela Rayner but probably a bit too soon for her yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mr_dead_2012 @AngelaRayner Yes I like her too very much but I'm thinking she may not be seem as PM material by "floaters"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke Not for me I'm afraid. Mind you I'm struggling...don't rate most of those whose names are being mentioned!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShaneoTheBaggie He'd be ok with me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 I don't back Tories - Corbyn, if he'd been PM, wouldn't have lead Labour into next election, he'd have been too old, so it was a transient choice! But the shitstorm we're now facing with a nasty piece of work running a hard right, fascist leaning, government is not a nice option!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 As they are in half of Europe! Public services in public ownership for public good - not for profit to line the pockets of shareholders!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 - this üëá  https://t.co/yeKSiG2vT3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 That wasnt what was being suggested! However mass control of the media by the state is fascism as perfected by Nazi Germany, which is what we currently have!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 They weren't "extreme left" unless you're hard right! The manifesto was main stream democratic socialism if you look across Europe where they have left leaning government!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Saw an ex miner in NE say he'd been Labour for 70 years but voted Tory to get out of EU &amp; "Boris would save NHS!" Reporter said "so you're a Tory now?" "Not really, I'm solid Labour!" was his reply! Its totally brain dead!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie He may hold sway in his union but I don't thin he has much influence over 500k+ party members.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Yep - sad isn't it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray Perhaps because the best option won? I find it incredibly patronising to women that some think men should be removed from the equation so women can win! Most women I know think that too - they want to "win" in equal competition with men, not because men aren't an option.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chefdeals Quite!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@griffraces Exactly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BilliardsCue When I know who my opinions are! üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BilliardsCue I'll see what the options are when the choices declare &amp; when the process starts! Called keeping an open mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BilliardsCue Oh dear! Are any names in the frame yet? I'm speaking about a principle of an open selection based on suitable options - not specific individuals! You seem to have already made up you mind judging by your "handle!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenWFLabour Exactly - a woman leader would be nice but has to be the best option in an open choice, not one that excludes half the candidates because they're male!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rcc217W Quite!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BilliardsCue Not if the best person available in the choice is male! What does gender have to do with it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rcc217W Absolutely my point! It annoys me intensely when some say its "the turn of a woman" to be leader!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BilliardsCue Exactly my point! But some are saying next leader should be a woman because we've never had one! Patronising &amp; insulting to women in my opinion since women  are good enough to win on merit without excluding men!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Am I alone in thinking the next Labour leader should be the "best person" for the job, irrespective of gender? We're selecting a potential PM, not pandering to selection based on sex because we've never had a woman leader! Best should win, male or female! #LabourLeadership<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@phoenixbaggie @IanMoore333 Wouldn't want to see you if we were 4 nil down! üòú<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rjdowning Yep - didn't see us getting back in it at 2-1 down!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Well I think it's fair to say Bilic's unforced subs worked again! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveBSmith None of that was the point I was making though! Hodge is solid anti Corbyn &amp; has slagged him off since day one! My point was about the BBC continuing, after the election, to promote an anti Labour agenda by interviewing those who promote it! It was Hoey on the previous one I saw!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's special! #Austin #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor - free header again but keeper should have had that! #WBA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus De'feet'ed .....ü§£üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Absolutely - in politics, if you don't back, or reflect, what people want, they shaft you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wbaxjack Just think Slav prefers to start Ferguson on right rather than left! Don't think Furlong's done anything wrong really - just can't fit 'em all in! ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darr3nHall The licence fee isn't really the problem though, it's how the BBC appoint those in top posts that sets the agenda! Pay by subscription like Sky is fine but Sky are also driven by their owner's interests! The media isn't "free" in any sense of the word!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Want an objective assessment? Wheel out Margaret Hodge to twist the knife a bit more! No #BBCBias against Labour? Yeah right! The world is flat! #bbcbreakfast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Just do a Rhodesia &amp; declare UDI! Use Johnson's mantra - "just get it done!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Careful....or Johnson will send The Duke of Cumberland to sort you out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Lol - I've been told I should have kept it in my "genes" more that once!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Swinson going pleased me - really didn't like her. Also my birth constituency (Canterbury) stayed Labour with an increased majority! It was never anything but Tory till last election! Remarkable! Whisper it, but my grandad was Tory Party club treasurer there in the 40's/50's!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus I expect to lose - don't always put it in public domain though - but it was a question of by how much. Hoped for another hung parliament &amp; thought that was the likely outcome based on what I was hearing yesterday! The "exit" poll was a sickener!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus The political naivety of too many people who voted for Johnson 'cos he's funny' sums up the English decision making! They'll soon learn when they see the reality of Brexit! Can't help thinking a good result for Labour in England would have helped Scotland in the long run.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett Blair had the support of Murdoch, et al for two elections! When it was withdrawn for Brown, Labour lost again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett I don't agree - many of the negative issues, allegedly, aimed at Labour, were overplayed &amp; actively promoted by the BBC &amp; right wing press! There were as many negative issues with the Tories ( Islamophobia, racism etc) that were minimised &amp; ignored - "oh it Boris isn't he funny!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett There were issues within party,Brendan, but the constantly negative spin from the media added to it! Watching BBC now, it's over and they're still on the attack! The long term losers aren't Labour, the long term losers at the millions in UK who needed a change of government!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jeeeesssusss! I turned the tv off at 9am &amp; just turned it on again to see the same people analysing the same points, ad infinitum, 5hrs later! It's over, it is what it is - move on! #GeneralElection #BBCElection<|endoftext|>

My Grandad was "true blue" but my dad was a socialist - it was fun as a kid (!) -  but my dad dreamt of a Labour MP representing the area! He never saw it, but I have! Thank you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 Yes - I think he felt the need to rest a few key players with the heavy fixture list in next few weeks! Personally I'd have played Grady first half &amp; Pereira second, wouldn't have started without both - needed their "flair!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We were 10 pts clear of 3rd place before last night, we're 11 pts clear now! No harm done! We'll have off days &amp; last night was poor but its Saturday that matter now! Move on. #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Yes - isn't it awful! And apologists for the media still try to claim it isn't biased &amp; "in bed" with Tories! Corrupt!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LizJRudd ü§£ü•≥üëç - will you be in grey?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 @LiamWBAFC @ShaneoTheBaggie Neither is justified - racism is racism  &amp; abominable however, or by whoever,  it is delivered! But look which Labour MP's left &amp; their affiliation mostly to Labour Friends of Israel &amp; question the real agenda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WestBromEL That was my understanding but I haven't used it this season, I did last, but just checking so I didn't get excited in expectation for nothing! ü§£üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Presuming the #baggies game is on the Sky "red button" tonight since I couldn't make the trip to Wigan? Can anyone confirm that? #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiamWBAFC @Rusholmerufian1 @ShaneoTheBaggie Anyone can refer an issue to them - you need to see what their judgement/findings are before you presume the outcome! Personally I think someone should refer the Tories to them for their Islamophobia. Johnson's racist comments are disgraceful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 @ShaneoTheBaggie *manufactured*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 @ShaneoTheBaggie Disagree totally - it's being engineered by those who don't like his support for Palestine - the Zionist lobby, many of whom aren't even Jewish! The Zionist lobby in Tory party is strong. There is also a strong anti Zionist Jewish lobby who will tell you its manufacturers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_DaveFleming @Rusholmerufian1 Quite - about 400 constituencies have no chance of change. The election will be decided by a handful of marginal seats changing hands<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiamWBAFC @Rusholmerufian1 @ShaneoTheBaggie Thing is there are Jews of both the "left" &amp; "right" political view &amp; it's the "right" &amp; strong supporters of Israel who have promoted this! Anti Israel Jews, of whom there are many, see no antisemitism! Being against the Israeli govt isn't anti Jewish!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 @ShaneoTheBaggie No because I don't think he is the cause of antisemitism &amp; I certainly don't think Labour,as a party, is racist - when I was a student in the 60's (Arab - Israeli war time) I recall much worse anti Jewish attitudes in some really hard left students than anything now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShaneoTheBaggie @Rusholmerufian1 Mind you, doesn't really matter who I vote for since where I live its almost certainly going to stay Tory.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShaneoTheBaggie @Rusholmerufian1 I take the view party before individual, so its Labour for me, since I worry too much of what the Tories offer is not in best interests of most of us! Leaders come &amp; go &amp; Corbyn will probably stand down in year or two since he'll be too old to lead Labour into next election<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 Been very nasty Andy! Poor choices all round really &amp; the debate has been more about individuals than the real issues. Never known an election like it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Does she really - that's appalling!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Yes - it's a personal thing for me, I think she's insincere! Says what she thinks people want to hear!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Wouldn't trust LibDems if my life depended on it! Wouldn't throw Swinson a life belt if she was drowning! Really don't like her!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus I'm increasingly of the opinion it'll be another hung parliament - week ago I'd have said overall Tory majority but there's a shift going on against Tories imho! We'll soon know!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus We've had 2 so far from Labour &amp; none from anyone else....and this is a nailed on, safe Tory seat! The Tory arrogance is stunning!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getpromotionpr Quite - I used "intellectual" more as a sarcastic comment than a serious observation!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just heard on radio. "Can't vote Labour cos Corbyn is too far left, but I do like Labour policies best! But I'll vote for Boris, he's likeable, even though I don't believe anything he says!" The intellectual level of decision making that decides our future! #GeneralElection2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can you have a balanced political debate when those answering the questions are BBC "experts" giving their "take" on how they interpret party policies? Farcical! #Crewe #bbcbreakfast<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm speechless....but in a good way!#wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnson playing footie, Corbyn cooking, Swinson playing tennis &amp; Sturgeon skating - nearly a full house of 'acceptable' pursuits on tv for leaders so far! Just need one now of Farage having a pint &amp; a fag to complete the set! üòÇ #partytime #GeneralElection19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett Yes - final nail in his coffin! Probably the worst Baggies performance of his entire tenure - absolutely no ambition against awful opponents!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #hudlee &amp; all I can think about is the awesome pie I had last time I visited there with #WBA! #priorities! Mind you, Pulis was still #baggies manager then, so there wasn't much to get excited about!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yesssssss! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stop trying to walk it in ffs! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesWilkoWBA Is he wearing a "half &amp; half" scarf too? Sad!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@phoenixbaggie Was it? Either way it didn't effect the keeper saving it! Technically that is a retake but without VAR doubt the ref would have spotted it cos he'd have been watching keeper!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rcc217W Yes I agree completely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rcc217W No of course not! But technically if there was an infringement, it should!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett Exactly Brendan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>VAR is killing PL football for me! Marginal decisions &amp; mistakes by refs are part of the game! If a keeper saves a penalty because he's 6 inches off his line, good luck to him! A top striker shouldn't miss from 12 yds! #NORARS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Conservatives #horse #doors #bolted #after #close #rearrange #wellknownphraseorsaying #Tories #donkeys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 I believe a sentence is a sentence &amp; UK law currently allows for a minimum part of a sentence to be served  then an offender to be considered for release if judged safe to do so! That is the law. I support the law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 There was a programme of deradicalisation for convicted terrorists whilst in prison which was given to many who were later released. This guy asked to go on it because he was scared he'd reoffend. Tory cuts in the prison service funding meant he was denied that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 You'll have to ask Corbyn to define his response for you if it's too difficult for you to understand! It was perfectly clear how he meant it to me! And if you give a terrorist 15 years &amp; let them out early or let them out after 15, is the risk of reoffending removed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 Spin it how you want - he said it "depends on the circumstances..." &amp; a lot of other issues - every case on it merits! Which is perfectly reasonable!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 And Tory Home Secretary was the the person who released the Friday killer!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 He hasn't said that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@griffraces Appalling isn't it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnson you are talking bollocks with this as every lawyer will confirm! Totally disingenuous to politicise Friday's events &amp; basically #Marr is letting him get away with it! Nasty party leader in full flow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Baggie fans travelling to PNE Monday see this... I'm sure we'll all join in the applause. #WBA @eva_jeens<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@m1tch23 Lol - seriously Grady is appalling you really don't want him back.....ever! üòú<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus I think its somewhere near Colchester...but maybe the raspberries in their jam come from Scotland...so there is a possible link!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Tiptree? You've got jam on it! Count your blessings.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bedicted_mn I'm wondering how long before his battery runs out.....! #BBCDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You start to think the #LabourParty don't really need to campaign in #GE2019 because @BorisJohnson not turning up to anything &amp; #StanleyJohnson appearing instead is all the campaigning they need - two peas from the same pod! Nasty to a fault, both of them! #JohnsonTheCoward<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnson senior in extended interview on #bbcbreakfast "I'm just an ordinary citizen....!" So are millions of us Stan, but we don't get invited onto tv to say what we think!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Absolutely agree - its yahboo stuff of the lowest order driven by the media! Make Johnson out to be Mr Loveable when he's totally incompetent &amp; only throw out negativity, smears &amp; lies about everyone else! The country is being played for mugs &amp; millions buy it! Nasty stuff!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bartlebee24_ @TheVan @mark_rollason @WanchopePaulo @TheBoingCast That's the point of the debate though isn't it! If he's driven by his ambition as a footballer then he makes that choice about who he wants to play for! But this all started about taking the money &amp; getting rich, if offered the choice, even if it stalled or destroyed his career.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVan @bartlebee24_ @mark_rollason @WanchopePaulo @TheBoingCast And have been unemployed now! They ceased trading in 2008! Bad decisions destroyed them! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bartlebee24_ @TheVan @mark_rollason @WanchopePaulo @TheBoingCast I think it all depends on what motivates you! Satisfaction &amp; fulfillment was always more important to me than personal wealth! I turned down opportunities for more money because I preferred to do what I liked doing! We aren't all mercenary &amp; materialistic! Don't presume!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVan @mark_rollason @WanchopePaulo @TheBoingCast That's my point! He'll probably get rich beyond what 99% of us will ever achieve in a lifetime whether it's at 20 or 35! Does it really matter if the offer doesn't come in again if football is what you really want to play before the money!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mark_rollason @WanchopePaulo @TheVan @TheBoingCast Well yes - those who take a cut, parents or agents - not sure that many of the youngsters get the right advice or are "cute" enough to realise they are, sometimes, being used.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WanchopePaulo @mark_rollason @TheVan @TheBoingCast Yes - I think your reflection about agents really hits the nail on the head!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray @LukePollard I've followed Luke for some time Steven - he has proved himself to be a credit to those he represents in Plymouth &amp; this respect for Nancy Astor at this time is typical of the man!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mark_rollason @WanchopePaulo @TheVan @TheBoingCast You miss my point! Is playing football what's important or getting rich quick &amp; festering in a u23 squad! I'd want to play at the highest level &amp; wealth would be the result, not the reason! If its getting rich &amp; football is just the vehicle, then its mercenary!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WanchopePaulo @TheVan @mark_rollason @TheBoingCast But for every Izzy there are many who don't fulfill their promise &amp; never make it! No risk staying at Baggies &amp; developing in first team for another 2/3 years, playing regularly then at 22/23 moving - or Chelsea reserves now &amp; on loan at Rochdale (no disrespect to Rochdale!)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mark_rollason @WanchopePaulo @TheVan @TheBoingCast Quite - and the really young prospects we've lost have been "bought" by offers to parents who are the ones who take the cut before the kids are legally old enough to sign contracts!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WanchopePaulo @TheVan @mark_rollason @TheBoingCast But does he want to play football or get rich? Out on loan, unsure future, could have made a lot of money anyway being first choice by now at Baggies! Rich at 20 or rich when you retire at 30+ - the outcome for the future is the same!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mark_rollason @WanchopePaulo @TheVan @TheBoingCast Agree that's probably right but don't think this is the right time for him now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mark_rollason @TheVan @WanchopePaulo @TheBoingCast You presume it should all be about money - what a sad indictment of modern football! He's no age yet - has years to cash in if he continues to develop! Albion first team now or "a big club" back up with no game time in first team! Possibly PL next season if he stays!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mark_rollason @TheVan @WanchopePaulo @TheBoingCast Also take the view he probably has an agent who is playing hard ball to see who is interested &amp; what is on offer from all involved parties - not convinced Ferguson is master of his own destiny in this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshesVictory 53/54 then! That team was so good it was dubbed the Team of the Century by the press! I never saw it in its prime but saw it few seasons later when it was breaking up - too young then to appreciate it though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been a Baggie for more years than most, but I don't ever remember us going into December before unbeaten at home! We are witnessing something special this season! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCNewsPR @afneil Are the "ongoing discussions" about whether or not he will wear an ear piece?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theMattachines @BBCNewsPR @afneil Subject to still being an MP of course! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @DylanStrain @Peston Except this isn't party spin - its media spin - which is much more insidious that what some politician says &amp; suggests a coordinated agenda!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffreyMorris3 Yes - if it isn't done in a similar style it will be very noticeable...and answer a lot of questions!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DylanStrain @Peston I'm firmly of the view the Chief Rabbi's "artlcle" in The Times was released to be timed the same day Corbyn was due to appear on tv so Neill could attack him on it! Complicity, &amp; stage managed smears, by the media suggest bigger forces in action, which is very worrying!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisjdownes Yes - that's the acid test isn't it! Can't see that Johnson would have agreed to interview if there wasn't some sort of agreed "understanding!" We'll see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Surreybaggie Well yes.....! But it may not happen if he interviews Farage first in the same manner as the two so far &amp; Nige lamps him! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IN4JC @jeremycorbyn Worth remembering Neil was a Tory Party member &amp; Chair of the Federation of Conservative Students when he was at Uni - so no likely bias or agenda there then!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Surreybaggie Which day is "yeah but, no but" Johnson on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray I can't see Swinson doing very well either! If he uses the same "attack dog" approach, she'll be a mess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sbaggieboy60 I sincerely hope so but we'll see!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenWFLabour I'd take a bet now it's a "friendly chat" with Johnson that we get!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sbaggieboy60 Be interested to see if that applies to all 5! Somehow think it won't!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVan They aren't really question though are they! Its figures thrown about &amp; interruptions before he ends a sentence! Same last night - Neil just wants to attack - it isn't forensic questioning, which it should be! Sturgeon got the same treatment- devalues the point of programme.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The point of an interview is to ask a question &amp; hear the answer, then scrutinise it! Neil is just aggressive &amp; hectoring, as he was with Sturgeon last night! It devalues the "debate" to pointless! Poor. #AndrewNeil<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Lol - the world is full of prats who are elected by even bigger prats! It isn't the system that's broken but the "thick" who vote that cause it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@russellpinnock2 @sicoop01 Yes - what the media chooses to "make an issue" is very selective!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruth_wishart @HelenArmet Sadly the quality of political interviews is now appalling! Ask a question then confrontationally interrupt the answer! It's about the interviewer trying to look "good!" Oh for Robin Day - ask the question, listen to answer, then put the knife in with the "supplementary!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor stuff from Heseltine there - a man for whom I once had grudging respect - clearly well past his sell by date now! Men in white coats were probably just off camera? #BBCBreakfast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gemmabaggies Take strength from the love &amp; support the 3 of you receive from those that you have touched on here with your strength &amp; fortitude. You are a wonderful family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sicoop01 Quite - the "don't like Corbyn" mantra, in most cases is because of what people have been subjected to for over 3 years of negative (mostly untrue) stories across the media! If they're gullible enough to believe it, they're foolish enough to vote Tory! Turkeys/Christmas!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NigelGilbert4 Yep - thing is the line they're taking is quite reasonable - letting the country decide though a second referendum- but the media spinning it with "what does that mean - we don't understand" when they clearly do, has got into people's heads as being a weakness! Very gullible!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie Bit like those that elected Johnson as Tory leader then!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie Well the person quoted was as thick as mince so that probably explains their rationale!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 You're a lost cause already.....! üòú<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I've heard a lot of people say they're not voting Labour this time!" Quote on #bbcbreakfast! So if you don't #VoteLabourDecember12 you get Tory again - is that what you really want?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebritton68 @gully_burrows @TomLondon6 Just a sentence in prison for him would do for me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett Absolutely - central midfield wasn't quite right but no harm done! In recent seasons we'd have lost that! Fact we didn't is testament to how far we've progressed under Slaven!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The result was we won - sometimes how you arrive there isn't always the most important thing! Poor performance overall but good teams win games like that! On to Wednesday! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Quite!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Frightening isn't it that if Tories win most seats but not a majority &amp;  need support to form a government , it could include both Johnson &amp; Swinson! Both are a bad case of ego over ability!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Be interested to hear your opinion on Swinson &amp; Johnson when you've seen it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus She and Corbyn were the two that made a positive contribution in my opinion! It was an absolute car crash for the other two who seemed more intent on negativity about others than anything positive they might do!    A huge attempt to "level it out" by media today!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Scandalous isn't it - I watched the whole debate last night &amp; the "news" coverage today could have been at a different event! The media is being manipulated/controlled by nasty forces!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray @_handinglove I think the problem is, it's the way media spin selective "sound bites" that don't give the full story! Last night showed them all "raw &amp; uncut" - it worked for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_handinglove @histevegray I'm with you. I thought Swinson couldn't hack the cross examination &amp; was close to tears at one point! Johnson could be accused of "telling fibs" with every statement he made &amp; was incoherent most of the time! Anyone with an open mind should have learnt at lot!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray @_handinglove All depends if people have an open mind or not! Most probably don't!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gemmabaggies @WBA Perhaps Harrison could play instead of Jake or Romaine today! He seems to have the magic touch so wouldn't let us down! üòâü§£. Really hope you both have a wonderful day Gemma.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 Absolutely  - she's having a stinker!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>400+ seats will be won by Tory/Labour/SNP by default since that many are "safe" seats &amp; won't change! So if LibDems win the rest, which they wont, Swinson still couldn't be PM! No credibility at all! #Swinson #bbcqt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray @jemclay Yes I understand that but if I remember right all those in the Star Chamber were also Privy Councillors  at the time - anyway it was sarcasm on my part, not really an intellectual observation!

<|startoftext|>@jemclay @histevegray Lol - wouldn't call any of them a "star" but if I remember my history right the "Star Chamber" was made up of Privy Councillors in government so they all do qualify!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jemclay @histevegray I'll precis it for you "the Tory government!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 Should prove interesting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getpromotionpr Open at the page with Lord Snooty on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the bloke sitting next to me has two morning papers....the S*n &amp; the Mail... won't be getting into conversation with him! #braindead<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Stephen888WTF @CNDuk @joswinson Yep - sums up my views perfectly! I've had respect for many LibDems in the past but none at all for this person!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@julesbrown12 Can see it. üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't think people "laughing" last  night is really significant or surprising is it? Obviously Labour supporters in audience laughed at Johnson &amp; Tory supporters laughed at Corbyn! Par for the course! #LeadersDebate #bbcbreakfast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 Spot on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie @PeterBone1 Lol - format not substance!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 Ah Robin Day....now he'd have been great in that situation!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie We agree! üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 Quite - no one can say what they want on some major topics in short bursts! Also chairing was poor! No scrutiny of replies - that's where the searching gets done &amp; their position dissected! Cross examination needed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett Quite - it isn't a debate! It's very "tabloid" - not allowing any depth to any answer!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sadly, the worst thing about this is the format! Ruining it for me! 30 second sound bites then closed is hardly fair to either of them! And now we get a commercial break! #ITVDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yea but.... no but..... ! #ITVdebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ronstanding Well Portugal for starters! And Labour isn't hard left - unless you read the Mail or Sun! Its Democratic Socialist - which is a totally different animal!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_handinglove Absolutely right! The democratic weakness isn't the system but voters!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I find it remarkable &amp; inexplicable that so many who are "working class" say #Labour isn't for them any more, but they'll accept a Tory government instead as the only alternative! Tories ain't on your side guys - think it through! #VoteLabourDecember12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheWatts22 Because I "dont give a toss" about having it thrust at me 24 hours a day on tv, radio &amp; media generally! It's not the issue, it's the saturation &amp; repetitive coverage! You completely missed the point!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheWatts22 Do you not question why this has "broken" now - two weeks into an election campaign where there are significant questions about a report  about Russian involvement in UK politics that's being covered up or Johnson implicated in financial corruption in his relationships? Timing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheWatts22 It is not worth the oxygen it's being given &amp; until its proved, one way or the other, allegation is all it is! News is fact, not speculation! I'm more concerned about Britain selling arms to Saudi Arabia, who affect millions of lives in Yemen with them than who Andrew slept with!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheWatts22 Not really - its being spun to deflect the news from Russian involvement/manipulation in British politics &amp; corruption in Brexit referendum plus Johnson shagging everything that moves, who is also is a corrupt liar &amp; is our PM! Timing is perfect to play the voters! Priorities!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you know what - I don't really give a toss what Prince Andrew got up to, or didn't! I'm more concerned about who is going to lead this country &amp; why, in next 5 years! That's being marginalised - I wonder why? #GeneralElection19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Think they call that a sandwich course......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wezzaboing74 Yes, his voice was perfect for it! Saw the "farewell tour" at NEC a few years ago - with Jason Donovan! Stunning concert! They used Burton's voice from the album &amp; getting put out at about 100000 watts it was very atmospheric! Didn't  think this tonight worked - lacked something!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray Yes very disappointing wasn't it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@m28246491 @OldNeptune @DonnaMatton Wonderful photo - catches the Neppy character perfectly! Making me home sick....!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I'd have started this with a voice over of the first few paragraphs of the book - very evocative words that set the tone perfectly! But what do I know.... #waroftheworlds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus I did painting by numbers once.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Apparently they do - saw a piece on tv about them. I'd need more than a shed to develop any new skills with my inability to do anything remotely constructive with my hands, though I could do the socialising bit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wurly1956 I think the original referendum showed a similar lack of leadership too then by your measurement didn't it? Asking the people what they want to determine the direction the country takes?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Ha ha - don't think it's too far from the truth!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie Nor have I!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie Not really the point is it? Missed it by a mile! You told me you were a remainer &amp; didn't want Johnson as party leader! Now #Corbyn offers a democratic resolution, so you revert to type, decry it &amp; by default, accept Johnson's shocking stitch up deal!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie Plus Johnson has got all Tory candidates to sign a commitment to endorse his #Brexit deal if elected - so a vote Tory is a vote #leave! No democracy there for all the Tories who support EU membership - there are many!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie And I certainly won't be voting in GE for who may or may not deliver #brexit! Single issue of that is irrelevant compared to 1001 other more important issues that need addressing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie Why do they need to know specifically? It's a clear &amp; unequivocal statement of "we'll negotiate a best option leave - offer it to you with a rejection for remain. You tell us which you prefer &amp; we'll deliver it!" People before party - fine by me! Brexit was never a party issue!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thought #marr consistently chasing a commitment, one way or other, from #Corbyn, was poor journalism! For senior politician to say "I wont impose my views, I'll let the people choose when they have all the facts &amp; options available, then I'll deliver it" is the way it should be!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVan @AubreyMilkshake Agree - but worth the leap....safe investment!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVan @AubreyMilkshake We completed the Hegazi deal in January instead of waiting till end of season - what was that? ¬£4m?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVan @AubreyMilkshake Read something a couple of weeks ago that his parent club are keen to complete cos they're desperate for funds to strengthen squad &amp; he's agreed personal terms with us, so getting it done could be achieved quickly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVan @AubreyMilkshake No brainer isn't it! Sign him in January for the agreed fee &amp; if/when "big boys" want him we make a big fat profit! His value will only go up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ronstanding And profits they make doesn't aid taxpayer or treasury - it benefits shareholders! Since BT privatised in 1985 paid shareholders ¬£54bn in dividends! Now capitalists that own it are moaning Labour want to fund broadband at ¬£20m. It could've already been done from dividends!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ronstanding We'll disagree &amp; I remember further back than the 70's! Most industries were union led then, it was different times, Austin (example) never did a week without a strike! Thatcher privatised water, energy, steel, mining, buses, trains....all more expensive &amp; less efficient now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ronstanding You mean the ideology of private ownership, market economics, capitalism &amp; right wing Conservatism presumably when people are exploited to help increase wealth for billionaires? Taxpayers are best served when the profits from service providers go back to the people not the 1%!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Baggiepat Hard isn't it! Hate all these blank Saturdays - isn't even the same when game moved to a Monday!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@terrywoneill @jamielaird_ @UKLabour Boing, boing! üòú<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@terrywoneill @jamielaird_ @UKLabour Just what I was thinking about you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@terrywoneill @jamielaird_ @UKLabour Yep<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@terrywoneill @jamielaird_ @UKLabour Selfish attitude!  "I'm alright, sod the rest of you!" Voting Tory?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't think it's particularly radical to think public services should be in public ownership &amp; provided not "for profit" but for common good! Apparently that makes me a "communist" if you listen to Tories, who prefer lining pockets of the already rich &amp; privileged! #VoteLabour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hepworthclare @xpressanny Quite! Trying to manage a demand driven service within predetermined budgets isn't possible! You manage demand by responding to its peaks &amp; troughs &amp; that requires flexibility in budgets! Impossible to control demand when what it will be can't be quantified!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 Serious question Nicola. How do you think Galloway will get on in West Brom East? Is it your constituency?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffreyMorris3 Quite - PM would probably be blowing his own trumpet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 Lol - it was a sarcastic joke! It's a ministerial tradition that happens on a change of government either way! It's gone on since Victorian times! The "diposed" Minister leaves a note for his successor! Only an idiot would take it seriously!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 The debt was ¬£700bn at end of Labour's last govt - that was ¬£200bn less than they inherited from Thatcher/Major governments - its ¬£2 trillion now - Tories have tripled it in 9 years! Great financial management! Plus 9 years austerity for us all, to give tax cuts to billionaires!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 Great, I'll take that! Big improvement on this fornicating, blabbering moron we have at the moment!  https://t.co/Loz0tmMmil<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure how many more times he can say "get Brexit done" in one interview! Obviously has a list of sound bites he's been told to get in, never mind in what context! #BBCBreakfast #Johnson<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@histevegray Yes she's wonderful - so intelligent &amp; obedient - loves taking commands! She isn't trained to work sheep &amp; she's probably too old to learn now but vet said she'd have been a good working dog.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Andrew_Adonis @jennywackett Sadly if they "keep out" Labour, they "keep in" Tories! For them to form a government on their own, they need to gain over 250 seats - impossible - so a Vote LibDim is a vote Tory! Not very bright are they!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SandwellSkidder I think the point of the original comment that's being questioned was that they should do part time work outside of nursing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SandwellSkidder No, you are right &amp; I'm agreeing with you! External agency shifts, hospital bank hours, unpaid overtime - just questioning why anyone would think they could fit in part time jobs too &amp; not collapse with exhaustion!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SandwellSkidder Still do in many cases - they also often work unexpected, unpaid overtime at end of normal shifts to cover staff shortages, so not quite sure when they could fit in extra "part time" work!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Berry Bros put out some great whisky!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus You'd think they'd do it for "buy one, get one free" wouldn't you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Do you think one will be enough?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus That's wonderful! I'll be up by Burn's Night! First round is on me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mark4WyreForest Oh come on! It's not a good point at all! Lots of public services, including NHS, are provided 7 days a week by employees who only work 4/5 days a week! Its covered by normal rota/shift working patterns! Anyone with a basic knowledge of running a business or service knows that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, that was like a Monty Python sketch #partlysatiricalbroadcast just on BBC on behalf of the #Tories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Perceptive....üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Yes - I have a look most days! I think he's great!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xpressanny @NubiBlue @simonmaginn @BBCNews @BBCPolitics @BBCBreakfast @bbclaurak @afneil @bbcnickrobinson Trouble is, people on social media see this &amp; complain, but absolutely millions not on social media see it on tv &amp; are influenced! BBC then say "whoops, sorry" on social media but millions don't see it &amp; are still influenced - so job done! It's planned &amp; effective!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hepworthclare @tonyglover11 Also, since I believe China already controls most of the world's steel production, buying British Steel puts them in the position of being monopoly supplier, so they now have UK businesses over a barrel &amp; can charge what they like now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElderJillian @rhp859 @trueclausefour @ProletaireY @MichelleJaspe11 @gruttocks1 Yes it would good be a useful thing to be taught in schools!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rhp859 @trueclausefour @ProletaireY @MichelleJaspe11 @gruttocks1 I did a media course some years later on "manipulation by press" where they showed film of that chronologically shot, then they showed what appeared on tv! Never trusted BBC to tell the truth on anything since!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1davei @huntywbafc @martincroom @GoldbergRadio @TaffieBaggie Yes you're right - I'd forgotten that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@huntywbafc @AdamHingley @martincroom @GoldbergRadio @TaffieBaggie Exactly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@huntywbafc @martincroom @GoldbergRadio @TaffieBaggie The infrastructure is in place to fill that corner with seats - stand was built with that intention! I seem to remember that corner will take another 3000 at relatively low cost! That takes capacity to 30000! Should be a "given" that it will be done if we go up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamHingley @martincroom @GoldbergRadio @TaffieBaggie Thats average gates - to achieve that you get bigger gates &amp; smaller gates - we frequently got 35000+ in big games then! Capacity was reduced when we went all seater! Average now is 25000ish to get the average up you need a bigger capacity! Getting more in - back to marketing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@huntywbafc @martincroom @GoldbergRadio @TaffieBaggie Quite &amp; I'm agreeing with Adrian &amp; just defending the rationale of what we should be doing - the argument is about "theory" &amp; how club show ambition - it's not about what they currently might do in "practice" - which is why ambitious clubs will progress &amp; we'll be "also rans!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martincroom @GoldbergRadio @TaffieBaggie Well ok but the "financial model" was the one used! Was Chair of S4A at time &amp; had many detailed discussions with Thompson when he was planning it &amp; moderating risk to the club! There was none &amp; that's been proved! He had plans to take capacity up significantly! JP dumped them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martincroom @GoldbergRadio @TaffieBaggie The Halfords Lane stand was built to take another tier so build on top! Probably cost ¬£10m - we pay that for Championship player! Back in PL finance ¬£10m on term loan over 15 years, with interest, cost ¬£1m a year! If we can't afford that on an PL income of ¬£150m we've a problem!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martincroom @GoldbergRadio @TaffieBaggie I've covered that! The East Stand cost ¬£6m was it? 25 year mortgage/loan 15 years ago - repayments from cashflow! You don't pay for major capital expansion with money up front, you finance it over years! I used to get the accounts when I was shareholder, it easily was manageable!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@huntywbafc @martincroom @GoldbergRadio @TaffieBaggie It's not about what will or might happen ffs! Its about how the club should be thinking if it wants to progress! Adrian's opening point was  we don't actively market the club - we're passive - it will ultimately be our downfall!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martincroom @GoldbergRadio @TaffieBaggie Don't really expect solicitors &amp; accountants (üòú) to understand the concept of balanced risk taking &amp; marketing the club to firstly mark time &amp; then stimulate growth! Its about balancing risk against ambition the finance comes from low risk long term financing funded from income!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie @martincroom @GoldbergRadio Read the whole thread - I'm not going over it all again...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martincroom @GoldbergRadio Thompson *had* that foresight...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martincroom @GoldbergRadio The argument isn't how much its costs - you achieve that the way the East Stand was built on 25 year mortgage - Thompson has that foresight - the argument is it should be the vision &amp; ambition of club to be looking to market it &amp; grow! We will never progress with current capacity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martincroom @GoldbergRadio Filbert St had capacity of 22000 - Leicester never sold it out! Someone had a vision &amp; said let's grow this club &amp; build a stadium to take 32000! They did - they fill it nearly every game &amp; the club grows! That's a 50% growth in fan base in less than 10 years! Vision &amp; ambition!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martincroom @GoldbergRadio Ran out of space but .....base is up 5000 from current average of 25000! You achieve that with proper marketing....which is where this started with Adrian's original tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martincroom @GoldbergRadio It's not about filling ground - it's about having capacity bigger than 27000 to enable some growth in the fan base! You can't do that with current capacity - so where do next generation come from? If capacity was, say 35000, &amp; we got it to an average of 30000, base is up 5000!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martincroom @GoldbergRadio No like Leicester! Coventry didn't own their ground, had dodgy directors, overspent in PL, overspent trying to get back, borrowed too much, fell out with their landlord &amp; finished back in the division they've spent most of their history in! Poor comparison imho Martin!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@creadie84 @GoldbergRadio I agree I don't think the ambition is there with the owners! Its the clubs with ambitious owners that progress! Not just about developing a decent team - everything else has to go with it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@creadie84 @GoldbergRadio It's not about selling out! It's about raising the capacity so you can get more in than 27000 top &amp; increase the core fan base! If capacity was 35000 &amp; 30000 came to every games that's 4000 more than average now! Stimulate growth incrementally!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@creadie84 @GoldbergRadio Not many clubs, apart from obvious ones, sell out every game but when there is big game the capacity is there to accommodate it! Leicester seldom filled Filbert Street but look at their average gate now &amp; where an ambitious owner took them! Just one example - there are others!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoldbergRadio Absolutely. We don't market the club at all as far as I'm aware! We should have developed ground when we were only PL team locally! There's loads we could've done to bring more in! Now's great time to promote club but if theres only a couple thousand free seats there's no point!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoldbergRadio Agree Adrian. Club say they don't fill the ground now but when we eventually do isn't the time to extend it cos it takes time &amp; impetus is lost! An ambitious club should extend capacity, then aim to fill it! Other clubs have successfully done that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie @RyanPGlasgow @AshBurty @Algore1990 Semi can play in midfield if needed &amp; bring Hegazi in! Only concern would be messing with the back 4 when it's looking tight now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray Well I was a huge fan of both - so hard to choose! So I won't!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray üòâüëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just heard someone on radio say he'd "been in France &amp; taken his wife up the Gironde"  Response was "I've never heard it called that before!" ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ind_Broker Well yes, but he's no actor is he!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ind_Broker Quite - I thought he was appalling &amp; his body language suggested a total lack of sincerity!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is an extended political broadcast by Hancock! 20 minutes &amp; counting - hardy being scrutinised in his answers - free hit! #BBCBreakfast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Funny though isn't it - we can see the options &amp; how things could work, but, apparently, the "intelligent" ones in power can't seem to think laterally ot "out side the box!" All very shallow  &amp; superficial!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Not their books though are they, so no problem with that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Wouldn't work because when you go another GE would be required &amp; in 18 months nothing much would have changed, so likely give what's left of Union another Tory government! The point is to give Labour the chance to make a difference &amp; win on merit, not by default of coalition!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus The vote would be quicker - say 2 years - just the split would be when the next GE takes place! Less messy &amp; time to sort the detail!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus My view, which I've mentioned before, is Labour offers SNP another indie ref for guaranteed one term in government with "split" at end of 5 years! SNP then get to work in partnership in UK government to influence terms! It ain't rocket science &amp; it gets rid of Tories!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray @shantih_73 @UKChange WF CLP have been asking Region for months to sanction local selection! Requests have been rudely, consistently, ignored! 3 local activists were available! They knew nothing till candidate from out of area was announced! It stinks - don't try to rationalise it! We've been shafted!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@phoenixbaggie @StrongerStabler @BBCBreaking @BBCNews @BBCBreakfast @SkyNews @BBCr4today @itvnews Quite - I think it's out there now - idiots that support him must be as inebriated as his is! Or stupid! Or both!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray @shantih_73 @UKChange Don't know about the others but hours after they imposed an out of area, Blairite, paper candidate in Wyre Forest, they asked for names for a full, competitive, open selection in Hall Green! No reason not to let WF choose it's own candidate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StrongerStabler @phoenixbaggie Funnily enough I haven't seen this mentioned on @BBCBreaking @BBCNews @BBCBreakfast @SkyNews @BBCr4today or @itvnews yet! Come on guys, balance, impartiality, lack of bias? I'll wait!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NigelGilbert4 @corinnebailey Really don't know what goes on inside local party now since I haven't been "active" for sometime! However there is a petition started on Facebook by Kevin Ashton asking him to stand down - so clearly there is some momentum to overturn this appointment!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NigelGilbert4 @corinnebailey I agree totally Nigel. I think he's being incredibly selfish &amp; self serving accepting this "appointment" it isn't a democratic appointment, it's imposed! Hours after it was announced, party called for nominations for "competition" in Hall Green, so time was there for due process!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@corinnebailey @harrierkarl Agree - Worcester is a key "must win" isn't it! My big wish would be to get Javid out but that needs probably too big a swing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@corinnebailey @harrierkarl Its influenced mine! He also stood twiice in Mid Worcestershire (2010 &amp; 2015) more as a token candidate I think, since not seen as a winnable seat! Realistically I think that's why he's been shipped in here, because it's not seen as a winnable seat by party! Paper appointment!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@corinnebailey @harrierkarl Wouldn't have been my choice - a confirmed &amp; strong Blairite I believe. Also understand he had previous Labour leader at county removed because he wouldn't sign a letter that he'd written to JC telling him to resign! This is the candidate the party think WF deserves??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noseybstard @PeterStefanovi2 Isn't she just!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@corinnebailey I'm incandescent with anger....and I was aware of what was going on &amp; who was in the frame...likewise won't say too much now but massive own goal that will backfire!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour supporters in Wyre Forest may not have seen this! Have to say....he has a point!  https://t.co/haxVGroXnf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lazydave68 Disagree - the job of media should be to report the facts &amp; inform without bias! Let people decide what they believe - but "news" outlets shouldn't try to determine opinion for them - that's about bias, vested interests &amp; misinformation - that's what promotes lies!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TGFMichaelRosen @elwydragon Problem is, purdah applies to candidates in an election &amp; parties standing in an election! Austin isn't a candidate &amp; not a party member - he's just a member of the public giving his opinion &amp; media have, intentionally, exploited the loophole to maximum effect! Its intended bias!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lazydave68 Less those not in power than those trying to hang onto it! But it's not what parties say but how the media present it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alansmoore @DavidKe30081373 Correct!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidKe30081373 Did a media course years ago - said get your message in the headline &amp; first paragraph cos the rest is irrelevant! The "attention span of most readers is that of a 10yo" - you are right - sound bites is all that matters!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Only 7 years? Trouble is, anyone with a brain realises it - but they play on the presumption that most are thick! I'll leave it there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The trouble with lies in politics is people hear the first statement &amp; it sticks - they don't hear the retraction or apology! Most lies are intended &amp; are not "inadvertent" or "accidental!" Too many are too naive to realise they're being manipulated! #ToryLies #MSMLies #FakeNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NathanielBayard And, yes, @bbclaurak is spinning her own biased agenda on this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NathanielBayard He's Blairite to the core! 10 years ago that would have been "mainstream" Labour, but the party has moved on &amp; he hasn't &amp; he won't accept democracy! So, no, he isn't 'Labour to the core' - he's bitter &amp; a childish loser!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Philj77 It wasn't a #Labour invention - it was John Major who introduced it! Blair's  government carried it on to extreme, but current Tory government debt is nearly 3 times more than that left by Labour - getting worse every year! 9 years of cuts, financial mismanagement &amp; incompetence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bivver5 @maxmcevoy @BBCr4today @bbcnickrobinson Judging by Austin's blanket personal appearance on every major news outlet this morning &amp; his comments quickly repeated as lead story on news bulletins this was pre-planned &amp; coordinated! It was his opinion, not a statement of fact! It should have been ignored! #bias #CorruptNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BDY1990 On reflection, they probably get round the rules on purdah because he isn't a candidate in the election &amp; this is the day after he announced it! But still of the opinion it's a stage managed set up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BDY1990 I was a councillor for years &amp; was invited onto WM to speak about the Baggies but in an election period - when they found out I was a politician they dropped me incase I said "anything political!" That's how careful they were then!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BDY1990 Purdah also applies to giving air time to allow politicians to "overtly promote an opinion"  - he's on #BBCBreakfast in an extended interview as I type this, spouting vitriol &amp; bile, completely unchallenged!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now live on #bbcbreakfast - this is not balance or unbiased &amp; my knowledge of purdah, after years of experience both as an official &amp; an active politician, is that this breaks the rules! Shameful manipulation by BBC! #bbcbias<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now #BBCMidlands news is carrying it as its lead story with suitable added film footage! Remarkable how quickly they've been able to put it together!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ian Austin is entitled to his opinion &amp; is free to say what he thinks but for #BBCBreakfast to immediately "spin" it as "news" minutes later suggests an agenda which is predetermined! Purdah requires balance &amp; impartiality but "reporting" gets round it - so create the news!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @LaboursBlackPLP @parvaest @Keir_Starmer @JamesCleverly Absolutely - yahboo politics turns people off &amp; minimises the real issues - which is what some people want! Personalities before policies is all some understand!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@art_bowles @WillBlackWriter @JamesCleverly Well yes - an unreserved apology - cos I can slag off who I like but if I apologise it's ok! So that's alright!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@art_bowles @WillBlackWriter The Tory Party select who stands where &amp; some seats are so safe they could put a donkey up &amp; it would be elected! In @JamesCleverly case that's exactly what happened!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LaboursBlackPLP @parvaest @Keir_Starmer I'm convinced @JamesCleverly is a light hearted &amp; satirical parody of a politician because he surely can't expect anyone to ever take him seriously!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ksshuttle Since parliament is now dissolved the committee that considers petitions is also now dissolved since it was made up of MP's!

<|startoftext|>@WarmongerHodges If Johnson had a Scouse/Geordie/Brummie accent he wouldn't pull a vote! Posh boy attracts forelock tuggers in abundance because they think he knows best - "cos he's posh!" Its how the elite stay in control!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bfatchett @sharpeleven @robjeffecology You know if Murdoch &amp; others in media suddenly got behind Labour they would romp home! It was only reason Blair Gov't got elected! Morally totally wrong, but still a fact of how gullible the electorate are! A shift in emphasis by BBC away from "Boris" love in would deliver change<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett @sharpeleven @robjeffecology @bbclaurak They haven't been overtly critical of Labour though have they - its covert &amp; subliminal! For instance, Pienaar, last week presented a factual piece on Labour policy on 32 hour week &amp; minimum wage of ¬£10 per hour!   Then he added personal comments to rubbish it! Not news - spin!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 Quite - discrimination is discrimination - colour, race, religion, sexuality and now age! Stinks doesn't it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett @sharpeleven @robjeffecology And it isn't about challenging anyone! Its about presenting the news as facts without spinning it to offer a prearranged agenda, which they don't do! Try to tell me @bbclaurak &amp; some of her cronies are showing "left wing bias!" 10/20 years ago maybe BBC was "left" but not now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett @sharpeleven @robjeffecology Sorry Brendan but look at those in top positions in BBC News now - members of Tory Party at Uni &amp; still now in some cases! Your distaste for Corbyn's Labour colours your objectivity &amp; as such will ensure a another Tory government if you are to be believed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sharpeleven @robjeffecology Isn't the real problem those in control of #BBCNews &amp; their backgrounds - scrutiny would show strong "political" bias, support, membership of the Tory Party! It isn't a "free press" where BBC is concerned! The country is being "played!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 Don't think age is the problem that needs addressing, Andy - its IQ! There are some really thick shits out there of all political persuasions who shouldn't be allowed anywhere near a ballot box skewering the results for the rest of us, cos they don't have a clue!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bigboy54848037 Good morning Ian. üòÅ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamHingley @LibDems Agree totally - I understand why some might not like JC (I rate him btw) but if Labour win, he'll stand down mid term, in my opinion, &amp; be replaced! But if Tories win, that's it for 5 years...more of the last 9, only worse! I really don't see how people can vote for that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamHingley @LibDems Interesting times though isn't it Adam! All speculation till it happens!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamHingley @LibDems Yes I agree. Not sure what Farage is playing at putting a big slate up - as you say, its mainly Tory voters he'll pull!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just put #BOUMUN game on.. What's this rancid cream shirt United  are wearing? Or does it sum up where they are in English football now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamHingley @LibDems South West they are strong - but its them or Tory there - few seats where Labour is second - so Labour don't lose anything by them doing well there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamHingley @LibDems Likewise - it's an horrendous thought  - but I think she would!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamHingley @LibDems Maybe - but that leaves 550 split between Tory/Labour! 450 are nailed on to split between 2 major parties - never change. So 200 seats that move around a bit decide it! SNP will get 50+, Plaid 5/6? LibDems 20? The only party who could realistically offer a deal is SNP to Labour!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamHingley @LibDems No problem mate - I agree that a Labour/SNP deal is a realistic option  but, while I have no problem, usually, with LibDems, I really don't rate Swinson - think she is taking her party "right" &amp; that's a shame! If Tories are close to government after GE, she'll prop them up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LibDems Fine... &amp; Greens &amp; Brexit Party &amp; Monster Raving Loonies &amp; every other party that doesn't have a cats hope in hell of breaking the dominance of two parties! LibDems are irrelevant in this election!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ToryFibs I noticed Pienaar on @BBCNews  couple of days ago setting out key #Labour policy areas! He offered a factual statement of policy - then qualified every one with an "opinion" that said "but that would (add his negative comment)" NEWS should be facts - analysis shouldn't cloud it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ToryFibs Trouble is its difficult to define where the line is crossed! A lie is a lie but "spinning" facts &amp; offering biased opinion on them is difficult to stop! It requires the reader to apply judgement &amp; too many don't possess  that degree of perception - they take the "spin" as fact!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Sbaggieboy60 @RobPaddockWBA Tried to like it Shaun but don't! Used to watch League a bit when Eddie Waring was on tv &amp; found that more to my liking!

<|startoftext|>@nevillefarmer Yes - be interesting to see the list of candidates here when its known!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nevillefarmer Absolutely! 450 seats don't matter - they aren't up for grabs &amp; will stay with who they always do! Its the other 200 who'll decide it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nevillefarmer Labour floaters maybe, Nev, but probably not "hard core" supporters! Tory supporters frustrated with Johnson failure to deliver more likely to jump ship! Interesting times though!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Judging by some of the comments on here this morning, never mind of which "persuasion" they are, the lack of perception &amp; understanding displayed by too many is frightening!

<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Yes it was the Scotsman that reported it but it was a Survation Poll that they were quoting. It was mentioned in an article about it being a "blow" Sturgeon.

<|startoftext|>@WBADyl Well to start with Newcastle wanted ¬£20m for Gayle last summer - so that's out! Long has scored 25 goals in 150 games at Southampton so ¬£10m at 32 is money wasted! However, Pereira is young, scores goals &amp; is ours for ¬£9m! So the clue is there - look abroad &amp; scout outside UK!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WBADyl Shane Long is 32 now ffs! Move on, he's past it &amp; 2 years older than Charlie Austin! We've had our share of "late age" strikers who have failed! We need a striker, but someone on the "up!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darkmuse @DavidNeal8 @SoVeryBritish We did try that for a couple of years in the early 70's - people hated it - still dark at 9 in the morning mid winter &amp; people hated it - so they dropped it!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mojos55 Thing is...bias, to be effective, has to be covert &amp; subtle so it isn't seen as bias and just plays on the subconscious!

<|startoftext|>@tomwba1982 Quite - agree totally! If we were bottom of league, played away &amp; drew against top club... we'd be content! Our first half hour was the problem, not Barnsley tactics! We have to deal with it, it'll happen again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone else get the feeling that customer support links are perversely thick, stupid or trained to appear so? I write, simple, plain English &amp; they "misunderstand" every comment &amp; trot out the corporate response! #CustomerService generally stinks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ind_Broker Quite - we won't always play well, so last night was "a get out of jail" game! To be fair, first half Barnsley were excellent but blew it second half by trying to shut up shop! I'm content with how its going really &amp; I'm not easy to please!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVan @jamestaylor1 Agree - but I think we may still improve! It's the resilience impresses me at the moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamestaylor1 @TheVan It's fine! Fact is we were shocking first half really, but still got something out of the game! For years we'd have lost that! That's why I think this team's different!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVan I've been an Albion fan long enough to know it's never too early for anything where the Baggies are concerned!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Before Saturday, I'd have been happy with 4 points from Middlesbrough &amp; Barnsley games! We got 4 points - so nothing's changed. Beat Charlton  &amp; it'll have been a good week! No harm done. Percentages! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus I'll have a look. For a time our local Co-op sourced a load of local food, pickles, jams, cooked meats etc - lovely stuff. Then they changed the store manager &amp; he seemed to drop it all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Absolutely!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie Yep....they are to me! üëçüòÅ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus No I'm not. Perhaps I should be!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyway.....sod #Brexit....the #baggies are playing tonight! #priorities #firstthingsfirst #onwardsandupwards #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@petervhale Wouldn't be the first time he's pulled!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a self appointed world authority on the quality of cherries I can confirm that the South African  variety currently on sale are a very poor substitute for Kentish cherries available in July! #Kent #englishfruit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Deciding UK's future in just 3 days of  pantomime debate in the bear pit that is the HoC is a poor substitute for the more normal &amp; less confrontational scrutiny in Committee first which would normally take place! Makes you wonder if there's a hidden agenda! #BrexitShambles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OldSussexStud @Peter__Howells Could be.....for a fee!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OldSussexStud @Peter__Howells They're all at sea already! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmazonHelp Thing is you don't understand! I don't want the Prime free trial in the first place.....but I can't refuse it! I'm not going to accept it because you don't give me the ability to refuse it &amp; then have to cancel it! So I just won't buy from you again until this situation is ended!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie @AmazonUK It's very annoying! Their pathetic response basically was just accept it, then cancel it! Not very helpful really - I want the option to opt out without accepting it, but that isn't available!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdwardLeave There are parliamentary rules of procedure. The role of the Speaker is to apply them - which he does! His role is the same as the role of Chair in any organisation! If he acted incorrectly in law it would be open to challenge! Some moan but none challenge his ruling! #JohnBercow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad news - Charles was responsible for so much good in Kidderminster and probably achieved more for our town than any other single person. His support &amp; guidance to those of us who have performed civic roles was invaluable. A privilege to have known him. RIP. @ksshuttle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Ta - I'll have a look.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Seen a couple of things by him but I check him out some more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmazonHelp No can't be bothered! I don't want a Prime Trial forced on me that I then have to cancel! I'm not opting in to something I don't want to have to opt out again! This is shabby marketing &amp; effectively inertia selling by #Amazon! Simple solution for me is don't buy from you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmazonHelp Sorry but it doesn't work! I've gone to checkout, change delivery to free delivery 3-5 days, said to proceed without free Prime Trial - I click next box &amp; again it says, before I complete order, "we're giving you a free Prime Trial" - don't want one so cancelled order!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've stopped buying from @AmazonUK until they stop trying to force a "free" Prime trial on me! I don't want it, can't refuse it at checkout &amp; can only opt out after I've accepted it on first place! Borderline inertia marketing which is, I think, illegal? So you've lost a customer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteMM19 @vamroses When I started work, I was approached to join a union (civil service). Within a week I was branch treasurer - that's where my socialism was born! 50 years ago &amp; counting! When people call me a "leftie" it's a badge of honour, not an insult!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GuyFSAuthor I remember exactly where I first heard the news - not many disasters that have such a profound effect! So tragic &amp; haunting! #aberfandisaster<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dickie034 @TheCricketerMag I'm prone to understatement! üòâ #OpposeThe100<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dickie034 @TheCricketerMag May contain nuts....! #OpposeThe100<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Adds a new meaning to "Boycott" for me! I'd have travelled to watch the batsman - I won't be watching the "tournament!" #OpposeThe100<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerekPoulton Don't we just! Isn't it refreshing! It wasn't a great performance yesterday but the individual skill on display &amp; the way we play meant it was never boring! I never moaned once üòÇ - couldn't say that over last few seasons!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 Yes - jeeessuusss (sorry for expletive) it was every single gantry over M1, M6, M18! Imagine being a HGV driver on way to Dover! You'd be suicidal with panic by time you got there hoping the shipping office got the documents right! Bet Eddie Stobarts are sweating!üòÇüòÇüòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 Lol - nothing is ever what it seems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 Incidentally - did you go to Middlesbrough yesterday (don't know if you ever go away) - but every motorway overhead sign had a Brexit warning about customs paperwork from 1 November! Overkill personified!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 Yes - my response was tongue in cheek! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 Probably not! Would you trust UK voters to know what they were voting for?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 The money the government spend on weapons is UK tax payers money - that insults my beliefs more than what we pay in EU membership! Can I have a referendum on that next?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 Why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 30000 EU laws, directives etc in 40 years - all but 70 freely accepted in to UK law by HoC without any issues - of the 70 that UK objected to, all gave better options to UK citizens than the UK alternative to the EU proposal. We have a self governing, independent nation already!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 Won't fall out with you either Nicola - its opinions - not life or death is it, but see this üëá - it peanuts gross (2% of net UK annual govt spending) &amp; net, with Grant's, rebates, it's even less! You don't pay in to membership of anything &amp; expect it all back!  https://t.co/GyRlE0cnpF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adam_Townsend @Njr8691 Came to that conclusion weeks ago!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 Don't be precious please! And I spelt it wrong on purpose to be colloquial rather than specific!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 And what benefits do you see from #Brexit? I've asked you twice before but you never reply with anything other than "taking back control" which is Faragesque bollox!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 Why do you need contingency plans for something that is claimed to be better than what you already have?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 Nothing to do with the "left" - they don't come more "right" than the DUP or some rebel Tories &amp; they're against it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 No deal would be a total disaster! Most sane people recognise that! Leaving with a decent deal is a different matter! I'm remain, as you know, but if people still want to leave  it has to be with significant damage limitation - crashing out doesn't give that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been a cynic/sceptic for years politically - but if #Johnson real bottom line was to deliver #NoDeal, it makes sense to offer a #deal worse than May's to HoC which you know will be rejected!  Then blame everyone else for not supporting it when crash out comes! #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Walnut bread - yum yum. #lunch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@starbie99 @Keir_Starmer @BorisJohnson Absolutely - he is one of the few people I really listen to &amp; trust on this! Clear, knowledgeable &amp; unequivocal every time I hear him speak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are we supposed to believe that having Sarah Vine on #marr this morning is offering an objective analysis on current issues? Are we to realistically believe she isn't going to follow the Gove family line?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie Agree - Statham for me too - no one else comes close!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie The short passing they are using is great to watch &amp; is so much more enjoyable &amp; exciting than what we've seen in recent years! Think we just may be on verge of something special!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie Yes - there's one or two from the past who'd fit in beautifully now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie I've got a list too....starts with Allen, Barlow...so he was probably right saying I looked old enough to have seen some good sides! üòâüòÅ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Albion fan said to me today "don't mean to be rude (üôÑ) but you look old enough to have probably seen some good Albion sides?"  "Yep" says l "I was at the last home game when we beat Cardiff 4-2!"  As Henry Ford said "history is bunk - it's now that matters!" #paraphrased  #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes you have to win "messy" &amp; teams that do usually do well! Last few seasons we'd have lost today - what a difference now - but team kept going &amp; nicked a goal! And how good was @samjohnstone50 today! Clean sheet was just as much a reason for winning as scoring!  #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Tough call - but could! Always a hard game though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Abstinence should never be on the agenda!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My plan for Sunday if #SuperSaturday doesn't go well!  https://t.co/otkv9cnDCk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@narrowboaterboy @TripeUK Well, certainly of the fancy ones....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@garwalbion @sainsburys Its lovely to be able to pick fresh fruit! I come from Kent originally &amp; as a kid mainly had apples, plums, cherries &amp; most soft fruit free &amp; fresh out of friends gardens! ......or went scrumping! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@garwalbion @sainsburys Not where I live with petrol &amp; time to get to where any grow! Unless I go by üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ....üòÑ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TripeUK When I was a kid &amp; got my hair cut on a Friday, I never understood why the barber always asked the "grown up" men if they wanted #somethingfortheweekend - didn't realise it was a #tripe supper!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Increasingly of opinion @sainsburys is run by idiots! English blackberries today ¬£1.20 for 150gms - next to Mexican blackberries ¬£2 for 150gms - so why fly them in? But you scrap plastic bags for loose fruit &amp; veg &amp; create more waste with larger, pre packed, quantities! Stupid!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@worcesternews Turkey's voting for Christmas comes to mind!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenWFLabour Quite! "Time" isn't the issue &amp; rushing a "deal" to meet an artificial &amp; arbitrarily set deadline is ridiculous! If "leave" is to be the final outcome then this deal isn't "the one!" If a people's vote or second referendum is going to happen, a rushed, inferior deal isn't needed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alansmoore Quite - he's a worst case of style over substance! Man's a complete moron!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thought it was always understood by anyone with a brain that "leaving" probably meant years of negotiation sorting out the fine print! Clearly Farage missed that? @alansmoore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SandwellSkidder Now don't be negative....its probably a better option than Winson Green! üòâüòÑ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sainsburys Thank you  Mariya - the store told me that many of the "speciality breads" baked in-store were shortly to be discontinued &amp; some already have! Particularly of concern to me are the sourdough brands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizJRudd @sainsburys Seem to be losing the plot a bit, don't they?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would @sainsburys like to comment on why they are, apparently, discontinuing many of their better, in-store, baked breads? Including some which are "best sellers!" Another disappointing down grade in service &amp; choice offered to customers! #sainsburys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All that's missing here is the cauldron.....! #ripoffbritain<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rjdowning Twin it is then....really looked like you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie @PeterStefanovi2 Well yes...I was going to tweet that back to you....you beat me to it! üòú<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie @PeterStefanovi2 Maybe, but you can't disenfranchise people because they don't choose to have photo ID. Democracy requires that everyone entitled to vote should be able to vote! If the government proposed photo ID for everyone by law, then it works. Until then, its patently unfair &amp; selective!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterStefanovi2 Seems perverse that photo ID isn't mandatory for anyone within UK law but photo ID is being made mandatory to vote! It doesn't improve democracy, it harms it! How can a "free choice" to drive or have a passport be made a requirement to vote!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rjdowning - have I just seen you on Midlands Today film of the Great B'ham Run? If not, you've got a twin!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Yes - lovely fish. Mind you I'm a big fan on most fish anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislepkowski Think you've excelled yourself with gentle understatement there Chris! üòÑüëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Looks delicious!  Btw - hope you come back before 31 October otherwise you may be denied re-entry as an undesirable alien!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Or..."its a f.....k joke!" Same comment really!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevieCABZ @up_again @BlogRedRobin Exactly my understanding! Thanks for that! Shambles rules - but seems Queen's Speech is a ploy to force the issue &amp; by intent!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevieCABZ @up_again @BlogRedRobin Then, presumably, if Queen's Speech isn't adopted (unprecedented?) government will have to resign, since it sets out their parliamentary agenda in next session! And if government resigns, Queen, by convention, asked Leader of Opposition to form govt. Or GE with agreement of HoC!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevieCABZ @up_again @BlogRedRobin So what happens if you are, say 75, don't drive &amp; Passport has expired? No vote? Or 18, never driven or applied for a Passport? No vote? And people want more democracy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamKohChang @abroadwithalec Quite - its man v clock, not man v man! Totally valid! I remember, as a very (very!) young child, watching Roger Bannister on a shadowy tv in that epic run! One of those things people ask "where were you when...!"  Also stunned by what I saw this morning!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthews_boing Yep - agree! Same problem for me! Kidderminster nearest - postponed! No one else at home! Would have gone to Walsall if they'd been home!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Football does itself no favours with these "international break" weekends! No games, not even decent non-league fixture, within about 40 miles of me - another blank Saturday, which is the norm rather than the exception now! Rhythmic gymnastics it is then! #football #stuffthefans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesMelville Can anyone advise....presumably if there is no "hard border" between NI, with affiliate membership of EU, &amp; the Republic, then the "hard border"  customs controls, etc, will be between NI &amp; rest of UK? So how does it solve anything?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 Lol - you mentioned Brum, Steve... but change it to Manchester Ship Canal, doubt theres much living in that! Not sure fishing for mackerel off Wigan Pier would be very successful either!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 Yes - selling shell fish into pubs used to be a regular event didn't it! Not sure "straight off the boat" in Brum was ever strictly accurate though! Don't think you get many shellfish in Grand Union Canal! üòÑ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bought some brown shrimps for lunch...cost me about ¬£4! I remember when you could buy them off a woman with a hand cart, fresh out of #Whitstable Bay that morning, for 1/6 a pint! They tasted awesome! Showing my age!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trussliz @iccwbo @wto The abject ignorance of this from a UK Minister is stunning - the lunatics really have taken over the asylum!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@L__Macfarlane State control of our thoughts next! The slippery slope gets steeper! #thoughtpolice #GeorgeOrwell #distopianbritain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNewsBreak Let's see which of them claim "overtime" for Saturday working! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus No apologies needed! If we can't debate without sometimes having a "difference" it would be a very sterile conversation! üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WarwickHunt4 We called that "knock down ginger" when I was a kid! Knock on a door &amp; run away before anyone answered! She needs to find gainful employment! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darr3nHall Yes - get my prescription every 2 months - last time small delay of 2 days for one item. This time it's now 10 days &amp; they "don't know" when they'll be able to get any - said "come back next Monday"! If they can't get it soon I'll need to visit doctor to consider other options!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies @WBA @jaysoule9 Agree - years without many coming through, now we have so many good prospects.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mark_rollason Yes,  hearing of quite a few with similar experiences!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ronstanding @WBA @jaysoule9 Yes, I think that was probably what turned the others heads earlier this season!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus *start* - predictive text got that wrong - not me! Trust me... I'm a politician....! üòú<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus I had a private education too, funnily enough - it taught me to think for myself &amp; made me a socialist - there's nothing in socialism says you have to have morals &amp; a conscience only if you come from a poor state in life! Some of us want a better life for all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Then independence is stuffed... never get with a Tory government!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Don't judge Labour by the blairite dinosaurs who still rule up there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus With epaulets with SS on his shoulders! But realistically, the only chance in foreseeable future of another indie ref in Scotland is a Labour lead government with SNP in support/coalition with them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Times move on - attitudes change -  &amp; as I say - "needs must!" Politics isn't a finite position! The end game is more important than the journey!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WBA @jaysoule9 Sensible lad - hasn't had his head turned by "promises" that may never happen! Good to see!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Labour have already said Scottish independence is a matter for Scottish people to decide, so to enable another referendum is a worthwhile trade off for SNP support in forming a government! Needs must, on both sides!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Labour don't need to win seats in Scotland since SNP will get into bed with them to stop another Tory government! The "quid pro quo" will be Labour will promise another independence referendum implemented at end of first 5 year term! May or may not happen, but that's my scenario!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pharmacist told me this morning "unexpected &amp; unaccountable" shortages in some medicine they've never had problem with before! Apparently suppliers stock piling &amp; restricting release ahead of significant price rise expected if #NoDealBrexit! Hearsay &amp; opinion maybe, but worrying!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus If "power" is by gift of the establishment, like all PM's since those who came after, probably Wilson, then I'd agree! It's why the "establishment" shit themselves that there just might be a Corbyn lead government, since he wouldn't be in their pocket!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ronstanding @alexforeurope Little England more like!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnson isn't the "leader" - he's the puppet having his strings pulled by those who stand to make a fortune out of a #NoDealBrexit. Sadly, the gullible still think it's about "people v the establishment" &amp; "democracy!" Wise up! It is the establishment taking you down this road!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eucopresident @BorisJohnson Johnson played the Eton Wall Game at school - that's the one where the last goal was scored in about 150 years ago, I believe! Usually no one wins! Seems that's his aim with #NoDeal #learnedhislessonswell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@magneticsparrow @tom_watson Well quite....that's the bottom line really isn't it! üòÑüëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@magneticsparrow @tom_watson All parties set a manifesto - of course they're all designed to seek votes, whichever party it is! That's how a government gets elected! Delivering the promises is where the test comes! These proposals only mirror the opinion I've held on this issue for years! I welcome them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@magneticsparrow @tom_watson Jeremy Peace actually "robbed" several hundred honest Albion shareholders of the value of their stake in the club which they'd bought, by clever manipulation of ownership &amp; slipped off ¬£200m richer! So if changes in ownership rules changes that, so much the better!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@magneticsparrow @tom_watson Shareholders of any company already have the right to hire &amp; fire directors if the shares aren't all in limited ownership - why should football be any different?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@magneticsparrow @tom_watson They aren't suggesting nationalising any club - just some limited supporter appointed directors! It's what FSA &amp; shareholders groups have been campaigning for for years! Nothing wrong Labour saying "we've heard you &amp; we'll help you achieve it!" Giving fans a stake in their clubs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iancoll94354676 @vamroses Never understood that Ian! Sadly too many believe they are better off under a government that keeps them "in their place" whilst using them to enhance their own power &amp; wealth!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@magneticsparrow @tom_watson Why? Albion sold fans shares in mid 90's - I bought some! Albion have been trying to get safe standing too! When Thompson was Chairman, he was moving towards "fan" directors - I was chair of S4A then and had several discussions about it! All sensible &amp; desirable proposals!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Naz_Faulkner @tom_watson The Labour policy of enabling workers at companies to be shareholders was announced weeks ago! Keep up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iancoll94354676 @vamroses Quite frankly, these people are scum &amp; it's the fore lock tugging, working class who keep them in power cos the msm con them into believing #labour is a worse option! Idiots get what they vote for!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @Stephen83803374 @CathyMcRorie @joannaccherry @BorisJohnson Well.....I've still got some very special 25yo Glenmorangie left from a trip to the distillery 3 years ago - treated with due reverence, you understand - drunk sparingly! Feel like cheering myself up after this week (don't ask!) - so will indulge myself!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @Stephen83803374 @CathyMcRorie @joannaccherry @BorisJohnson My understanding is MP's can basically say pretty much what they like in parliamentary session - but if the Speaker thinks a "line has been crossed" he can ask for an apology or suspend them for a time. However, a lie is only proved with hindsight so is, probably, unsanctionable!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 @SkyNewsBreak Trouble is Steve - the whole thing seems to have been treated like a game by politicians since it started before the referendum! It's been a pantomime &amp; does no one any credit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cjdemooi Can you beat this? Made me smile! üëçüòÅ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNewsBreak Well done Scotland! Pay back time for the highland clearances &amp; Culloden! Worth the wait I'm sure!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luke_millichamp @PeterStefanovi2 Now....I could call that racist...but I won't! Diane Abbott is actually better educated with her qualifications from Uni &amp; more intelligent than about 95% of the population! And if you think Riley gets abuse - Diane Abbott gets it 10 times worse from people who are overtly racist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luke_millichamp @PeterStefanovi2 The recession wasn't of Labour's making though, it was caused by a crash in world money markets caused mainly by poor banking decisions! The austerity since 2010 was political choice by Tories which has actually raised the UK debt from ¬£800bn to ¬£1.7tn &amp; put millions into poverty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luke_millichamp @PeterStefanovi2 You know little about why those ex members raised the issues or the agenda they had against Corbyn on many more things besides this! And if you bothered to find out you'd know that all the complaints made were investigated &amp; acted on, if found to be true! Most weren't proved!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@impactsteve Soul mates then Steve! Onwards &amp; upwards! Keep the faith! üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TocquevilleJnr @SachiKnight @labour @novaramedia @PoliticsJOE_UK @PeoplesMomentum The problem isn't Labour's position - which is sensible, simple &amp; understandable, even if you aren't very bright - just #FionaBruce follows BBC internal memo which directs "Make Labour look stupid, doesn't matter what they say!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes you have one of those weeks you wish you'd rather not had, so, hopefully, tomorrow at the Hawthorns will change all that! #coyb #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luke_millichamp @PeterStefanovi2 Anyway cheers Luke - off out now but genuinely appreciate the exchange. Really usually better done over a beer &amp; a curry though than on Twitter! Less confrontational!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luke_millichamp @PeterStefanovi2 No surge in anti semitism - just a heightening of it as a convenient tool by "right" in party who didn't want Corbyn as leader! Look at the figures of those reported to party for alleged anti-semitism! About half weren't even party members &amp; those who were =0.2% of total members<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luke_millichamp @PeterStefanovi2 He isn't anti Jewish &amp; many Jews, both in an out of the party, will tell you that! Many on extremes of both the left &amp; right have had anti Jewish elements for years! I remember getting into deep discussions in support of Jews with extreme left (Stalinists) in college days (60's)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luke_millichamp @PeterStefanovi2 @RachelRileyRR And you call me brainwashed! She wants to be a Tory candidate &amp; despises Labour! And I agree she gets abuse but how is it Corbyn's fault! Much of the abuse she gets has been proved to be from right wing fascists - you know the sort who drove the holocaust &amp; murdered Jews!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luke_millichamp @PeterStefanovi2 You really don't understand the difference between anti semitic/Jewish &amp; anti Israel do you! I despise the Saudi government - doesn't make me Islamophobic! Israel is a country - Judaism is a religion &amp; Jews are a world wide ethic group! Disliking a political regime isn't racist!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luke_millichamp @PeterStefanovi2 And you're making assumptions about Corbyn! No I'm not brainwashed - I worked in central govt for years so I've "been at the coal face" &amp; seen it first hand! Shall we get on to Thatcher's relationship with dictators or current government illegally selling arms to Saudi Arabia?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luke_millichamp @PeterStefanovi2 And he certainly isn't anti semitic - he's pro Palestine &amp; that isn't anti Jewish! It's a political position not an ethnic or racist one! Not difficult to understand, unless you get all your opinions from the right wing press!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luke_millichamp @PeterStefanovi2 You really are a true blue, Tory boy Daily Mail reader aren't you! Didn't you know that Mo Mowlam, NI Secretary at the time, asked him to act as go-between to broker the current NI agreement that brought peace there? No of course you didn't cos truth doesn't feature in the agenda<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody just told me I was "illegible" when they meant I was "eligible!" Funnily enough I think judging by their interaction skills I was actually "invisible!" #CustomerService ain't what it was!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Adam_Townsend Well done for highlighting it! Sad that its happening!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus They deserve the chance to see it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Thing is it's still really funny now - 70/80 years on - that's the sign of outstanding humour!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Ah well - I just love the Marx Bros too! Remember seeing Groucho in his later years on BBC chat show (Parkinson I think? Mid 70's) Someone mentioned Greta Garbo &amp; he looks at camera behind his hand &amp; says "She wants to be alone, I need a loan! Maybe we should get together!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @HairyAngus Oh but I loved Spike Milligan - just for you!   https://t.co/edLjpUHDCn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus I always liked Dave Allan - just sitting, chatting, observing, telling the truth &amp; being funny about it! But the Python stuff was a mould breaker, you're right! Goonish for a more modern world!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Lol - no but I understand that!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie @RyanPGlasgow @KarlBrealey Yes - that's my view too! Need to pick team accordingly! Started "wrong" last night!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie @RyanPGlasgow @KarlBrealey Yes - we let them run through us too much in midfield - so much came from there - no one closed them down!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanPGlasgow @Geordiebaggie @KarlBrealey I think he's been fine - except when he plays the odd bad pass when playing out from the back! Certainly not to blame for goal last night!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MPJKaiser @guardian Absolutely right! Do you remember when the reports were quality too, with insight &amp; analysis, so you felt you'd been there? Now, when there is one, its usually just post match quotes from the manager! Standards have slipped!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@talkSPORT In fairness he was 18 ffs! He played about 3 times and was absolutely awful! Lots of 18yo aren't ready for PL otherwise it would have dozens starting every week! What he has become is awesome, but you can't compare then &amp; now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke Yep - I agree! I'd have taken one defeat in 10 in August so not going to worry now! One defeat in next 10 will be 2 defeats by Christmas! Simple! What's not to like!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidKe30081373 I hope Austin does start finding the net but he still seems a long was off! And starting HRK ahead of him &amp; Zohore says a lot about what we have!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke Agree - second half not many teams would have stopped us - that's credit to Leeds rather than failure by us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthews_boing Yes - fair point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie We set up for the point! Always a mistake in my opinion! Then finish up chasing it &amp; Leeds were too strong defensively!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie Agree on both points!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We lack a predatory finisher, a taker of half chances, a Kevin Phillips or, dare I say it, a Dwight Gayle! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Transformed this half - looking very good! But credit to Leeds - defending very well! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke No, best used as an impact sub! Except, as you say, at Villa Park!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luke_millichamp Well yes....its an improvement on that! üòÅüëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great stuff from Johnstone there! But shocking defence again! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HRK has offered about as much as Austin did on Saturday! F all! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Playing with fire here! Won't finish with 11 if we don't calm down a bit! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those Leeds directors they just showed look like a scene from "The Godfather!" üòÅ #WBA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sarahWBA_x @Chaz_wba Bloody good job auto correct didn't think you were going to type something else when you got to the s....! üòâ However you are right....he is the best young fullback I've seen at club since Derek Statham! Highest praise I can give him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GdnPolitics @golwgymor And the main reason so many brexiteers give for leaving EU is because its corrupt? Seems that won't change with our current Tory government! A rose by any other name!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@magneticsparrow Yes he was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulLovatt2 Hard to choose today! Lots of strong performances!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very pleasing! Best all round performance of the season so far! MoM for me was Livermore! But plenty of others were close so I won't mind if people don't agree with me! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baggiedave70 @AshBurty That's my worry too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is some goal! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baggiedave70 @AshBurty Agree - feel a bit sorry for Austin - that isn't his natural role!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshBurty Yes agree &amp; I don't blame him for not  being comfortable in that role!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Strange one - we're playing ok &amp; look comfortable but final ball creates nothing &amp; Austin doesn't really hold ball up to bring other players in, so isn't offering much as lone striker. Hence, no end product! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@labour52rose Sadly it seems, the only "opposition" party currently keeping Johnson as PM is the Lib Dems! #JoSwinson is the problem!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Yes but the readers are just to the "right" - not necessarily as thick as the idiots that read the other two.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Yes don't start me on the collective IQ's of the S*n/Mail reading Brits! Believe everything, question nothing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Yes - I wouldn't be surprised to see him find a reason to declare a state of emergency &amp; impose martial law! The incitement going on to create civil disobedience or riots is probably intended to create a situation where he could! Then he has complete control to do what he likes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Good to see!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigManHughes Likewise - &amp; I hope we're back with you next season!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ksshuttle The Kidderminster stores a shadow of what it once was! Doesn't hold the variety it used to, dropped loads of lines, shelves half empty, too much is very near its "use by", fruit often going off! And Argos/Specsavers going in there didn't help! Still prefer it to Tesco's though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Scary stuff isn't it! Battle of wits imminent it seems!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Yes - I saw on here, a couple of weeks ago, the headline in the English Sun &amp; the Scottish Sun on the same day, about the same issue! Totally different perspectives! Remarkable!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@phoenixbaggie @BornToBeaBaggie @WbaFormer @WBA @FulhamFC @Fradi_HU *Johnston* - bloody auto correct!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@phoenixbaggie @BornToBeaBaggie @WbaFormer @WBA @FulhamFC @Fradi_HU In my all time "favourite" 11, Sandra - along with John Osborne, Willie Johnson &amp; Ally Robertson to name a few!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Because I've never actually met a Scottish fascist, I'm sure they must exist, but politics of the right seems rare there! England has had them bubbling under for years &amp; now they've been energised by people like Farage &amp; Robinson &amp; latterly, Johnson - its legitermised extremism!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Yep &amp; this was going to unite the country! The level of nastiness growing daily will eventually lead to deaths through violence &amp; it's much worse since Johnson took over as Crime Minister (whoops seems auto correct changed that - I wrote "Prime")<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus I bet Cameron never realised what a consequential can of worms he was opening when he had his bright idea to hold a referendum! 3 changes of PM, so far, &amp; counting, 1 GE so far, &amp; counting, &amp; probably break up of the Union with Scotland independent &amp; possible Irish reunification!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Fascinating....thank you for that! I particularly like the bit about Scotland signing a letter to extend Article 50 if Johnson doesn't!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kevin_Maguire 5th of November....how apt! "Gunpowder, treason &amp; plot!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaggiesRoger @thecentretunnel I think it was the best "home" performance I've ever seen! Valencia were a quality side then &amp; the way we played that night was absolutely stunning! The atmosphere has never been bettered, in my opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulLovatt2 @Hepworthclare Isn't, wasn't - would cover every eventuality really wouldn't it! üòÅüëç<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StephenWFLabour Absolutely correct!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenWFLabour Incredulous at this from the "leavers" - the suggestion that the Supreme Court has a biased agenda just shows what a thick bunch of opinionated, brain dead, idiots they are!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 Agree totally!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was a time when lying to the Monarch was High Treason - for which the punishment was to be "hanged, drawn &amp; quartered" - shame we've moved on!

<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 @panmisthropist But its ¬£2bn investment - Thomas Cooks income, lost to the UK economy, was over ¬£9bn - that's just one company! And much more investment is being lost with businesses planning to retract or move headquarters/operation into mainland Europe! UK won't thrive outside of EU!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@panmisthropist @stevebaggie1 Quite &amp; will continue to contract!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 @panmisthropist Fintech investment of ¬£2bn is a drop in the ocean in GDP terms and will "help" venture capitalists a lot more than it will benefit the UK economy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrettReylander @FParsonage I don't think any owner will need to "agree" to it will they? They'll be obliged to comply, it'll be the law, if I understood the statement accurately.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StevePope47 @garwalbion @rawls_heather They had a ¬£1bn shortfall in total - ¬£200m they needed was to cover a few weeks - not condoning what they paid themselves but ¬£20m wasn't the reason for collapse! All big companies pay disgraceful salaries &amp; bonuses &amp; their customers are those who fund it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamHingley @WBA3stripes @garwalbion @rawls_heather Thank you - the argument is lost once it becomes personal &amp; no one listens if you insult them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamHingley @WBA3stripes @garwalbion @rawls_heather Absolutely! I voted remain but accepted it was likely we'd leave, with a deal, after referendum! But to leave with No Deal is utter madness &amp; the damage it would cause us all really isn't a risk worth taking!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WBA3stripes @AdamHingley @garwalbion @rawls_heather No question of insults from me Phil - have a debate with anyone who stays civil &amp; I respect opinions I don't agree with but will always fight my corner with passion &amp; back it up with facts &amp; truth where I have it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WBA3stripes @garwalbion @rawls_heather Do you understand how a loss on revaluation after a takeover happens? It wasn't an issue of mismanagement, it was a change in accounting after a merger! Nothing to do with actual trading accounts!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WBA3stripes @AdamHingley @garwalbion @rawls_heather Believe everything you read in the press?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WBA3stripes @garwalbion @rawls_heather Their turnover isn't even ¬£8bn! Check their accounts at Companies House website<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WBA3stripes @garwalbion @rawls_heather Right - saw it at the time - what's your point?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WBA3stripes @garwalbion @rawls_heather Their issues were controlled &amp; managed - but couldn't overcome the change in the value of the pound! The CEO taking a big salary is peanuts with cash flow short term need in excess of ¬£200 million to cover! Since they pay their bills in dollars, the pound value drop is massive!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@garwalbion @rawls_heather But mismanagement by #ThomasCook isn't the reason! Don't think your other examples have ever been claimed to be brexit related! But crashing pound is &amp; that's down to Brexit &amp; caused most of Cooks problems!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@impactsteve I didn't make any prediction... I just said "could almost predict....!" üòâüòÅ  Seriously though, we did almost cock it up! Can't keep coming from behind! Slav's in game changes worked a treat again in the end!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett @ScepticalGospel @LibDems I think what any party says before an election &amp; what they might do with other parties after are different - for obvious reasons!

<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ Yes &amp; I've just got there now! üëçüòÅ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christinecole_ Sadly I think you're right!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett @ScepticalGospel @LibDems Maybe - I think if the Lib Dems said they'd work in partnership with Labour &amp; some "deals" were done over Tory marginals, a Lab/LibDem coalition government would be a certainty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett @ScepticalGospel @LibDems The chances of the LibDem's gaining nearly 300 seats is fantasy! I'm 100% remain but I wouldn't change my vote to LD at a GE on the single issue of Brexit when the bigger issue for me is to get rid of the Tories &amp; I think you'll find that's the position of more Labour than not!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it  just me or is that EU flag getting visibly bigger? #marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScepticalGospel But vote LibDem &amp; keep a Tory government - thats the realistic outcome!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4beertaps Yes - home form is the key to a good season - fortress at home &amp; the points away are the bonus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@0Calamity @McgrottyJock @SkyNews Quite! The media have made the last 3 years about Corbyn - it isn't, leaders come &amp; go! The Tories have had 3 leaders in 3 years! The choice is about the next government - 5 more years of Tories &amp; all that brings or a "fresh" Labour government! If only that reality was realised!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4beertaps Yes remember it well! Typical Albion!  Remember a similar game against QPR when Gould was our manager! They were struggling! They had 3 shots &amp; scored 3! We pummeled them for 90 minutes &amp; couldn't hit a barn door!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllAlbion Not a "home" story but...went there by train in 70's before I had car &amp; asked a guy near station how to get to ground! He said he was going so he'd give me a lift. Drove me to ground, straight into official car park! Turned out he was Geoff Hutt, their full back then! We lost!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClintM29 Since I nearly always get it wrong you'll probably be right.....and we should win easily....but the Baggies don't always follow the script!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Northamptonbag1 More years &amp; more disappointments that I can count... but wouldn't have it any other way really cos still love the ride!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClintM29 Which way though? I never bet on the Baggies! Costs me too much! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trevorbailey61 2-0 down tomorrow before we start then!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trevorbailey61 Quite! That has to be worth a goal start for them!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wezzaboing74 Agree totally! Raising game against the big clubs isn't sustainable long term! It's like playing a cup tie every week!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 Yep - second season was always going to be tougher for them but, you're right, didn't do enough to strengthen in summer - neighbour is a STH &amp; he thinks they're in trouble this season - reckons they've got about a dozen decent players &amp; rest are Championship quality!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Fletch__ Haha! I couldn't possibly comment.....ü§£üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@barryd19651 Gone by Christmas is they don't improve...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Fletch__ It's an amazing turn round really! Second season is always harder than first but the fade out is much greater than expected!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Richbaggies Quite! Can't help smiling though, can we!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was impressed by Wolves last season (hard to say for a #WBA fan) but they're a shadow of that this season! Look very poor - defending is shocking! #wolbra<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Darren Stevens has had a remarkable game for #superkent by any standards - never fails to deliver! Come on @KentCricket - give him another 12 month contract! He's still worth it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray For a time, until Godden exceeded him, he held the record for unbroken consecutive appearances for Baggies! 160+ I think? Remarkable for a hard tackling defender - never injured, never suspended in 4 seasons! Absolute quality! And he could play a bit too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray Agree! Of all the players I've watched in my time supporting Baggies, he'd be in my team of "all time favourites!" In a different time, he'd have been a fixture for Scotland for years! Great player (not over used in his case) &amp; a really top bloke!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KrysiaJ @JoshuaFunnell2 The problems really go back to Thatcher who turned NHS into a "market" &amp; brought in external, non- NHS managers!

<|startoftext|>Subtle manipulation through clever spin gets into people's minds &amp; may influence their opinion!

<|startoftext|>@CF_Jones I've been to over 80 current league grounds, but I've never been there! For some reason I've always had a soft spot for Rochdale - I'll have to make a special effort &amp; make the trip!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@agitatedgoose @AngelaRayner @tynecat67 Exactly - and "if" she is telling the truth &amp; it was an "accident" then it's her mistake and she's incompetent &amp; not fit to hold high office. So, either way, she should resign!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngelaRayner @tynecat67 With a team of Civil Servants drawing up the paper work, which they'd have had checked by lawyers, there is no way flaunting the law was an "accident!" As Minister responsible, she signed the documents &amp; should resign!<|endoftext|>

Knocking other people over isn't "scenes" or "limbs!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adam_Townsend @jahwibble Have to say, I agee! Baggies fan near me got flattened &amp; quite badly hurt at Forest when we scored - needed first aid treatment! Mates dad in his 80's, but no wimp, (fan for 70 years) stopped going away because he was scared of goal celebrations flattening him! Shouldn't happen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure how #superkent will replace Darren Stevens next season? He always seems to "pull one out" when it's most needed - despite being about 90! Great county servant! üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RainerBurg2 @JamesMelville Absolutely correct - I spent years promoting UK overseas trade from within government &amp; so many who favour Brexit understand so little about the realities of world trade!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pennwba @mrspennwba The yolk is obviously on you then! üòú<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesMelville The "free trade" that Tim Martin champions, of course, is trade on WTO terms, which actually imposes tariffs with all those countries we currently have tariff free trade with in the single market! So it isn't "free trade" at all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVan Seems like that might be on the cards!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVan Quite - too much success too soon - they thought they'd arrived!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizJRudd ü§£ well things like this don't happen that often so he's probably entitled to have a shout.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVan Said to my Wolf neighbour in summer, second season would be a lot tougher than last.....and they could do without being in Europe this season, it's a distraction! Interesting times ahead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man City defending tonight is appalling! Very unusual! Credit to Norwich though, for punishing them! #NORMCI<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WhallopAOTS @BearwoodBloke @jslovechild We had a midfield of Hunt, Mackenzie, Owen &amp; Thomas when he arrived, all decent players - I don't think any of them ever actually started a game for him!

<|startoftext|>@AWaters1992 It isn't the EU that will cause it! The government have said themselves there will be shortages &amp; the report, which I presume you have actually read, is produced by drug suppliers who explain their position in it!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StephenWFLabour @ScouseGirlMedia Absolutely right! Another few weeks, a few more resignations &amp; his chances of surviving an election will diminish very rapidly!

<|startoftext|>@wba1957 @stevebaggie1 @billybassett68 Whose jumped ship? Heseltine wouldn't- he's pro EU. Benn (Labour so he wouldn't have got anything over line for Tories!!) was always anti EU &amp; outspokenly so in a climate that was pro EU - so he was seen as a "nutter" at the time! He was, however, a very clever man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 @billybassett68 Then we'll disagree - it's a pointless debate if you rate Johnson &amp; I don't! History, in hindsight, will decide how its viewed! And I don't care if you are a factory worker - some of the cleverest, most shrewd, people I ever dealt with were on B'ham Trade Council, union stewards!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 @billybassett68 And I worked for many Ministers of all parties - all of them were head and shoulders above Johnson in ability &amp; competence! For the record, the two most outstanding, intellectually, were Heseltine &amp; Benn - they'd both destroy Johnson in seconds!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 @billybassett68 Having spent my entire working career in politics - as a civil servant &amp; then 14 years as an elected councillor &amp; council &amp; party leader, I'm well aware of the machinations of negotiation &amp; the game play that goes on! Johnson desperately wanted a GE - no matter what he "knew!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 @billybassett68 Most of the country understand why Labour...&amp; the LibDems, SNP, Plaid etc by the way...have rejected a GE until after 31 Oct...that's part of the political chess game they're playing! So far Johnson is about one move from finding himself in checkmate! The worst PM in my lifetime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wba1957 He's supposed to be a leader - and as for being a "character" - that's no criteria for leadership - being a buffoon &amp; a clown doesn't really qualify him to negotiate our future with the world's top politicians! You have very low standards if you think he's a fit PM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebaggie1 @billybassett68 Oh dear! His best isn't very good is it! Have you watched his performances  in the House, he mumbles, stutters his words, can't string a coherent sentence together! He's shredded by MP's every time he speaks - even members of his own party have made him look appalling!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wba1957 Not giving a shit is exactly why he isn't fit to be PM. It's all about him, not the country!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billybassett68 @stevebaggie1 Quite!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billybassett68 @stevebaggie1 Agree totally! The reality, as it gets closer, bares no relation to the picture that was painted during the referendum campaign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billybassett68 @stevebaggie1 "......and little fleas have lesser fleas &amp; so ad infinitum...." comes to mind with the Tories at present!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @BBCArchive @Blairlodge Who said nostalgia is a thing of the past! üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCArchive @Blairlodge My uncle knew him well - he said he was, in real life, exactly as he came across on tv! Genuine, likeable &amp; extremely good company.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@terrywoneill Yes....no one of my favourites...ü§¢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@terrywoneill Yes I noticed that! Probably got a good deal with brewery for a big batch of late date ale!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is of little surprise to millions of us that #Johnson is failing miserably as PM! What is more worrying is that so many Tory Party MP's shortlisted him in the first place from a strong field &amp; party members voted to put him there! Just wonder what these people thought he had?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joelpetch A statesman, in the post he holds, would be above pathetic, sarcastic attempts at 4th Form humour! Unfortunately Cleverley is neither a statesman nor humorous! Gutter politics abounds at present!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnbreenlee Where have I said I'm impressed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 No comment! He is a "bit of a character" though, isn't he!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 I saw what went on in Sandwell a few years ago - when the leader that died was in post - thought it all looked very doubtful! Will look at the skidder! What ever our politics, doing it "right" is essential! I was Cllr for 14 years &amp; honestly &amp; putting people first was paramount!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 Sad the "used to" is in there! Btw it's a pleasure to have an "adult" conversation where we don't agree! So many now just get personally abusive or block a debate when it gets a bit heated! I respect you for not taking that line - I try not to - but it's hard sometimes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 I know Tom personally - he comes from Kiddie &amp; I live here &amp; was a Labour councillor here. I like him as a person &amp; I respect him immensely for his beliefs, but I don't agree with his current position on everything! I'd rather not put too much on here cos the trolls will start!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 Yes of course - because the way your tweets come across they seem to me to be very "hard right" - more so than just supporting Brexit! Words only give 10% of communication so by asking that question I got more than the words - your response was, for me, what I wanted to hear! üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 Thank you - we agree!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 And what's your position on Tommy Robinson - answer please - I've asked 3 times now! I'll take no reply this time as support?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 And by the way, in a 50 second clip, she spoke for 7 seconds - the rest was the Chair's waffle &amp; interruptions! She supports remain - so do I! The Labour official line is to honour referendum - but we aren't "put up against a wall and shot" for disagreeing - which us Johnson line<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 I didn't see it -  haven't watched QT in 15 years - I'm not going to comment on what you sent without seeing whole debate in context! I repeat - what's your position on Tommy Robinson?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 By the way - what's your position on Tommy Robinson?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IsMyBTBroadban1 Thanks for that explanation  - appreciate you taking the time! I've reached a stage where I don't read opinion polls - whether or not I support, agree, disagree with the data they provide!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 She has her position - she is saying what she believes! It isn't the party line but she isn't sacked by leader for saying it! Johnson is a moronic thug, braindead &amp; incompetent! He sacked some great MP's for calling him out! He is a fascist! You are defined by who you support!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ianrobo1 Exactly - so you boost sales by cutting prices &amp; increase volume again! The more ale he buys from breweries, the better price he gets it at - turn it over quicker &amp; it improves cash flow so that reduces banking costs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ianrobo1 Probably love it - it'll increase his sales so his profits will probably go up! Volume! Marketing! Never doubted his ability as a business man - just his morals &amp; agenda!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IsMyBTBroadban1 From a thread put up by a hedge funder? Ok - no spin or agenda there then!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthews_boing Frightening lack of understanding  - in fairness, the presenter got him off air fairly quickly without too much debate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ianrobo1 Exactly - anyone with half a brain cell knows Tim Martin (no relation - thankfully) has spouted absolute bollocks for years! If he can cut 20p now, its nothing to do with being in EU - should pay his staff more if he's got that much "meat" in his overheads! #wetherspoons<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some guy on radio phone in today saying Tim Martin was "knocking 20p off a pint after brexit - that's 7.5%. So the cost of being in EU must cost 7.5% extra on everything, we'll be better off!" Its that level of "understanding" that has brought us to where we are! Frightening!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cole_davesc66 Classic fascism! Keep the people poorly educated, poorly informed poorly paid &amp; in poor health &amp; they're much easier to control! Avoid empowerment at all costs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett @NathanielBayard @ronstanding @chrislepkowski @billybassett68 @wba1957 @LibDems Haven't voted in big enough numbers for Liberals to form a government since 1930's &amp; the chances of the LibDems changing that this time are zero! Trust Swinson not to help form alliance with Tories? I think not!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NathanielBayard @ronstanding @bfatchett @chrislepkowski @billybassett68 @wba1957 Quite! Get frustrated by those who parrot only what they glean from the media! Also can't believe that any sane person would really have a problem choosing Corbyn's Labour over Johnson's Tories as the next government!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Felix_keeps_on @curtislauraj @CorbynHope @lloydjody805 Well my "a little unfair..." was massive understatement on my part - basically implied sarcasm directed at the S*n - but you are, of course, right!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett @chrislepkowski @billybassett68 @wba1957 @NathanielBayard Don't agree with your implied supposition really Brendan! The media promote the agenda much more than what actually happens in reality &amp; if Labour had been given even a balanced press, they'd be home &amp; dry now - but the media is passionately pro Tory so the mantra is negative!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislepkowski @billybassett68 @wba1957 @NathanielBayard Exactly! Frightening what some people believe! And the same people will still vote Tory at next election because the alternatives are "the devil incarnate" because The Sun says so!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billybassett68 @wba1957 @NathanielBayard I'm losing the will to be honest......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wba1957 @NathanielBayard Honda's leaving because they can't be competitive in EU after Brexit if they're in UK because of tariffs! UK market isn't big enough for them to be profitable here! They came to UK in first place to service whole of EU!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislepkowski @wba1957 @NathanielBayard Stop it, my ribs hurt!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wba1957 @NathanielBayard And the countries we don't already trade with basically don't have a pot to piss in cos they're skint! So we give them money so they can buy from us! Stop listening to Farage's rubbish or the Sun or Mail bilge &amp; do some research! You're conned &amp; I'm sure you're better than that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wba1957 @NathanielBayard Give you an example! UK isn't competitive in South America - JCB were not competitive there - so they opened a factory in Brazil - cheaper labour &amp; overheads- betrer sales! No benefit to UK but massive benefits to JCB chairman's personal wealth!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wba1957 @NathanielBayard Sorry but absolute bollocks! I don't know what your job is but I wouldn't advise you on it! Don't preach to me on mine! Trade deals don't sell one widget - they just set terms that apply IF trade takes place! We sell to the majority of the world who want trade on favoured terms!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wba1957 @NathanielBayard As someone who worked promoting global trade for UK within central government for half my working life, UK global trade has always been with us! Look at the ONS trade stats! We already trade with all the countries world wide who want to trade with us! You really need to wise up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@phil_328 Why a full stop after a? Is the software playing up?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@curtislauraj @CorbynHope @lloydjody805 A media person once told me, they aim it at those with the intellect &amp; reading ability of a 10 year old! He was deadly serious! Little unfair on 10 year olds I'd say!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billericaybaggy @DeborahMeaden @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn *our choices* - whoops!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billericaybaggy @DeborahMeaden @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn Nor me with you, Ian. We are who we are, we believe what we believe &amp; we have those freedoms to exercise out choices.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billericaybaggy @DeborahMeaden @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn Fine by me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus What's the process in Scottish courts? Presumably Court of Appeal  next, then where, if needed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Judgement has been appealed hasn't it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizJRudd Trouble is grey is how many feel at the moment!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Judge bottled it really saying parliament is nothing to do with the law.....I've paraphrased that but you know what I mean!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ronstanding Labour shouldn't support an election until Johnson drops No Deal &amp; the Lib Dems agree! It isn't about not thinking they can win, its about not trusting Johnson to abide by anything he says - so scrap No Deal then call the election - not before<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus üòÇ it's a cracker! Hilarious looking on Twitter today!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChristineH_2017 But that's more about the gullibility of too many to media propaganda (manipulation) than the message from (or electabilty of) Labour! The same applied in the EU Referendum! "The press say so - it must be true!" applied!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidKe30081373 @jaksoi67  https://t.co/yKzjOhS208<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaksoi67 @DavidKe30081373 üòÇ Sadly that's what too many believe cos the S*n tells 'em so! I had more or less your tweet a couple of times from some who are deadly serious!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie @poulloingg @UKLabour 2/2 But I genuinely think that if no party has a majority, likely, then a deal between Labour &amp; 1/2 other parties could form a government with Corbyn as PM! Imho that's the likely scenario.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie @poulloingg @UKLabour You know it's a relatively small number of voters decide elections. Majority vote traditionally &amp; only a handful of seats ever change! So it's how "floaters" &amp; that's a lottery! So simple answer is, who knows? 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie @DavidpHearn There is precedent to vote on an issue more than once! May put her deal up for vote 3 times didn't she? So no reason not to revisit Article 50!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie @poulloingg @UKLabour A lot more skill in opposition than government though! Labour have out maneuvered Johnson - pretty positive opposition really! Even sensible Tories can see what a shit show their party has become! Incompetent, arrogant, disrespectful, privileged! I'd be ashamed to be a member!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The lack of political understanding, currently, by many on here is frightening! Corbyn doesn't support #GeneralElection until No Deal is dumped because if he does &amp; Tories win, UK still leave on 31 October with No Deal! Until last nights Bill is an Act of Parliament it's not law!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pguk10 "Don't want unelected EU bureaucrats running our country" was the mantra of those who wanted Brexit! Seems we've got just one running the UK now! People should be careful what you wish for!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adriansewell53 I hear Kate Hoey may be available! Vauxhall isn't far from Chelsea!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LizJRudd Lol - can't wait! Wear red!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nubasutra Gove I believe<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DavidKe30081373 I know, but I can't take adulation so presume there's an ulterior motive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getpromotionpr @magneticsparrow Would I?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems the Tory Party members who actually voted to make Johnson their leader/PM have contributed to the potential demise of both the current Government &amp; their party! We owe them a massive debt of gratitude! #everycloud #GTTO<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 @Eva_GBTheatre Bureaucrats only do what they're told to do by politicians! Elected politicians in EU make the law, like in this country &amp; civil servants/bureaucrats apply it! This issue here is a choice by UK govt - not EU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cllrfranoborski It isn't so much him that concerns me Fran, he is a clown &amp; a puppet, but it's the shadowy people off the radar who pull his strings &amp; feed him the words that are the problem! Something nasty going on - our freedom &amp; democracy are at stake here!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jemclay @StephenWFLabour @eddiemair Trouble was really that the remain campaign thought stay in was a given! But you're right! The campaign was appalling &amp; their media presence never really got across the reasons to stay!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenWFLabour @jemclay @eddiemair Quite - the referendum was so badly flawed as a simple yes or no! Far too complex an issue! Should have explicitly said that any deal would be brought back for "accept or reject" final vote!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jemclay @eddiemair Leaver said to me today "I never realised it would be like this! They said we'd get an easy deal  cos UK held all the cards and leave with no fuss, but those that wanted to stay sabotaged it!" I'm incredulous at his denial even now!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cabinetofficeuk @michaelgove I'm sorry Mr Gove, why do we need to be "ready" for something you sold as positive &amp; the promised land?

<|startoftext|>@shrimptony @AngieMeader Politics and religion don't mix! Poor judgement by Welby!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Dan__80 @molyneux_colin @JacobSt894 @alexwickham As a procedure of process in certain circumstances it is, as I'm sure you well know, but as a device to stifle debate &amp; impede parliamentary business its desperate manipulation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dan__80 @molyneux_colin @JacobSt894 @alexwickham No, because Parliament is the ultimate soverign body that decides! That can't be changed! That's the UK constitution! Do some research!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So for "rebel" Tory MP's the choice now seems to be, which is more important to you, the potential future of 65m Brits or you retaining the party whip? I'm sure many are watching where your priorities lie! #countrybeforeparty #NotMyPM<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@huntywbafc @B_H_Baggie Agree - unfair to single him if he makes a mistake - he gained us a point at Derby with penalty save! It'll balance out over season! Funny isn't it.. a striker can miss half a dozen clear cut chances but score the winner &amp; that's all that's remembered! Tough being a keeper!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@niallfgr Yes but we're "taking back control" so our parliament can make decisions for us again.....unless, of course, the PM decides he doesn't like that option! Most of us know who the "winners" in this are &amp; it isn't ordinary people!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WarwickHunt4 And he's been in it since the series started in about 1950...... a little talent obviously goes a very long way! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B_H_Baggie Trouble is a keeper can make a string of great saves, nothing, but one mistake that leads to a goal &amp; they're hammered! It's never really been any different! Remember the mauling Foster got for that game a Villa a few years ago! Keepers get abuse more than any other players. Sad!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Absolutely!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Lol - funny but also very true!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So we work hard to score 3 &amp; gift wrap 2 for them to make a game of it! Never do anything the easy way, do we! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brexit_sham @y2kshack Yes I understand that - my comment related to role in scrutinising parliamentary matters, not wider issues. But its accepted that the Speaker in his role is "A-political" &amp; to question him in committee could compromise that impartiality! I think MP's would avoid that possibility.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wba1957 @Rusholmerufian1 Malt whisky does the job fine - keeps me mellow - avoid tabs if I can! üòâü§©<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@brexit_sham @y2kshack I don't think he can! He is appointed by MP's and is, effectively, Chair! He would take his legal advice from solicitors expert in the parliamentary procedures! He is politically impartial on all matters! Select Committees scrutinise parliamentary business but not proceedings!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 Yes - actually do look forward to games again - last season started it, but this season I feel like a did years ago when looking forward to games is a pleasure again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 Lol - yep you weren't the first! Kent fan, for my sins &amp; over the last 3 games they've blow almost nailed on  certain qualification for the Vitality Blast quarter finals! Not amused!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveBarclay Funnily enough, "Just in time" refers to the way many businesses operate, not your new awareness of the problem or government planning for the issues that have been obvious to many for 3 years!

<|startoftext|>@DustpipeMark @PaulLovatt2 That's the European Court of Human Rights - we've been a member since the 1940's - nothing to do with EU membership &amp; doesn't end if we leave EU! Do some research!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulLovatt2 @DustpipeMark Quite - we aren't a member of Schengen so we already have border controls but we don't use them fully. UK choice, not EU! And we already trade with every country in the world who want to trade with us! ONS statistics, available on line! We just get better deal when part of EU!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaggiesBurger @Njr8691 @stourdave @BearwoodBloke @B_H_Baggie Issues for leave or remain are all speculation until we see what happens in practice! I've worked closely with EU in central govt &amp; I respect the views of many of the experts who are warning of the consequences of leaving with No Deal - mitigate before easier than fixing after!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 @BaggiesBurger @stourdave @BearwoodBloke @B_H_Baggie Apologies - it was rude of me - just had a row with Sainsbury's &amp; was extremely ratty! You got the end of it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 @BaggiesBurger @stourdave @BearwoodBloke @B_H_Baggie They haven't exactly stopped anything  though have they since the UK is now being taken to international court for being undemocratic! Makes us seem like a third world banana republic &amp; insults the Queen who Johnson put in an invidious position!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 @BaggiesBurger @stourdave @BearwoodBloke @B_H_Baggie The word is "as a remoaner" not "has"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 @BaggiesBurger @stourdave @BearwoodBloke @B_H_Baggie Constantly crying "project fear" or "scaremongering" is the defence of someone without a single fact to use in reply to serious issues raised!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaggiesBurger @stourdave @BearwoodBloke @B_H_Baggie @Njr8691 As someone who spends much time in Kent, I've seen Operation Stack on M20 when French customs are playing up! The plans are to use Manston Airport for overflow of waiting wagons! That's government planning because they see the real potential for a problem for trade in No Deal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaggiesBurger @stourdave @BearwoodBloke @B_H_Baggie @Njr8691 Until customs requirements &amp; WTO tariffs kick in &amp; freedom of movement ends on 31 October you won't start to see what the consequences are!  And the government accepted they will happen by contingency planning for No Deal! With a deal issues would be mitigated - that was the plan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaggiesBurger @stourdave @BearwoodBloke @B_H_Baggie @Njr8691 We don't deliver a brexit on No Deal because the consequences for the whole of the UK are too negative for the country to contemplate! The Irish border is only part of it! The idea for some of Brexit was to improve the UK - not destroy it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 @BaggiesBurger @BearwoodBloke @stourdave @B_H_Baggie Bit like her dancing..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaggiesBurger @stourdave @BearwoodBloke @B_H_Baggie @Njr8691 May was only there at the end, after others failed though wasn't she &amp; she did get a deal that parliament said - 3 times - wasn't in UK's interests, both some leavers &amp; remainers said that! The exit has to protect the UK - not just leave at any cost! What is the point of that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaggiesBurger @stourdave @BearwoodBloke @B_H_Baggie @Njr8691 The governments history of adapting software doesn't have a very good history - and on this I do speak with quite a lot of experience! It would take years to perfect a customs system specifically for Irish border! Certainly not by day 1!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 @BaggiesBurger @BearwoodBloke @stourdave @B_H_Baggie Is Anne Widdecombe your granny?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaksoi67 @Njr8691 @BearwoodBloke @B_H_Baggie Absolutely!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke @BaggiesBurger @stourdave @B_H_Baggie @Njr8691 And it isn't a problem of process - that's easily sorted - the problem is what "rules" are used!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaksoi67 @Njr8691 @BearwoodBloke @B_H_Baggie Bit difficult for people to say publicly  "it'll keep all them nasty "furriners" out, taking our jobs &amp; blocking up our health service, init!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 @Grippo77 @B_H_Baggie @BearwoodBloke Why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaksoi67 @Njr8691 @BearwoodBloke @B_H_Baggie I keep asking brexiteers that! Never get an answer - just empty, meaningless, Faragesque, rhetoric!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grippo77 @B_H_Baggie @BearwoodBloke @Njr8691 Absolutely - we have free trade with the biggest trading bloc in the world &amp; will need to negotiate a separate deal with every one of them with No Deal! A trade deal with, say, Poland is pointless if we have no deal with France, since French customs will control access at Calais<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaksoi67 @B_H_Baggie @BearwoodBloke @Njr8691 Quite - WTO terms stink - that's why most countries in the world strike trade deals &amp; form trading blocks, so they don't have to use them! We'll stand alone &amp; need new deals, individually, with every country we currently have a deal through EU membership with! It'll take years!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke @jemclay And MP's with vested interests in companies that have a bearing on their parliamentary responsibilities!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke @jemclay All I get when I ask why is "EU isn't democratic - its corrupt" - such ill informed ignorance!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jemclay Me too! 40  years of being inexorably linked &amp; some think just walking away is possible and we won't suffer extreme pain! Was in Kent last month &amp; roads from Dover are full of wagons from all over EU - we are reliant on seam free, uncomplicated, trade with them! It'll be chaotic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jemclay @BearwoodBloke Quite - the easily dismissed factual inaccuracies that some believe are reason to leave, I've seen on here, that are just media propaganda is scandalous! The gullibility of too many is shaping out future - not rational decision making!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jemclay Frightening Jem! These people decide our future!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie @kentyitis He wouldn't be seen dead on a train!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie @kentyitis Seriously though - isn't the country crying our for a real leader - someone who can be respected because they earn it, not because of the position they hold!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie @kentyitis North? That Barnet for him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kentyitis @Geordiebaggie It's only what we know so far... I'm waiting for someone to come up with revelations that he went to same parties as "a certain prince!" üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie @kentyitis That got stopped under the Tories here! Tory cuts - once a fortnight! You get it weekly - be grateful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kentyitis @Geordiebaggie And offered to help arrange to beat  up a journalist for one of his Eton chums...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie @kentyitis Its your right to like or dislike who ever you choose, obviously! Personally I feel same about Johnson - think he's a total prat &amp; Tories that voted for him can be included in my contempt! Trump is liked by the "right" in US as Johnson is here! Not many US moderates like Trump!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kentyitis It's hardly dramatic! Hitler was a fascist people recognise - fascism is dangerous if left unchallenged! Bumbling Boris is a fascist who plays on his persona to seem harmless &amp; likeable but he's a very dangerous man, as shown today when he's insulted UK parliament by his actions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie @kentyitis Irrelevant comparison! Personally I think Johnson is a bigger turd than Trump &amp; he's an unmitigated nutter!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kentyitis Yep - why not? People know who he is &amp; I doubt too many would have recognised Franco or Mussolini - about 4000 have viewed it so far &amp; your only the second to question it! So the offence level seems quite low!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 Quite - "conclude an agreement" is the requirement - not walk away without one! No Deal puts UK in breach of its agreement through Article 50! May &amp; EU reached an agreement that Parliament wouldn't agree to! That's Parliament's right as the ultimate, sovereign power in UK law!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kentyitis The comparison is about being a fascist - which covers a multitude of sins - could have added Franco &amp; Mussolini too - wasn't suggesting Johnson has committed the crimes against humanity Hitler did!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke @jemclay Yep! Irrational!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke @jemclay Absolutely - the narrative for the leave campaign was to scare &amp; persuade that all the countries ills were the fault of EU immigrants &amp; that by leaving they'd all go home and everything would be sorted! Little Britain!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke @jemclay Quite &amp; I think the xenophobia is probably the most significant issue for many!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 And I worked in UK civil service for 30 years administering EU funding for much of that time &amp; I can assure you the checks &amp; controls on how it is spent are a lot tighter than anything the UK Govt has in place! Most of the 2% of UK contribution comes back anyway though EU funding<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 Evidence? EU works no differently to the UK - the British civil service performs exactly the same role in UK as EU employees do it europe! Both organisations are run by elected members who are accountable to the electorate. Foe the record attached a break down of UK spending  https://t.co/7OnF8btar1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ONONERON @wba1957 There is nothing in socialism that says you can't get rich! What it seeks is equality of opportunity to succeed by your own efforts &amp; abilities - not by the exploitation of others! The elite protect their power by limiting opportunities for the masses!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jemclay Look at my timeline today - the ignorance in abundance (I'll presume ill informed) is depressingly staggering! Or its extreme right wing logic that thinks Johnson is god!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ONONERON @wba1957 Country*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ONONERON @wba1957 Ex Civil Servant Ron! Nothing to do with Eton! Party of the people probably doesn't want to see ordinary people shafted by elite millionaires putting themselves before the county they are supposed to protect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wba1957 That's not true! Housing shortages are because of govt policy since Thatcher forcing the sale of council housing under right to buy but banned councils form building more from the money they brought in! So mainly the housing built is for private sale &amp; is unaffordable to most!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wba1957 We've been in EU for 40 years! Only really had food banks in last half dozen - that's not EU! Most of those that come here from EU take jobs that need filling - they they pay tax - they contribute. EU is full of expat UK workers who work abroad - most will have to come home!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 But the "spin" was it would be with great terms that would be good for UK - not economic suicide! Tell me, what benefits do you believe UK gets from being out of EU? I'm genuinely interested? I keep asking but no one ever tells me! Taking back control doesn't work - after today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 They could have done that by not passing Article 50! You seem to totally miss the point that stopping No Deal doesn't stop Brexit - it just stops the UK shafting itself! May's deal was flawed &amp; rejected - why allow something even worse! Unless there is another insidious agenda?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wba1957 None of which are currently impacted on by anything the EU have done or haven't done - all are politically motivated choices made by the Tory government over the last few years - all are the result of austerity &amp; govt cuts - not by need but by ideological choices!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 Nobody has suggested not leaving &amp; many democratic parliamentarians of all parties who support leave have spoken against Johnson's actions! You may support leave but the precedent is now set &amp; next time he may force a decision that impacts negatively on you! Its dangerous!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 We'll agree to disagree! Suspension of parliament is the action of a weak man frightened of not getting his own way - it isn't leadership! Parliament agreed Article 50 - that was democracy &amp; meant we leave! Parliament doesn't agree No Deal so Johnson will force it - that's weak!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Njr8691 Not really - a deal that protects UK &amp; an orderly exit from EU is democracy &amp; would be acceptable! But a self serving fascist, dictator, thug like Johnson who can't win democratically &amp; has to resort to shutting down parliament to get his own way deserves calling out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Yes - quite - I stand corrected! The anti Nazi Germans deserved massive respect!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Often full with non-paying customers who weren't always there by choice....efficient the Germans!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Exactly - that worked out well!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cameron's EU referendum was "to unite the country" - May's failed deal was intended to "unite the country" - Johnson promised, on his appointment as PM, he'd "unite the country" &amp; 'No deal' would "unite the country" Now parliament suspended! What next? Civil unrest? #StopTheCoup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@garwalbion @SedenAnlar @AngieMeader @carolecadwalla @arusbridger @jessphillips @MollyMEP @GinaDowdingMEP @DavidLammy @LonGreenParty @Tom___Scott @natalieben @EllieChownsMEP Lol - yes I understood....üëç. I shudder at the thought that if we were a Republic, our wonderful electorate would see fit to elect Farage as President... or perhaps Ed Sheeran or Katy Hopkins or David Beckham or.....anyway...you get my drift!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenWFLabour @OwenJones84 You didn't see my tongue in cheek &amp; twinkle in eye when I wrote that! Twitter has its limitations - it doesn't pick up on body language!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People need to forget whether  #Brexit is right or wrong over this. The suspension of parliament isn't about the outcome, it's about process - UK is a parliamentary democracy through which decisions are taken! Unilaterally, Johnson has blocked that - that's a coup! #StopTheCoup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 @StephenWFLabour Where's Oliver Cromwell when you need him....sadly now Civil War seems nearer than it has since the 17th Century!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenWFLabour @SedenAnlar @AngieMeader @carolecadwalla @arusbridger @jessphillips @MollyMEP @GinaDowdingMEP @DavidLammy @LonGreenParty @Tom___Scott @natalieben @EllieChownsMEP Absolutely right Steve!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SedenAnlar @AngieMeader @carolecadwalla @arusbridger @jessphillips @MollyMEP @GinaDowdingMEP @DavidLammy @LonGreenParty @Tom___Scott @natalieben @EllieChownsMEP And a Republic would have an elected President who would be "political" &amp; probably a member of the party in government or sympathetic to them! How would that have helped stop this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agitatedgoose Quite - not pure Anglo-Saxon is he! I think he needs to prove his right to residency after Brexit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agitatedgoose A good example!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 @labourlewis Quite &amp; he also called the referendum, which he thought he'd win! Not sure he was the right person to negotiate changes! Wasn't very impressive!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 @labourlewis Likewise<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 @labourlewis I voted not to join in 70's when country voted join! But I shifted cos, whilst I don't really like a lot about EU, there is much we benefit from &amp; whilst it's there, we need to be part &amp; try to change from within! Isolation won't work &amp; harms UK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 @labourlewis I don't mind a good debate with anyone with a brain - even if we don't agree! It's when it results in insults I give up! Good to talk. But we're both Baggies - so we're sensible!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 @labourlewis And opinions shift over years - that's why governments change - don't you think that with the greater awareness of what it means now enough may have changed their minds to be asked again? And if the vote is still leave it closes it down once &amp; for all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 @labourlewis Btw - just to say twitter can appear confrontational sometimes - this isn't meant to be! If we were having a pint somewhere &amp; debating it in a pub it would be different but just cos I disagree on here doesn't mean I don't respect your views<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 @labourlewis Don't agree - if 250000 had voted other way status quo would have prevailed - Farage said before vote - "if we lose 52-48 it won't be conclusive &amp; we'll continue the fight to leave!" If we leave with No Deal it won't just be democracy that's the loser, it'll be millions of Brits!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaksoi67 @wba1957 That's why I asked it.....I'm waiting... but I've asked it before &amp; I'm still waiting....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 @labourlewis I'm likening him to fascism! Hitler came to power by winning over the masses by promoting nationalism &amp; a better future &amp; being the "good guy" to Germans - that's what Johnson is doing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 @labourlewis I'm "hell bent" on avoiding a no deal! If Brexit happens so be it but not taking this country back to the mess it was in in the 1930's - the self harm it will cause to millions is not an option for me or my family, children &amp; grandchildren! That's not about me - it's the future!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 @labourlewis I think you should do some historical research about the NAZI Party &amp; fascism in 1930's Germany before you show your ignorance any more! Google it! I don't need to, I already know...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wba1957 @jaksoi67 Answer me this - just what benefits do you think we'll get from not being in the EU? How will it make your life better? Serious question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaksoi67 @wba1957 Whoops  - that was Thank you! Bloody phone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaksoi67 @wba1957 That you - spot on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wba1957 But Parliament is sovereign! A referendum isn't a binding vote, it has no legal status or power in law, its advisory! Its outcome is for Parliament to decide how, or if, its enacted! That's the constitution! Johnson is the one ignoring the constitution by suspending Parliament!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 @labourlewis Read what I said, said it was a scenario of "what ifs!" Not too difficult to understand! And I don't see parliament trying to stop Brexit do you? They are just trying to ensure democracy is delivered by exercising their right to protect 60million citizens futures against No Deal!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wba1957 Democratic vote was a referendum, not a law and not binding - it gauged public opinion! The ultimate decision about how to enact it rests with parliament - that's the law! Now Johnson says he doesn't want parliament to decide, he'll do it! That's dictatorship, that's fascism!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 @labourlewis Corbyn hasn't been to the Queen &amp; only the press have ever suggested he would! He suggested &amp; government of national unity, as leader of biggest opposition party he'd lead it, but that required Gov't to resign first! Queen can't remove PM! So it was a "what if" scenario.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 @labourlewis The "spin" that was sold to people was that "a leave deal was a foregone given" &amp; the only person going to the Queen is Johnson to say "suspend democracy so I can get my own way" - that isn't democracy, that's fascism &amp; political thuggery.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 @labourlewis The vote to leave was about taking democracy back from EU &amp; giving it back to parliament so our democracy was in our own hands - not the whim of one, unelected dictator! And millions who voted leave did so on understanding it was with a deal &amp; don't support a "No deal" now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wba1957 *bugger* - not bigger - phone doesn't like swearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wba1957 The EU vote was about "restoring the right of our parliament to decide our future" &amp; at the first test Johnson says "bigger that, I'll decide what I do, not those representing the people!" You've been had, big time! Keep touching your fore lock to the establishment!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wba1957 That's bollocks! Democracy's about choices! If you don't respect that you're a fascist not a democrat! Johnson doesn't like opposition to him at present so he's acting like a dictator not a democrat! Which is what Hitler, Stalin, Franco etc did! Parliament decides not Johnson!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IsMyBTBroadban1 Which one? One of the two I posted...or my profile picture? üòâ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@robey64 @GMB Utter bilge isn't it! You judge people for the time in which they lived - not 50 years later! Hindsight is a wonderful thing - but not relevant to how it's used! I read #EnidBlyton as a kid &amp; loved her books, but she doesn't define my views now!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Sbaggieboy60 Quite! Thought Root &amp; Denly were amazing to pull it back in first place yesterday but it was likely to be all over at 9 wickets down - however that last wicket stand is the stuff of legends! Can't imagine stress those two must have been under! Stokes/Leach partnership a classic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seen some amazing sporting events in my lifetime but that has to be the greatest comeback ever! Fantastic stuff! #ENGAUS #Ashes #TestCricket<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Danniwozere That's hot! Keep the sun block topped up or you'll melt! Its 31 here this afternoon &amp; that's pretty hot so I can't imagine how hot you must be!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Danniwozere I can believe it is - never been to any part of Greece - sadly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Danniwozere It's only a number Danni! Its what you feel that matters! I'm still about 20 in my head....but my body suggests something else! ü§£ Enjoy your hols! üòé<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeHylton1 @CarryOnJoan One of my favourite films of all time - first saw it when I was a kid &amp; thought Patrick McGoohan was the most evil person I'd ever seen! Film is crammed with outstanding performances. Think it may have been #SeanConnery's first film? #helldrivers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Danniwozere Must be great to be 21! ü•≥üéÇüòâ Enjoy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If, yesterday, you had a #Test ticket for today, you'd have been feeling it wouldn't be used - but today you're privileged to be present at one of the great #cricket days that only come round once in a while! #Ashes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies @4beertaps @B_H_Baggie Agree - we had masses of possession yesterday but always seem to start playing "one/two's" on edge of box which teams deal with! Look better when we get in behind but still, often, don't deliver final ball quickly enough! I'm sure it will come...and we aren't losing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveHearsey @paullewismoney Tactics! You make sure it leaks so you can gauge public opinion before its enacted! If it gets panned, drop it &amp; say it was only rumour anyway - if little opposition, do it &amp; claim public support!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CulikOf @britainelects @YouGov Some of the English...too many... but not all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B_H_Baggie Think my frustration is the lack of variation from trying to "walk it in" - just feel we need to mix it up a bit with a few more early crosses - it's not quite clinical enough yet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CJHall83 Well said! He kept us in the game several times today &amp; no one should underestimate his contribution to the final result but good team performance all round - all played their part! @samjohnstone50 #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juice_journo @julesserkin @marmite @Tenterdensloos Have you just got up? It's old news now - game will be over by tea time tomorrow! üôÅ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@opposethe100 I've been a Kent fan all my life! Its etched in who I am! I have no interest in a franchise based in Southampton or London! Now living in WestMids &amp; being a WBA fan I'd have no interest if a West Midlands football franchise linked Villa, Blue, Albion &amp; Wolves - it's as ludicrous!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lott777 Agree totally! I grew up watching Cowdrey, Dexter, Graveney, Laurie, Benaud, Sobers batting all day &amp; teams declared on 500-4! Bowlers like Trueman, Snow, Hall, Griffiths, Lillie, Thompson! Test cricket now is a shadow!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@juice_journo @julesserkin @marmite @Tenterdensloos Very honourable....&amp; well spotted!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lott777 "As ye sow....!" English cricket authorities are obsessed with the limited over game now cos Sky love it &amp; want it done &amp; dusted in a few hours! Current players don't have what it takes for test cricket anymore! Two totally different games!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@julesserkin @marmite @Ken_W_Lloyd That's fine - unless the film gets exciting &amp; you drop it &amp; get it all over the sheets!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@julesserkin @juice_journo @marmite @Tenterdensloos Probably wiser not to engage too much with a Aussie this morning with England currently 46-6 in the #ENGAUS #testmatch! It's what might offer a "free hit!" ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juice_journo @julesserkin @marmite Can get both....Marmite favourite by choice! üòú<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@julesserkin @marmite @Ken_W_Lloyd Yes - iconic is an overused description theses days for things that seldom are! But Marmite is truly iconic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@julesserkin @marmite My eldest daughter has #gluten allergy too - she has #glutenfree bread if she fancies toast - have to find a way to eat #marmite!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@julesserkin @marmite Here you are... if you like Marmite, you'll enjoy this - gooey (in a nice way) &amp; crunchy with the underlying taste of Marmite! Been available for about 4 months now, I think.  https://t.co/jHFWPfe165<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Sbaggieboy60 You could be right! Aussies can usually deal with real pace!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sbaggieboy60 Me too! Love anything really savory! But I don't think you can acquire a taste for it if you don't initially like it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Testmatch - 4 slips &amp; a gully! Great to see! Proper #cricket<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@getpromotionpr @marmite Yes I was nervous about it too, but if you like peanut butter &amp; @marmite it works well - and the peanut butter is crunchy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sbaggieboy60 Marmite baby me! Love it! I'll eat anything covered in it....within reason! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just tried @marmite flavoured peanut butter! Delicious! I'm hooked!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Minor parties have a "spokesperson"  on parliamentary  cabinet issues - not a "Shadow Minister!" But most sensible people already understand that! Seems the #LibDems are poorly informed - but we already knew that! @FannyJan123<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@astlebridge @Stevotop @FulhamFC Just checked - no we haven't  - not ecen on general sale yet - only to Away ST holders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@astlebridge @Stevotop @FulhamFC Actually don't think we have - tickets have only been on sale about 48hrs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stevotop @FulhamFC No financial benefit to Baggies though is it - it only benefits Fulham! Morally indefensible when games on tv at 12.30 &amp; ¬£35 is a rip off in Championship for tv game!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bartlebee24_ @B_H_Baggie @FulhamFC I probably looked at price with ¬£5 off with away season ticket!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B_H_Baggie Then we've got QPR on tv at 12.30 - we'll see what they charge!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B_H_Baggie @FulhamFC May be wrong but I thought Derby was ¬£25? However it's much more easily (&amp; cheaper) got to for early ko than Fulham, so more demand from Baggies for tickets - not justification but still a much cheaper day out than London!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know this is often the subject of debate...but @FulhamFC charging Baggies travelling fans ¬£35 for a 12.30ko on Sky is a rip off! Come on guys get real #twentyisplenty #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jastle68 I'm warming to him - big, strong, improving every game - I think he'll be fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoodWBA Most people round me thought we should have gone 2 up front when we went behind but I don't think Austin has 90mins in him yet - still needs a few more games to get fully fit imo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Government can cancel #HS2 &amp; reintroduce stagecoach services instead! It'll please Rees-Mogg - certainly a step in the right direction for the "rights" master plan! #backto1800's<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnson as PM wouldn't be a problem for the country if a majority of Tory Party members who voted for him hadn't thought he was the best they had! Realistically however, they could have speeded the final demise of this awful party....so every cloud...! #GTTO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Darren Stevens may be "ancient" &amp; retiring at the end of season but he still delivers! #superkent #legend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ManorFarmWotton @rattycastle @doitinwellies @NFUtweets @BBCBreakfast @Almac58 @Minette_Batters @essexpeasant @HertsFarmer Yes I agree - I'm horrified where some produce comes from - probably by air! As a kid, I don't remember eating, for example, tomatoes all year round! Perhaps a rude awakening by some unavailability is what consumers need?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ManorFarmWotton @rattycastle @doitinwellies @NFUtweets @BBCBreakfast @Almac58 @Minette_Batters @essexpeasant @HertsFarmer Fine, but 40% dependence on food imports is still significant in meeting normal demand. Also fresh food produced at home is seasonal &amp; continued supply is covered by imported "out of season" produce, so the volume imported is still a major concern.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"50% of the food we consume is home produced" isn't the issue! 50% of the food we consume is imported is! #BBCFarmingFocus #bbcbreakfast #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @mac123_m @xpressanny Quite - common government ploy - leak something nasty to stir people up, then "mellow" it down &amp; say "we listened to you, aren't we good!" Original objective achieved!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@phoenixbaggie @newdiorama @LittleChickFilm Thanks Sandra - they've performed it at the Mac &amp; twice in Nottingham but London was the real acid test! I was probably more nervous than her but it was really well received &amp; a few "important" people in audience too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No sure about these #LCFC shirts....! #MOTD2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_Simonian Yep - agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Simonian Correct and he's badly exposed too often! Foster was special by any standards, international quality, but people mustn't forget he also mainly played behind the likes of Mcauley, Olsson, Evans - all outstanding at their best &amp; they built up an understanding!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Simonian I was a keeper at a decent, top, non league level, so keepers union dictates I never slag off other keepers. Johnstone is decent but sometimes slow to react, but he is currently the better of the choices we have. Doesn't deserve the criticism he gets!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Yes - allegedly also said "if you tell the same lie often enough people believe it!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Agree totally! Lost all credibility on political issues a long time ago! Who was it said "if you control the media, you control the people" - or something like that?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@10from61 @Satiresocialist @ABCBetterWorld @tom_watson @peoplesvote_uk @jo_swinson @CarolineLucas @NicolaSturgeon And for the record, I'm old enough to have voted NOT to join when we were asked in the 1970's - and joined - but I changed my mind, mainly cos i think if it's there we're better part of it than the alternatives on offer! Still not a big fan of EU but take it over US etc!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@10from61 @Satiresocialist @ABCBetterWorld @tom_watson @peoplesvote_uk @jo_swinson @CarolineLucas @NicolaSturgeon No of course not - if we'd have left quickly with a decent deal it would have been done &amp; dusted, but the risks of no deal &amp; the realistic possibility that significant numbers may have changed their minds requires that, for democracies sake, the question is asked again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@10from61 @Satiresocialist @ABCBetterWorld @tom_watson @peoplesvote_uk @jo_swinson @CarolineLucas @NicolaSturgeon So when's the next time for EU decision then? This year, sometime, never? However, this debate between us is a little pointless since I'm remain &amp; I'm right &amp; you're leave &amp; you're right, so we'll never agree - but I have quite enjoyed the spat with you! Good afternoon. üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@10from61 @Satiresocialist @ABCBetterWorld @tom_watson @peoplesvote_uk @jo_swinson @CarolineLucas @NicolaSturgeon They are not allowed to be councillors - they offer themselves as for election as candidates &amp; voters choose between them - then, if they don't like them, next time, they choose someone else! That's called democracy - the right to change your mind!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@10from61 @Satiresocialist @ABCBetterWorld @tom_watson @peoplesvote_uk @jo_swinson @CarolineLucas @NicolaSturgeon And for the record, your snide comment about expenses is unworthy since I never actually  claimed expenses in 14 years as a councillor - so don't be judgemental or make presumptions!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@10from61 @Satiresocialist @ABCBetterWorld @tom_watson @peoplesvote_uk @jo_swinson @CarolineLucas @NicolaSturgeon Relevance? The point is no election is a "one off". It is regularly revisited because opinion changes! The failure of Govt to deliver in 3 years suggests the country might like the right to confirm it's what it still wants! You object because you think it might not be endorsed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@10from61 @Satiresocialist @ABCBetterWorld @tom_watson @peoplesvote_uk @jo_swinson @CarolineLucas @NicolaSturgeon By your scenario there's be one vore - job done &amp; never again! What about the changing demographics, new people getting the vote, people changing their minds, the economy changing, world situation changing, alliances changing? So sod it, you voted 3 years ago - that's it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@10from61 @Satiresocialist @ABCBetterWorld @tom_watson @peoplesvote_uk @jo_swinson @CarolineLucas @NicolaSturgeon Quite. I've was elected 3 times as a cllr &amp; every 4 years had to stand for re-election so the electorate could choose again. Eventually they didnt! It's called democracy &amp; the freedom to change your mind! Opinions aren't finite or cast in stone. You've never changed your mind?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@10from61 @Satiresocialist @ABCBetterWorld @tom_watson @peoplesvote_uk @jo_swinson @CarolineLucas @NicolaSturgeon So they vote once &amp; you never ask them again?  Ever....ever...!

<|startoftext|>@10from61 @Satiresocialist @ABCBetterWorld @tom_watson @peoplesvote_uk @jo_swinson @CarolineLucas @NicolaSturgeon Of course I do! Don't be judgemental  &amp; see my reply sent before I saw yours!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Satiresocialist @ABCBetterWorld @10from61 @tom_watson @peoplesvote_uk @jo_swinson @CarolineLucas @NicolaSturgeon Yes but that was 3 years ago and people have a right to change their minds &amp; be asked if it's still what they want! Opinions shift, otherwise we would always have the same government! Scotland voted to stay in UK last time.. would they again? Probably not? Are they stuffed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@karl_trotsky @xpressanny @skwawkbox Seems some #Tories, with a sense of public duty &amp; putting country first, have more honour &amp; backbone than all of the "party first" #LibDems! Who'd have thought it....there again...!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABCBetterWorld @Satiresocialist @10from61 @tom_watson @peoplesvote_uk @jo_swinson @CarolineLucas @NicolaSturgeon You go for #PeoplesVote because Labour accepted the will of majority in  first #Referendum - therefore would accept will of majority in #SecondReferendum - its called democracy - respect the will of the people who have the right to change their mind!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@roadrep1947 Partly agree! First half I thoroughly enjoyed but after we scored we slowed game down too much, sat deeper and were far too square with our passing!

<|startoftext|>@Biblioate @WBA And a true, traditional Black Country beer would be Mild, not Lager!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@magneticsparrow Yes we scored &amp; switched off after that for 20 minutes. Seemed to think the job was done!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Knowing how Albion love a banana  skin, that was definitely potentially one today! I saw us losing 1-0, so I'm quite pleased with the draw!  Did enough to win but need a bit more directness in final third! Tried to "walk it in" a bit too much, imho! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maryrhodestv @WBA Think it will open shortly! I've been in before Saturday games several times - people often collect pre-ordered tickets on the day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett @mark_rollason @tardellie Absolutely correct - I think we will have a decent season but with so manu additions I don't expect us to hit the ground running!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Haha....Priorities....!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Curious isn't what describes my feelings adequately.... I'm terrified! üòß<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mark_rollason @tardellie Too many see every match as black or white! Every win doesn't signal promotion &amp; every loss doesn't mean failure! Patience &amp; balance isn't in most fans repertoire! I'm hopeful when this team beds in but won't be surprised is we don't get a result today!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RageyDave1 We've only spent on "transfers in" about half what we've gained from "transfer out" this summer &amp; our wage bill is millions lower than it was last season as a result! Can't do it again next season if we don't go up, but this window its sensible dealing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B_H_Baggie Quite - I soon gave up last season  on Adybadybyru - or whatever - &amp; stuck with Tosin - so this guy will be Grady!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus I think a ref within 2 years would be likely but if it was in favour of independence then leaving takes time, meanwhile Labour/SDP continue to govern &amp; keep the Tories  out! All "ifs &amp; buts" of course - but interesting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus If Sturgeon offers support &amp;  gets seats in government, Labour doesn't need to win seats in Scotland - the first part of the scenario is to get rid of Tory government!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus I said a year ago that Corbyn &amp; Sturgeon would eventually do a deal, discussions have probably going on for months, just surprised its becoming common knowledge before, not after, next GE! Would suggest if Scotland wants another indie referendum it's a good outcome! Quid pro quo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@impactsteve True to form for me! ü§£üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieldarby74 Lol! üòÇüëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WBAcambolia Agree totally! The signings this season have a future, may improve &amp; have a potential resale value! Gayle as a loan, I'd take, but not as a permanent signing at ¬£15m + 3 years wages!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jason29277552 Exactly  - and why the ones who come with low expectations from fans are often the best deals! They're all risks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevkeywba That thought had crossed my mind!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact most of us have never heard of Buksa isn't an issue for me really! Who'd heard of Odemwingie, Gera, Mulumbu, Olsson, Balis, before we signed them? Sometimes is the ones off the radar that come up trumps! Mind you, we've signed some junk as well! üòâ #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@malpmush656 @JPercyTelegraph @mattwilson_star Set the alarm to wake you up in 36 hours!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baggie_boy Quite &amp; many of those fans who highlighted this need at the end of last season were told there was no need to worry cos club had 10 weeks to sort it out! 36hrs left &amp; still not sorted! Can't say we didn't see it coming! #WBA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chrislepkowski @gavin_poulton @Algore1990 @jayb_1878 Don't doubt that - but high risk brinkmanship isn't always a good approach to successful business management!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gavin_poulton @Algore1990 @jayb_1878 Absolutely! Which is why you can already almost hear the club statement Thursday lunchtime saying no more activity this window with one 18 yo loan in from Chelsea or Arsenal! I know its cynical...but it's the same every window! We fall short, instead of pushing on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayb_1878 @gavin_poulton Club don't - they never do! But the rumour mill &amp; press speculation is totally silent &amp; clearly those in the media who are "well informed" have nothing to report.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoodWBA @gavin_poulton Agree - came completely off the radar - never saw any speculation about him before club announced he'd signed! Great bit of business!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoodWBA @gavin_poulton Yep - we really need a Gayle/Phillips type of "poacher"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A couple of days till window closes &amp; Baggies still "flip-flopping" around with no apparent clear choices in the frame of who they want to get! Squad is decent, as far as it goes, but too thin to see out season! We'll be sweating right up to wire &amp; then be told "we tried!" #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B_H_Baggie Lol &amp; Myhill...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShaneoTheBaggie @B_H_Baggie Ooh yes! Good shout!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B_H_Baggie Waiting for them to announce the re-signing of Barry as one of the 4! "We've got a young squad, we felt his experience would help them!" 3 more to go!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jasonphillips13 @lebouf1976 Agree totally - sad but true! Top managers &amp; decent players want to win things &amp; be at a club with ambition!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jasonphillips13 @lebouf1976 Yes that's my worry too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lebouf1976 Succession planning too imho! Bring him into club now &amp; when Bilic moves on one day, as he eventually will, Appy is ready made replacement who will know all the players &amp; staff! Good thinking by Baggies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>England are a mess when it comes to "proper" cricket! 20 over thrash &amp; run is one thing, but 5 day "test" cricket is a bridge too far for most of them! #Ashes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigdiscodave @WBADyl Albion's recent history suggests we just do enough....had we gone the extra mile last season in strengthening squad depth, we'd probably have been promoted! We're 3/4 players short still now! Hope I'm wrong, but don't see us having that many in by Thursday!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wezzaboing74 I thought that at the time but kept quiet cos it was all going so well......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IsMyBTBroadban1 @WBADyl London! What's wrong with Hill Top....?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigdiscodave @WBADyl We're in real danger of getting neither through indecision..deja vu! Can see the deadline day press release quoting Dowling now "we tried hard to get several deals over the line but didn't quite make it - but we're happy with the squad!" In other words - "we've saved a few quid!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WBADyl We've, allegedly, been on this for weeks &amp; now likely to lose out days from deadline! WHU will sort it in 24hrs if they are really keen! We still have #faffing down to a fine art! #WBA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JamesMelville I'd see it as a jibe at the "Little Britain" English &amp; hardly racist! Was a time when the UK had a sense of humour, but seems laughing at ourselves is consigned to history - very sad! More important "racist" issues to address than stressing about the name of a restaurant!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We couldn't sign Gayle because Newcastle wanted a permanent deal &amp; fee plus 3 years wages were too expensive! Bruce now seems ok about him leaving on loan so shouldn't we be looking to make it happen since loan fee &amp; 1 years wages are affordable! I bet he'd jump at chance! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ultimately last season we missed promotion because we lacked real depth in the squad when injuries &amp; suspensions took their toll. We need that extra depth this season to ensure history doesn't repeat itself! Biliƒá knows it - hope we back him with those signings this week! #wba<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@corinnebailey @martincroom However, it isn't to suggest that "off radar" agreement aren't already being made in private for by-elections. Politics is like icebergs - the public only see what's visible - most isn't!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@corinnebailey @martincroom At this stage leading up to a likely GE, any party will publicly say they aren't up for "deals" with others!

<|startoftext|>@woodford_simon He'll do ok! He's young &amp; still learning &amp; improving. Clearly has talent &amp; skill - his weakness for us was tendency to make a silly mistake &amp; let it affect his game. If he cuts that out he'll be fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie Point is, though, he will get funding to the limits allowed to a candidate in a GE through his CLP/National Party contribution like all candidates. Crowd funding is likely to take him over spending limits - returns of expenses/funding source have to go to Electoral Comm after GE!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie Think the question that needs asking, significantly, is why the Deputy Leader thinks he won't get enough campaign funding from the party, like all other parliamentary candidates will, &amp; how that can be equated with election rules on his campaign spending limit? Very smelly, this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FLeagueWorld @SkyFootball Probably ¬£8/10m to most clubs, but to Villa ¬£25m! üòú Seriously though - he's terribly injury prone &amp; is a huge risk for anyone paying a big fee!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PaulLovatt2 Quite!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stevotop Quite - perfectly summed up in 6 words!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke @TonksMD They're not - but an agent can't offer their player - or other club approach them - until they are 6 months from the end of current contract! Those are the international FIFA rules as I understand them!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@baggiestex @bartlebee24_ @TonksMD Relativies really - Swiss Super League is on a par with other 2nd tier Euro leagues....Championship level! And if his only reason for moving is more money, not ambition or needing a fresh challenge, then perhaps better avoided.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bartlebee24_ @TonksMD If money is the only driver he has it's a sad world! A fresh challenge, playing in a different country, a chance to move on to PL with us or eventually someone else in UK! And no one said it was for same money anyway - the reason was he wanted twice what he is currently on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@huntywbafc @mark_rollason @BearwoodBloke @TonksMD Yep seems a decent target! But I don't think any agent worth the name will say his opening contract demands are "take it or leave it" - that gets nowhere! Negotiations seek a deal acceptable to both sides - if Baggies have pulled out then that compromise clearly can't be reached!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Richbaggies Lol - so who is the potential new signing at the front! He looks like he has "attitude!" ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke @TonksMD And I think with a player still under contract you need current clubs agreement to speak to him or its "tapping up" isn't it - so fee probably near to agreement before agent involved?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke @TonksMD I think the "media suggestion" was a fee was agreed between clubs but player (agent) wanted double what he's currently on - so Baggies pulled the plug!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TonksMD Quite - I'm sure there is still some mileage in this yet! From what I know of this guy, which isn't much really, he looks a decent option.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And free to diabetics in the UK whilst we still have an #NHS! @NHSMillion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TonksMD Again - I don't disagree, but what he's on currently equates to more, in real terms, in a lower cost economy in UK that he'd move to, so double seems "over ambitious!" Perhaps a bit of negotiation might still be possible to achieve a "win-win?" It'll test desire of both parties!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TonksMD Don't disagree with you about higher wages in Switzerland to UK - but problem here seems to be, allegedly, he was on ¬£25k pw at Basel &amp; wanted ¬£50k pw from us! That's not Baggies be difficult, they'd have paid him what he's on, that's more about player being unrealistic!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Harryslaststand When a senior Tory doesn't fall in line behind, &amp; support, a new Tory PM, it tells you much about Johnson! Tories are extremely loyal to their own &amp; have to be pretty convinced they are not worthy of support to publicly say so!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @PaulSloane "*up* to a day of trolling!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @PaulSloane Trouble is, too many don't really understand how politics works! You do, I do, but I'm not going to open myself of to a day of "trolling" to defend the actual scenario that I think will happen! So "sl√†inte" &amp; on to my pre lunch dram!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulSloane He'll lead his party by their choice &amp; the country by default! He should give the country their chance to decide if he is endorsed as PM by calling a GE.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chrislepkowski @_the_a_bis @B_H_Baggie @BaggieFans Saw a report somewhere that Mings said he was so glad he was sent off at Villa Park because he was a "nightmare" to play against! The best he faced!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke @WBA Correct! "Off radar" signings have served us well! Big names inevitably have under achieved!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke @WBA Absolutely! A bargain at the price if it's a success! Odemwingie, Dorrans, Mulumbu, Gera all similar type of signings!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray @WBA @SemiAjayi Don't push your luck! I'm famously unpredictable - it won't last! üòúüòÇüòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie @WBA @SemiAjayi 19-21! Hardly relevant now! We've got whole under 23 squad that fans get excited about that aren't ready yet! Prefer to judge him on last 2 years at Rotherham!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was at a union summer school at Ruskin College, Oxford, with several who eventually went on to great things, watching shadowy pictures on a b&amp;w tv (&amp; very pissed) - one of life's most memorable moments! So much hope, so much positivity then - where did it go? #MoonLanding50<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray @WBA @SemiAjayi Yep - we'll see won't we - but signings like this are a risk/punt worth taking!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WBA @SemiAjayi Really pleased with this signing - doesn't always happen with me but we've bought a player still on the way up, improving &amp; yet to peak! Beats a free "old un" past his best with a dodgy injury record! Need a lie down after all that positivity! ü§£ü§£ #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pennwba Yes - I did, of course, type "wouldn't pay his petrol money" but phone knew best!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pennwba He's walking down! Jenkins would pay his petrol money! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StigsWBACousin "Mafeking has been relieved!" - #justsaying üòâüëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jastle68 Lol - my brain died I think!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jastle68 Whoops  - *which says a lot* was what I meant to say!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jastle68 How I feel too! ¬£8m is actually a "massive" signing for a Championship side! He may not have scored many in PL in a struggling side, but he could be very good down a division! Cardiff fans comments about him positive which says. I'm content with it! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevenwbaprince @JPercyTelegraph Quite - targets much different now than 2 years ago! This is our market!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gingerzola All 4 at once would be a start!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Baggiepat *think*<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@geoff_rollason @chrislepkowski @DownloadAlbion Lol - I did understand! üòÅüëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@geoff_rollason @chrislepkowski @DownloadAlbion Hate to say it....but I think its intentional! Wouldn't surprise me to see club get rid of training ground on a "sale &amp; lease back" deal eventually!  Worrying times!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's one thing working for a thug in a suit - we've all met them! But when the guy is a congenital dickhead as well it must be miserable turning up to work every day, however much you may love the club! Lai needs to take note, read the signs &amp; act! #wba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quite! Tend to think if we don't spend the money we are bringing in this window, we probably never will &amp; it will "disappear!" Suggests either the club is badly run or the owners are asset stripping &amp; recouping their capital! Either way it's on field we'll suffer! Messy! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pennwba Well it would beat going to Merry Hill! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizJRudd Yes, it's a good piece isn't it. I understand your mums view though cos I'm half Kentish &amp; half Cheshire, so moving here as a child was quite "interesting" but once I got to know the people the initial "baffled" feeling did go away. üòÅ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReynoldsRambles Yes - catches the character really well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray Lol - absolutely!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Yes - a good insight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray Remember queueing with my dad for Baggies cup tickets when I was about 12 (when you lined up all night!) Two lads were talking in broad Black Country accents &amp; my dad says to another bloke "What did they say?" He replied "Don't ask me, I'm from Cradley, they're from Lye!" ü§£ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a native born "Man of Kent" relocated with family to the Black Country when I was 9, this sums up why I love the area &amp; the people now! "The sardonic joy of the Black Country, where no one is spared a ribbing" #BlackCountry   https://t.co/q3WvEkDCFX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StigsWBACousin What textiles? No. I worked in export promotion in Govt for a number of years &amp; was responsible for textile exports so picked up a bit of superficial knowledge! Manufacturing processes rather than the technical stuff &amp; chemistry of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StigsWBACousin My O level chemistry pre dates the phlogiston theory! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StigsWBACousin Wouldn't a printed on colour run when wet? I thought the modern knitting/weaving machine use interchangeable threads in production, switched by the jacquard? But I'm a bit out of touch now!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@russellpinnock2 @pennwba Plus two!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stevotop @mattwilson_star @BombersBoots Otherwise known as asset stripping!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthewdmarsden I agree. We certainly need several key signings if we hope to do any better &amp; I'm not sure I have confidence in the club to get the right quality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@phoenixbaggie Lol - I keep telling people I'm usually right - well at least 50% of the time...!üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislepkowski @trevorbailey61 @jahwibble 12 "throstles" will be exactly that! 12 thrushes in Baggies kit!  https://t.co/qxXos9em56<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@montie @BorisJohnson Spin over substance! Hardly the criteria needed to run a country!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@billericaybaggy @WheelersOB Hope you'll enjoy it - gets a bit busy summer weekends but its lovely in midweek! I was born here but lived in Midlands since I was 10 so really enjoy coming back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie @matthewdmarsden Shambolic way to run a club isn't it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie @matthewdmarsden Quite! Staying optimistic but its fading fast....!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daiseyrai @WheelersOB Ta - we will! üòÅüëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daiseyrai @baggiecarl I'll wait till I get mine to burst into tears....but every bit of news currently coming out of the club is making tears likely sooner rather than later....!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The number of unforced errors has been shocking really at this level! #Konta #Wimbledon2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IsMyBTBroadban1 @matthewdmarsden Quite üòâ - in fairness, I did enjoy watching last season but ultimately it ended in failure &amp; it'll be a lot harder to succeed this season!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthewdmarsden Same thing happened in the late 80's after relegation - its inevitable - that time it took 17 years to get back and the way finances in football have changed, it could take longer this time if we have to rely on income!

<|startoftext|>@WestBromEL @Rachael_Swindon I met Jonners once at Canterbury when I was a nipper - he was with Godfrey Evans, who my dad had been at school with. It was GE benefit year!

<|startoftext|>@DomHill83 @mattwilson_star Hard to think of many that were "great prospects" in our youth squad at 16/17 who have actually made it in the last 40 odd years.

<|startoftext|>@trussliz @Telegraph "Let them eat cake....!"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ronstanding @TheRainbowStand I envy you being at that game! I've seen film of it &amp; I've got that photo in a book on Albion history written in 1963, but my first game was September 1955. Still many of the same players then, on course<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@phoenixbaggie @BBCPolitics Quite - she seems to forget that Britain made most of its wealth through colonisation of about half the world...and many who wanted their independence were branded rebels or terrorists!

<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie @politicshome Absolutely - I'm all for "light touch" government, but, in some things, it needs to be proactive &amp; public health is one! Not an issue to chose as a campaigning point really when all the evidence suggests action is needed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@stevebritton68 Quite - I think he just went through the motions last season!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @StephenWFLabour @sainsburys Heard about a M&amp;S getting a chilled delivery of ready meals from manufacturer - they checked internal temperature of van, it was one degree above what it should be &amp; they rejected the entire load and sent it to tip!

<|startoftext|>@StephenWFLabour @HairyAngus @sainsburys Yes I understand Steve - and just to add to my original point, there were strawberries on sale with sell by 2, 3 &amp; 4th so I bought the latest &amp; still crap! Heavens knows what the left overs for 2nd would be like! Very poor retailing - think how much goes in the skip!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @StephenWFLabour @sainsburys Quite - but Norfolk grown strawberries in July should be possible in edible form...!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenWFLabour @HairyAngus @sainsburys Not sure what the hours people work has to do with Sainsbury's selling a product fit for purpose! Others manage it! Still be shite, rotten produce any time of the day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus @sainsburys Appalling - happens at this store every summer! I should learn my lesson! Local Morrisons, M&amp;S &amp; others have no problems storing them ok &amp; selling a usable product!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizJRudd Wickhambreaux even! All those vowels together - confusion!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizJRudd Some of the villages inland from Dover are lovely - wonderful countryside! If you see a sign for Wickhambreax on way to Canterbury, follow it! Superb, unspoilt, real Kentish village - great pub (The Rose) church, village green &amp; water mill!  https://t.co/wAhUnD3QHV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizJRudd Lol - certainly plenty of those! Never ending stream!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizJRudd I'm in English Heritage - includes Dover Castle but not Hever or Leeds! Not sure what's in National Trust. Think Darwin's House is, but all the places in first tweet are full of stuff thats free.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kidderminster @sainsburys at it again! Selling strawberries with a "best before" of 4th July that are well past best now...bordering on rotten! This store has no clue how to look after fruit! Happens too often!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LizJRudd Lovely there! I love Romney Marsh. Rye is worth a trip as is Sandwich &amp; Deal ( can do together), Canterbury, Broadstairs, if going to Ramsgate &amp; Whitstable (my home town - but avoid weekend!) If you run out of options let me know! Lots more to do!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@teweybear @WestBromNews Quite!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@teweybear @WestBromNews I think he's a player that always give everything (too much, some might say) but I'm sure if he did join us he'd  do a job well. I'm with you though with the vitriol if feel - difficult!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baggiedave70 @Rondxnn Yep - today - about 20 minutes before they announced his replacement!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rondxnn When O'Neill was first appointed I got dogs abuse for suggesting it wouldn't last long! I was wrong...he lasted 5 months! This appointment probably won't get past October - we moan about Baggies but those running Forest make our board look class!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NatMansell Quite - obviously never heard of a seller's market....or dealt with Baggies when it comes to squeezing buyers pips when they want one of our players!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WallHallNumber5 @DannyGarbett Quite - don't understand how anyone could be offended or angry by this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyGarbett I agree with you - think the guy deserves a pat on the back - it's a fun event &amp; he's keeping it light! I'm sure if he'd needed to get serious again, he would have.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie @tom_watson There were anti Zionist's on the hard left in 1967 at the time of the Arab/Israeli war - it's not new &amp; it's not down to Corbyn! Also it's not anti Judaism, its anti Israeli government now, but the brain dead apologists conflate the two &amp; the right wing media feed it to idiots!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisjdownes Agree Chris. Labour are missing a huge opportunity by not at least presenting a united face in public! The media are basically in the pocket of Tories, so any chance to weaken Labour is a god send for them. The Tories are brilliant at closing ranks in adversity - not so Labour!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisjdownes @tom_watson Quite! The problem is the media love it so make it headline news &amp; undermine the party when it should just be an internal issue! The Tories have worse going on but keep it in house &amp; the media ignore it! Those in Labour giving it oxygen are feeding the problems not solving them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tom_watson Meanwhile the mess created by the Tories for millions of disadvantaged citizens goes unaddressed while you play internal power politics &amp; undermine the chances of Labour offering a better alternative in government! Stinks!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Daniel_Grigg @ameliamcd_ Quite! I am very pro Jewish &amp; could speak at length why. But I do not like the current Israeli government - it doesn't make me anti-semitic! I also don't like the current Saudi government - that doesn't make me anti-Muslim!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ameliamcd_ *me* - not my.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies @BombersBoots Just how I remember it! I sometimes mix my memories up a bit now....so that's a very pleasing video! üòÑüëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies @BombersBoots Yep - mid week game near end of season, I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BombersBoots Yes, it was the season Sneekes joined &amp; helped save us from probable relegation with a hatfull of goals! I seem to remember it was our first win there in about 20 years!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BombersBoots Remember a win at Leicester the season they went up under O'Neill! I had a quid on Baggies to win 2-1 &amp; Sneekes to score, at 125/1! We did win &amp; Sneekes did score! Think Raven got winner from a corner in stoppage time! I certainly celebrated that one!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Grateful for that! Anyway...did you have a great birthday?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus I don't! I want independence for Kent! Stuff the rest of the sods - William never conquered us! And you know I'm for Scottish independence! I see the Welsh are upping their game too! Brexit - taking back control...of what!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Britain is an island Steve, not a country! Internationally the country is the "United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Island". The fact that football teams play under different banners is irrelevant to how we're currently governed! Which is collectively!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IsMyBTBroadban1 Quite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Understand that that - but until Scotland achieves independence from UK you are still part of the union being shafted by this bunch of morons!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe I'm naive - but so much of this current debate seems to be about what will keep the Tories in government! Its not about what might be best for the country! #partybeforepeople #Johnson #Hunt #ToryLeadershipContest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cllrfranoborski Agree totally!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mark4WyreForest @HastobeHunt @JH4Leader @Jeremy_Hunt But you'd take a PM who'd deliver a "No Deal" Brexit that would probably destroy one of the most significant exporters in #wyreforest &amp; with it lose 350 key local jobs?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaggiesVault Only stood on Woodman Corner once - but what a memory! 4-4 draw against Spurs on Boxing Day 1963! Normally stood in Rainbow paddock in those days but crowd so big, couldn't get there! Great game - we came back from 3-1 down!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_mattf7 Quite, he was 18 &amp; clearly not ready for PL when he was with us! Arsenal  took that view too some time later! As you say - players mature &amp; improve! Most 18yo don't make it, but he has! No one was at fault 4 years ago!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daiseyrai That's 70 in doggy years! He still looks well on it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WelshDalaiLama @MoS_Politics Well, it certainly couldn't be a bad headache they get because that would presume they have a brain!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rachael_Swindon @declan_hoare This man wants to be PM - he should raise the bar, not lower it! He's life is soon likely to be open to world scrutiny - it's reasonable to expect that he should not offer actions that would "bring him into disrepute" - but I don't think he has that ability in his locker.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaggiesRoger @BornToBeaBaggie @WBA @ColU_Official @JeffAstleFdn @astle1968 @MemorabiliaMal Yes - I'd forgotten that Colchester - Leeds game! Agree, he was never really good enough for us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaggiesRoger @BornToBeaBaggie @WBA @ColU_Official @JeffAstleFdn @astle1968 @MemorabiliaMal ...and we later signed the Colchester keeper, Graham Smith, after his performance in that game! Seem to remember he was about 5 feet tall! (Well maybe not quite that short...) ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 This is one issue that really isn't about Corbyn! I know some want to blame him for every ill in the world - but this a mess that is totally self inflicted on themselves by the Tories! Trying to deflect it by mentioning Corbyn really isn't relevant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #Johnson is elected leader he may well unite the Tory party, short term, but he certainly won't unite the country &amp; division will continue to grow until there is a GE! So it really is turkeys voting for Christmas! #ToryLeadershipContest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NAJ562 @JohnHurr Quite - the highest office of state shouldn't be filled by the lowest form of life! #NotMyPrimeMinister #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So it was preseason game at Benidorm or Scunthorpe for me....! Decided on Scunthorpe..... life in the fast lane! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EFC_95 Not if you're a #Baggies fan! For every  loser, there's a potential winner! üòâ #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing against Millwall  - but twice at home in a 3 days isn't what I'd have chosen for first 2 home games! ü§£ü¶Å #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie @Baggie_Russ Early information of when to book holidays though - so they clash with games - so it'll come in handy....one way or another! ü§£üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaggieBird66 Sorted ta - but I was losing the will to live.... ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie @Baggie_Russ It's ok now ta - suddenly it downloaded a message into today in calendar saying "success"! I clicked on it &amp; WBA came up, clicked that &amp; all the fixtures down loaded! But bizarre does sum it up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getpromotionpr Very frightening isn't it! Can't believe how easily so many people are fooled! Difficult to see who can stop it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Success at last!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daiseyrai I'll phone the bookie!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WallHallNumber5 Done that...twice....nothing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie @Baggie_Russ That just takes me to the same Ecal link as the Baggies link - it just wont download anything to my calendar! It either says "all done" and nothing is or it asks me to confirm I'm over 13 (ffs) &amp; when I do &amp; click next, nothing happens!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hero_Taylor9 Did all that! Thought it may have gone into wrong calendar (a hidden one I don't use) on phone so I synced all calendars - that did nothing either!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daiseyrai That's spooky - supernatural powers obviously! Who's going to win the Derby?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Baggie_Russ Tried that too - nothing works<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Baggie_Russ Yep that's the link I used - it didn't download - just said "all done" but wasn't!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just spent an eternity trying to download #baggies fixtures from this #ecal account #WBA have put link for! Why do club make it so difficult? Never have a problem before, but now however I sync it says "all done" &amp; nothing downloads to phone calendar! Advice anyone?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ONONERON David Davis - for starters - other names are available...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>David Davis is a brain dead twat who failed big time at the job he was given! Why does anyone care what his opinion is? The fact that he believes #Johnson is PM material &amp; spouts it on #r4 really says all you need to know!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boris the Spider - our next PM?  https://t.co/HC21cs3dNP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CockertonMark @Qualitys_treat Very worrying Mark! Too many people still don't realise what's happening &amp; how Brexit will impact further on that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CockertonMark @Qualitys_treat First hand experience, Mark, not just through my wife. I was a Shadow Foundation Trust Board Member for 3 years, so saw the problem of recruitment &amp; staffing "at the sharp end" &amp; what agencies cost the Trust.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Qualitys_treat @CockertonMark Maybe if the NHS paid them a decent wage in the first place they'd be in full time employment &amp; not working for private agencies who bleed resources from NHS that could be better spent? And - yes, my wife is a senior nurse who works in the NHS!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DavidWoodydr Sounds a good choice! üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidWoodydr Lol - yea I've been found out....üòú<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnson is neither articulate nor statesmanlike. The others at least show some (limited) signs of talent. Personally I don't give a toss who leads the Tories... but I'm terrified for the country with any of these average candidates as PM! But what do I know! #BBCOurNextPM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@garwalbion @griffraces @BearwoodBloke @mattwilson_star Depressing isn't it? We're I'm limbo whilst he retains ownership.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Statesmanship (I use term since no women are left in contest) is sadly lacking from those who would be, by default not by democracy, next PM! Stunningly, from a party, who claim democracy is paramount in #Brexit, the choice of the few, not the many, will lead us! #ToryLeadership<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MinersStrikeOTD @annasilvani Some years ago I saw film of this as it was shot chronologically - then was shown how it was edited for media transmission on BBC News! Frightening manipulation in favour of the establishment! #battleofOrgreave #minersstrike<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke @griffraces @mattwilson_star Oh I don't know - there was a one off win for a Shanghai manufacturer of cheap blue &amp; white scarves! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@griffraces @BearwoodBloke @mattwilson_star He wanted a PL brand to promote his companies in Asia. It was a marketing tool - English PL football is popular worldwide so sell products on the back of it! Relegation killed that! Club is now irrelevant to him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke @mattwilson_star Quite - I also find Lai's statement about foreign investment needs scrutiny! A debt/loan between two companies in the same group/ownership isn't "foreign investment" - its an inter-group transaction by transfer of funds &amp; unlikely to be controlled by the Chinese rules quoted!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattwilson_star I find it hard to understand why, as part of the deal to buy the club, Lai didn't insist Peace repay the loan from the money he got from selling the club? Seems a poor piece of negotiation by Lai to me! Typical Peace though...all in his favour! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tom_watson The issue of #Brexit isn't a strict party issue! It's about how you see #EU &amp; UK's position in it!

<|startoftext|>@garwalbion @TaffieBaggie @martynware @Tazzaman3 @RoryStewartUK Never stopped Ray Reardon being World Snooker Champion! üòâüòÅüëç #Dracula<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darr3nHall @martynware @Tazzaman3 Yes I think you are right! I think this whole leadership/PM issue is about the party, not the country. That's not so bad if they were in opposition but in government it touches us all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie @martynware @Tazzaman3 Seriously, I have a feeling the balance will shift &amp; the anti Johnson support will polarise as the list gets reduced! I'm sure those who are going to support him have done so already! Question is, who'll be on ballot with him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfatchett @martynware @Tazzaman3 Yes I know - frightening isn't it! I remember a debate with someone a few years ago &amp; I suggested Trump &amp; Johnson could be President &amp; PM at the same time - I got appalling abuse saying I was deluded if I thought it could ever happen! I take no pleasure....! üòâüòá<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie @martynware @Tazzaman3 Oh dear - goodnight! You just destroyed your credibility - just vote for Johnson when your ballot papers arrive!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BethRigby @dr_shibley @SkyNews Perhaps it's a case of the anti Johnson camp in the party closing ranks to offer a credible alternative?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Very judgemental of him...ü§£ü§£üòâ @Kentishtrivia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robsussum @BBCPolitics I agree we elect a constituency MP who stands on a party manifesto! But if that manifesto changes under a different leader then the country have a right to endorse/reject that change through GE. Manifesto changes seem likely under most remaining candidates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCPolitics The Tories can elect who they like to be their party leader - who cares? But the fact that person, by default, becomes PM should be of great concern to the 99%+ of the electorate who have no say! Democracy requires a #GeneralElection should follow! #ToryLeadershipContest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie Yes I realised that - but you are right too! They do owe us big time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geordiebaggie Very long time Baggie - seen it all! Caught out before but still love the club, served my time so entitled to take the piss! But now looking forward - not back! #onwardsandupwards #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tend to think Baggies must have given Bilic some pretty cast iron assurances over budgets &amp; recruitment for him to agree to join! Keen to see our well oiled &amp; efficient recruitment machine burst into action now to back him! #WBA  https://t.co/GmHi4ra6Lk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomwba1982 @andyroberts82 Quite - Bolton didn't start in this situation &amp; the decline from PLto current situation has taken several years, didn't happen overnight! We need to be very wary of what can happen with poor owners, not complacent that "this isn't us"! It could be!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bazabaggie73 Me too! I'm more than happy with Bilic as well! üëçü§û<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bazabaggie73 Yea wait till 2022 - we don't know who might become available.... ü§£ü§î<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TaffieBaggie @isaby @RoryStewartUK If I was a Tory I'd probably vote for Rory.....but first..... üòâ  https://t.co/lGoA7LBCdS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pennwba What scares me is the number in his party (and wider community) who actually think he's appropriate PM material!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebritton68 Worrying the way they operate isn't it! Wouldn't be surprised to see this fall through. Hope not though because I think he'd be a decent appointment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebritton68 It was a newspaper report that suggested it, not me - hence the comment was in quotes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rjdowning @huntywbafc Yes, particularly since club already promised Shan a job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rjdowning @huntywbafc The paper report I saw suggested they've each individually got to agree personal terms yet even though, in principle, they'll join with him! All 87 of them presumably! üòÅ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@huntywbafc I was quoting a press report saying just that - hence my comment was in quotes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Surreybaggie Agree totally! I think many of these young players that choose to leave do so because they feel the club lacks ambition &amp; direction! They want to play for a club that tries to win things!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gavin_poulton There's a vacancy as Head of the Academy waiting for Shan if he wants it. There...I've sorted it...!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So it could take "up to a week" to sort out Bilic's backroom staff before anything is finalised or his appointment confirmed! Does any club faff more than Baggies? Meanwhile paint dries! #wba<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MAF79  https://t.co/WAj5gbdoxY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislepkowski @baggiestex @baggiedave70 @creadie84 Yes forgotten it was Saunders signed him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IsMyBTBroadban1 @baggiedave70 Yes I Iiked that &amp; we hardly wore it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baggiestex @chrislepkowski @baggiedave70 @creadie84 Yep - said he had no first touch! Didn't he score 4 goals in the 3 games he played for us before Saunders sold him? His only decent signing was Naylor really, the rest were lower league quality - although "quality" wasn't a word you could use for them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislepkowski @baggiedave70 @creadie84 In a word.....yes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baggiedave70 @chrislepkowski @creadie84 Yes that's right - I never minded us wearing blue shorts to avoid a clash away but hated those years we wore blue as first choice at home! And Saunders was one of main reasons we stayed down so long! He got rid of so many decent players &amp; brought some absolute junk in!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@geoff_rollason @chrislepkowski @baggiestex @baggiedave70 @creadie84 Sealandair coaches in those days wasn't it? And the team went by Don Everall! Funny what you remember really, isn't it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhallopAOTS @Sbaggieboy60 @baggiedave70 @creadie84 @chrislepkowski Yes we did lose 3-0. I thought it was missed, went out for corner &amp; Ossie went back in goal before corner was taken...but as you say, long time ago so need to check with John Homer! He'd remember!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@geoff_rollason @chrislepkowski @baggiestex @baggiedave70 @creadie84 I remember the trip up M6! Stunning!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamHingley @_the_a_bis @chrislepkowski @baggiestex @geoff_rollason @baggiedave70 @creadie84 I think it's in the days where clubs had a couple of sets of kits &amp; a lady doing the laundry! "These blue shorts will go another 6 or 7 washes before we need to change them!" We might give Jenkins ideas - better not say too much!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@geoff_rollason @chrislepkowski @baggiestex @baggiedave70 @creadie84 Yes it was - home team were in blue! Thanks - I wasn't sure which game it was - only saw snippet without commentary! Fabulous day that was!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@geoff_rollason @chrislepkowski @baggiestex @baggiedave70 @creadie84 Saw film the other day of Bomber scoring wearing it (with blue shorts) &amp; the build up involved Mick Martin &amp; Paddy Mulligan, both signed by Giles - don't remember wearing it before him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislepkowski @baggiestex @geoff_rollason @baggiedave70 @creadie84 Could well be true - it did just arrive one away game, mid season. We wore yellow &amp; blue before...which is why the green &amp; yellow shirts were worn with blue shorts for a bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sbaggieboy60 @baggiedave70 @creadie84 @chrislepkowski When I was a kid I kept a match by match record with comments about games, players etc! It disappeared in one of many house moves many years ago....I wish I'd still got it now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baggiestex @chrislepkowski @geoff_rollason @baggiedave70 @creadie84 Quite! I remember Howe saying in an interview "the most important thing in football is to stop the opposition scoring!" Then Giles came with his "they score 3, we'll get 4" approach! So refreshing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sbaggieboy60 @baggiedave70 @creadie84 @chrislepkowski Dont! I remember '68 like it was yesterday...&amp; that's 50 years too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhallopAOTS @Sbaggieboy60 @baggiedave70 @creadie84 @chrislepkowski Sure they missed the pen - either he saved it or it hit post! Osborne was limping &amp; as soon as the pen was taken he went back in goal again. I remember Nisbet scoring a goal against us from about 40 yds at Plymouth when he played for them a few years later! Only one he ever got!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sbaggieboy60 @baggiedave70 @creadie84 @chrislepkowski That was away at Sunderland! Osborne got injured &amp; Nisbet went in goal, saved a penalty then Osborne went back in goal - but at Sunderland we always wore stripes I  those days!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@geoff_rollason @chrislepkowski @baggiedave70 @creadie84 It was that "12 year old" ref &amp; a years rain came down in 90mins during game! Etched in my memory, that evening!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@geoff_rollason @chrislepkowski @baggiedave70 @creadie84 Yes but we had 2 sent off away there &amp; basically ran them ragged with 9 men! Very unlucky to lose that game!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislepkowski @geoff_rollason @baggiedave70 @creadie84 I liked the black one we had....but that didn't last long! Think we wore it the season Blackpool were PL cos I seem to remember Ibanez wearing one at his signing...and when he got sent off at Blackpool!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislepkowski @baggiedave70 @creadie84 Well 19 years after League cup defeat then, not 20 - but the point is for years the memory of QPR lived on &amp; the club avoided it! Still hate us in red now! Although I did like the red &amp; black stripes a few years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baggiedave70 @creadie84 @chrislepkowski In fact, after that defeat the club vowed they would never wear a red kit again! Had white, yellow &amp; then green &amp; yellow for over 20 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baggiedave70 @creadie84 @chrislepkowski Me too - reminds me of League Cup Final v QPR in 1967!! We didn't wear red again after that defeat until Gould was manager, when we had yellow &amp; red stripes! That was awful! Absolutely hate us in red!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jimmythewhack Wasn't it! Hoping for more of the same!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies @gavin_poulton Lol - don't!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpjdavies @gavin_poulton Playing well against Luton (or Cyprus) is no indication of his suitability against decent Championship sides though! Several we have out on loan in lower leagues do ok there but wouldn't hack it yet at higher level! Will he make it? I don't know but he really hasn't impressed yet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stevotop @JamesMelville People think satire is just comedy but in reality it is often real insight!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just wondering how Baggies board could increase the intensity of meltdown about slow managerial appointment &amp; decided announcing a red away strip instead of green &amp; yellow would probably achieve it! Shudders at the thought! #WBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheProleStar @MailOnline How the "mighty" are fallen! The self important arrogance of this man is frightening! Elected in first place because he was Labour, not because he was Chuka! Sooner he's consigned to history the better!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably blown his chances of being PM if he's banned from US! One down - 11 to go!  https://t.co/mDLOXeaerL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@garwalbion @TaffieBaggie @tim_spiers_Star @ExpressandStar You develop the ground first then you aim to grow attendances with other ambitions! Every PL club that has increased its ground capacity, has increased it's average attendance - even when they didn't fill it before &amp; even Stoke in a relegation season!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pauldashworth Understand your point - but as a youth in the 60's, I don't remember it being as nasty as this - the "love &amp; peace" society was pretty inclusive! "Love the one you're with!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaggieBird66 @pennwba And its Saturday - can't expect them to work weekends - golf in the morning &amp; lunch in the clubhouse! Priorities!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus It really made me smile<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus  - you might enjoy this....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very proud of daughter @LittleChickFilm on the premiere of her play, @AboutJack1, tonight. Powerful, thoughtful piece with loads of humour! Well done too all of cast, who were superb! Well worth seeing if it's on near you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SSWBAfan üëçü§£üòÅ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveWBA1878 Probably the Albion board burning their bridges....!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SSWBAfan Shame on you...all those carbs! Bacon &amp; sausage sandwich every time for me...with lots of brown sauce!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alb1on68 @Poorboy55 Maybe, but I don't think the UK government would be open to a trade deal that includes Australian health care providers..! US ones are a real option though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ianrobo1 @guardian The times we live in get more worrying by the day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurenWBA28 Lol - stamina training...!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ianrobo1 @guardian Not doubting that - I retweeted a newspaper report, without comment or judgement, in frustration at Hammond's comments, which need to seen! Clearly shows who his priorities are for!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ianrobo1 @guardian Quite! That's the point really isn't it! The needs of "businesses" &amp; government spending more important to the Tories than the future of the planet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SSWBAfan @ethanhunt1961 @6629nettis @BethBossy @CherylJoycee @bianca_lobsey @TINGLYTASTEBUDS @BethBefBuf Roadie....lots of free perks...! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rusholmerufian1 I think many felt like him when they've been involved in war.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KathrynLangran He may have found it difficult to talk about. My dad could talk about his experiences but my granddad who was in the RAMC in WW1 would never discuss what he experienced<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus The polarisation taking place in England is frightening - intolerance of any alternative to views someone else holds is met with increasing vitriol &amp; nastiness - rational debate is becoming very difficult &amp; ultimately collective violence will be the ultimate outcome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KathrynLangran D-Day +3 my dad went over &amp; finished war being part of the liberation of Brussels in September 1944 - he'd have been 98 in March. His memories of what he'd seen used to make him shudder!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus The parallels today with the 1930's, with the rise of growing hard right nationalism throughout the world, is frightening! And millions suck up the Brexit rubbish &amp; potential isolation that it will bring for the UK! Jingoism &amp; xenophobia aren't the answer to anything!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Quite!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus My dad was in RAF - he went over 3 days after D Day with his squadron &amp; finished up as part of the liberation of Brussels in September - some of the things he told me about what he saw were horrendous &amp; clearly stayed with him forever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaksoi67 @rjdowning @mattwilson_star ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairyAngus Quite - but hard to understand how they actually managed to do it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hearing all these elderly veterans with their memories makes me feel very humble &amp; very grateful! Such heroism that must never be forgotten! #dday75 #oneshow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rjdowning @mattwilson_star Yea they'll interview him when he's free on Boxing Day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattwilson_star The only club capable of having a bigger "short list" the longer the search goes on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulFulford @chrislepkowski @LittleBlackwd Looks lovely - but don't think we could do it credit needing to be at @mac_birmingham by about 7.00<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearwoodBloke @PaulFulford @chrislepkowski Thanks - I'll have a look.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulFulford - @chrislepkowski says you could advise? Early eats though cos performance is at 7.30! Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislepkowski @PaulFulford Thanks Chris  - I'll ask!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going to see my daughter @WhoIAmToday2 perform in her play @AboutJack1 at the @mac_birmingham on Friday! Any recommendations for a decent pre-show meal in #Moseley please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lott777 So long as the squad don't after training...! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarah_WBAx @Baggiepat Any manager is a risk but we need someone soon &amp; it does seem he has the support of most fans who've commented - so he'd start with a lot of goodwill. Better than loads saying they don't want who we appoint!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarah_WBAx @Baggiepat Yep - I'd have him in a heartbeat!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarah_WBAx @Baggiepat Basically you've just summed my views on leading  candidates perfectly - so I won't tweet it now! üëçüòÅ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CllrLeigh I think terminal panic has set in! He's eventually realised he wasn't originally elected because of who he was!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the few, not the many! How to misjudge the politcal mood "par excellence!" #changeuk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All Change then...! #changeuk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@histevegray @Cj01912 Yep - can't really believe how they are running this club! Seem to have no plan &amp; no idea what they want - except he has to cheap &amp; available!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cj01912 Picking fluff out of their belly buttons! What a shower! #faffing since March - we were on verge of signing Preston manager in April but no "plan B" when he didn't want it! Short list? No list seems nearer the point!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizJRudd Wonderful! A friend of mine went there in his hippie days &amp; fell in love it. He went back a couple of times!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizJRudd It's a small world now, Liz! What a wonderful experience for him though! You must be very proud?<|endoftext|>
