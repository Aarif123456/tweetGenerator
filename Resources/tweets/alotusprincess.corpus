<|startoftext|>@resistersiste20 How to be an anti-racist is about actively being anti-racist.

<|startoftext|>A man who truly loves and respects a woman, truly believes her to be his equal, would call himself a feminist.  He would stand by her side as she fought for her rights to equality.

<|startoftext|>@brai_shaq @justiceleagueuk I feel like if dressing that way has a strategic fighting advantage that the men should dress that way too. Or I don't buy it lol.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FranWongWrites @ibroome @PatrickRothfuss True. Good point, course Shrek was no Belle...But still an evolved tale.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doctor What?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ibroome @FranWongWrites @PatrickRothfuss Lol of course.  But we can certainly evolve the story now days. Or at least educate young 'uns to the pros and cons of the tale.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ibroome @FranWongWrites @PatrickRothfuss I've always wondered why he did not change while all those years under the curse.  A lot of time to think, to see what he did to others. Hmm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ibroome @FranWongWrites @PatrickRothfuss I have always 💜this tale. Some good messages. But ultimately for women it's a Bluebeard tale.  We must recognize that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sulwen @PatrickRothfuss True<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ibroome @FranWongWrites @PatrickRothfuss She basically had to choose between two narcissists. She just choose the least dangerous and the richest, what else could a woman do then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FranWongWrites @BenTenBlessing @PatrickRothfuss And all those innocent servants. In the original he is a full grown ruler if it helps.  The servants are still toast though.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sick of hearing from men who wrote their mom's name on the voting ballot. Don't you get it guys? Voting for Hillary WAS the vote for mom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT_Anders I hear ya.  Waiting on one myself.  So tense.  Hang in there :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@zebrasnake @vincentdonofrio True, my original comment did not use the words white privilege.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevenA92373684 @vincentdonofrio Where do you get your pithy wit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevenA92373684 @ansonmount @RoninsHammer Live long and prosper dude<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zebrasnake @vincentdonofrio K all I said was basically if you have a great safety net, it's easier to say wait and see, stay calm.  That's all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevenA92373684 @vincentdonofrio Oh my aren't you the charmer ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zebrasnake @vincentdonofrio Cool<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Dan_is_Tweeting @vincentdonofrio It's not my subtext.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dan_is_Tweeting @vincentdonofrio No<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ansonmount @RoninsHammer 😄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BHaddock1 @vincentdonofrio And?  (P.S. I voted for her. I'm a woman over 40.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@creekbear @vincentdonofrio I'm only talking about what is right now.  And I'm not attacking.  Just offering perspective.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vincentdonofrio PS Really looking forward to The Magnificent Seven :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshOlow @vincentdonofrio True.  It's not a sin either.  It just is and give that person the opportunity to do good if they choose too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jfreewright Amen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vincentdonofrio I'm not arguing that. I like you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@oh_dit @vincentdonofrio I'm not shaming anyone, I'm offering perspective.   It's scary at the bottom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oh_dit @vincentdonofrio Sure you can agree with anyone, anything you wish ✌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vincentdonofrio Here's the thing, and this is absolutely not a personal dig, but the safest spot to "wait and see" from is to be : White, Male, and well off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tsirachel Tell your brain chill out cuze it knows u r brilliant.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ansonmount @gypsiegirlz No not terrible.  Just average and a woman and far better than Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ansonmount @Nashvlkitn Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Warren, heck, if he runs against Trump, I'd vote for your dog.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you voted for anyone but Hillary, if you didn't vote at all, Trump is on you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The glass ceiling didn't even crack.<|endoftext|>
