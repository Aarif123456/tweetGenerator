<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump 'Everybody knows it was Rigged' .... except at least 80+ million people and the whole judicial system!!   The true hoax is #Trump perpetuating this false conspiracy to encourage his base to keep donating to his 'defense fund' aka his massive debts!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dr_rythm2003 @bison_stew @DPWIMM @realDonaldTrump The mail in votes were counted AFTER in person votes so, of course, as Biden encouraged people to use mail in ballots &amp; Trump discouraged it, the mail in ballots were mainly for Biden - &amp; I think you need to have a good, hard look in the mirror, Barry, before calling someone dumb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dr_rythm2003 @bison_stew @DPWIMM @realDonaldTrump Not quite sure what the point if this is .... neither the media nor Big Tech decide elections, and neither does #Trump although he tried to declare himself the winner on Election Night, didn't he??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dr_rythm2003 @bison_stew @DPWIMM @realDonaldTrump Bit rude there Barry; when you have to resort to name-calling you've pretty much lost the argument.  But, anyway, you are quite right, it is the people who vote on &amp; decide elections which is what has happened here - and #Trump lost!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dr_rythm2003 @bison_stew @DPWIMM @realDonaldTrump I think the time has come for some blunt speaking .... it is YOU, Barry, who doesn't 'get it'.   America has had an election - #TRUMP LOST!!  If there is 'massive voter fraud', why is he bothering to go &amp; campaign in Georgia for the Senate runoff races??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dr_rythm2003 @bison_stew @DPWIMM @realDonaldTrump Stick with the topic Barry, we're discussing the election, not New World Order.  If all these lawsuits are failing in the lower courts for lack of evidence, how is it you think it will be any different for SCOTUS?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rahra231214 @realDonaldTrump So, not only are you challenging your country's electoral process &amp; democracy, you are now casting doubt on the integrity of your country's judicial system. After four years of #Trump, THIS is Making America Great Again??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dr_rythm2003 @bison_stew @DPWIMM @realDonaldTrump How &amp; when will we see it? All the lawsuits have been dismissed for lack of evidence. What do you know that the rest of us don't?  You only know what the Trump legal team keep saying, that they have evidence. But when they get into court, there is no evidence &amp; it all falls apart<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BabblingBrook @DPWIMM @realDonaldTrump Legally, rumors, hearsay, opinions &amp; conjecture are NOT evidence in a court of law.  All these lawsuits keep failing when they get to court because they don't have the solid evidence to support them. You may strongly believe your 'fact', but where is the evidence to support it??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dr_rythm2003 @bison_stew @DPWIMM @realDonaldTrump Why do the courts keep flinging these lawsuits out then??  I'll keep saying it, rumors, opinions, hearsay, assumptions, conjecture do not represent EVIDENCE in a court of law.  These lawsuits require SOLID EVIDENCE to stand up in court, but they simply don't have it ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You're absolutely right @realDonaldTrump, the whole world is watching, and applauding that Joe Biden WON THE ELECTION!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Eric ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trochiaj @potsie @EJL0398 @KMCRadio @MattBraynard Then why are ALL these courts throwing these lawsuits out??  You are not only challenging your own country's electoral system, which is shocking enough in itself, you are now challenging your own country's judicial system. You should take a step back &amp; think hard about that ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EJL0398 @KMCRadio I may not agree with you politically, but I applaud your honesty in reading this situation ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KMCRadio @Robert79731901 No, it's what you're choosing to see and extrapolate .... to the rest of us (&amp; the world) the courts have been very clear, there needs to be solid evidence for these lawsuits to move forward &amp; there just isn't ... &amp; it's the media that have highlighted 'typos' etc, not the courts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robert79731901 @JoeBiden So what??  Frankly, President Mickey Mouse would be a better option than President #Trump ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamEvansStevens @realDonaldTrump You are so right, Samantha, what's happening is very scary for America and the rest of the world. Hitler pushed Germany into a world war &amp; #Trump is pushing America into a civil war. Faster transitions &amp; curtailing of presidential powers during transition should be initiated ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReedHeustis @SaltyDo20134950 @realDonaldTrump Legally, when an accusation is made, the burden of proof is always on the accuser.  The reason all these lawsuits keep failing is lack of PALPABLE evidence .... rumor, hearsay, opinion &amp; conjecture are not evidence in a court of law.    #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LesScott77 @ElephantWeIgnor @newsmax @JennaEllisEsq @stinchfield1776 Try and think it through ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nyx452 @Dt33345 @TalbertSwan @realDonaldTrump Then why are so many of the lawsuits failing in the courts??  Because, despite all the noise about having evidence of massive fraud, when they actually do get inside a court room, it turns out they don't!!  Rumors, opinions, conjecture &amp; assumptions are not evidence, I'm afraid!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nyx452 @TalbertSwan @realDonaldTrump You're wrong, Biden has to prove nothing.  It is up to #Trump to prove if there was voter fraud or malfeasance; this is already being tested in the courts and coming up short on evidence as proof.

They need to read the fine print ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Esther24901878 5 x 72 million is 360 million, most of which will go to paying off #Trump's massive campaign debt - there will be no ROI, just money down the drain!!  It's why #Trump is not conceding, he needs to keep the money from his base flowing in ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Esther24901878 Yes, 73 million people voted for #Trump, but nearly 80 million voted for #Biden - 6+ million more.  All in all, it was a terrific turnout for both candidates, but, ultimately, Biden won because he got more votes and that is how elections work ....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Farbeka It's going to be a very rough two months ahead, but after the inauguration, it will calm down.  Hopefully, the US can get there without #Trump causing a civil war and/or international incident, because once the realisation sets in, his leaving legacy will be #ScorchedEarth ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidFurnessGB As we say in the UK (and as a non-American you should know) that is a case of pot calling the kettle black .... Trump supporters and Brexiteers have a lot of things in common, stupidity being a major one!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LolaHumphrey19 @the_resistor @realDonaldTrump It certainly isn't a 'victory' for the American people.  If he has nothing to hide, then why not just release them?

<|startoftext|>@AgNTEX @CATnOATS @Jillie_Alexis Those things were already happening when #Trump got elected in 2016.

<|startoftext|>I've been trying to explain this (badly) all day, but you've just put it beautifully @stylewylde .... this is exactly what happened!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Digital_Black @CNN please, please can you cover this and show the video?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdorrDeplorr Well, #PresidentPlump clearly didn't know .... and that's all that matters .... üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdorrDeplorr Well, they kept silent on this wonderful prank until it beautifully unfolded .... anyway, it doesn't really matter because despite the prank, only 6,611 people showed up for this rally which is pretty bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump Ohh dear .... üòÜ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdorrDeplorr Whatever you think of them, they are the true 'silent majority', and they're going to be around a lot longer than the silent majority #PresidentPlump is relying on .... go America's youth!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think we all just found out who the 'silent majority' really are - #tiktokteens .... pssst, someone better let #PresidentPlump know!!  #TrumpMeltdown  #TrumpRallyFail  #Trump #SilentMajority<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So #tiktokteens reserved 1,000s of tickets to #TrumpTulsaRally prompting the Trump campaign to brag it had 1 million ticket requests &amp; put up another stage to deal with the overflow - a BRILLIANT prank!! BUT, in reality, only 6,611 maga people showed up anyway - a stunning fail!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdorrDeplorr Not just 'liberals', teenagers .... the youth and future of America.  Also, what happens and how well attended Biden's rallies will be remains to be seen.  Your hubristic prediction implies you have evidence or prior knowledge - but we both know that's not true ....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Does anyone else notice that whenever #PresidentPlump gets caught out on a tweet, like the #RacistBaby one which he shamefully manipulated, he madly tweets and retweets other stuff to make it drop down his feed?

<|startoftext|>@Bigjimkohler0 @lindyli @joncoopertweets Yes, I totally agree with you, the timing of this book release is very damaging for #Trump.  Plus he needs to be overwhelmingly voted out by the American people, not just removed (which was never going to happen anyway with the Senate) .... you're absolutely right @Bigjimkohler0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lindyli The Senate were NEVER going to vote to remove #Trump regardless of what evidence was put in front of them.  But Bolton releasing his book just months before the election is far more damaging for #Trump, especially with the ongoing virus &amp; BLM issues etc.  It's a shrewd move ....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LON3WOLFF Hmm, not sure where you got this from, but it contains a pretty bad grammatical error that rather throws shade on its authenticity.

<|startoftext|>@johncardillo So, instead of aiming for his legs to bring him down (still not right, but at least he would still be alive), they cold-bloodedly shot him in the back three times .... no ifs or buts, they MURDERED him!! #RayshardBrooks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He was patted down &amp; found to be unarmed &amp; then shot in the back three times!!  IF they had to shoot him, why not aim for his legs?  Shooting him in the back THREE TIMES was unnecessary and MURDER!! .... and all for being asleep in his car!!  #RayshardBrooks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>THISüëáis what the rest of the world is seeing happening in America .... why the rioting??  Well, when #Trump says ‚Äòwhat do you have to lose?‚Äô, these people have nothing to lose, because that‚Äôs exactly what they have - NOTHING!!  Welcome to #TrumpAmerica .... #TrumpResignNow  https://t.co/xksCLaqvbY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is very disturbing about this image is the way the white police officer has his hand in his pocket while he's kneeling on the neck of a HANDCUFFED black man who subsequently died - hand in pocket &amp; smirking while committing murder!! This is what #Trump has created .....  https://t.co/K7qLplHcpz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty much sums up what's happening in America right now. This is only going to get worse .... those lovely people, the white supremicists, will probably turn up next &amp; then there will be a full-blown civil war!!

<|startoftext|>@LaraLeaTrump @realDonaldTrump This could all have been avoided .... a policeman kneeling on the neck of a handcuffed man until he dies is MURDER!!  The policeman has not been arrested, but a CNN crew got arrested.  #PresidentPlump needs to DO HIS JOB &amp; calm things down, instead of inciting violence!! #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JLinMiller @real_defender @realDonaldTrump .... and that's why a proper President has QUALIFIED and EXPERIENCED diplomats who know when they are being lied to - as opposed to schoolboy Kushner et al who clearly got played!!  #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Don't think #PresidentPlump knows about #cnnarrested yet (or doesn't care; it WAS CNN after all, not Fox News .... because, for some strange reason, he's tweeting about something completely different!!  #Trump #Minneapolisprotests  #MinneapolisRiot  #RacistPresident<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump ERRR, HELLO?? .... are you deliberately ignoring what's happened overnight in Minnesota??  You talk about making America great again .... you're absolutely not, you're slowly KILLING America!! #Minneapolisprotests  #OmarJiminez<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkHarlen @Cubazuela_com @YozTheElder @real_defender @realDonaldTrump They sure are .... I'm in the UK and it seems like #Trump is completely out of his depth and slowly self-destructing in both the most shocking &amp; laughable ways.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is soooo weird!!  The rest of the world is watching this shocking event happen live while America is still asleep .... I'm in the UK &amp; woke up my friend in Kansas - so, so shocking!!  What on earth is happening to America??  https://t.co/5ZQ1fvVp1B<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PalmerReport Yes!!  In the UK, we watched #OmarJimenez get arrested live on #CNN - totally shocking!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JAYAFC5 Ohh I see, you were with him then? Otherwise, how do you know?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JAYAFC5 And the trip to Barnard Castle (on his wife's birthday) purportedly to 'test' his eyesight??

<|startoftext|>@th16ghmn @RedGrouper @DouglasCarswell Just you then ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JAYAFC5 No, he didn't, and we'll see ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JAYAFC5 No, I‚Äôm refusing to engage with anything this gov says or does until they do the right thing &amp; bin #DominicCummings .... when that happens, confidence &amp; trust will be restored &amp; we can move on, and YOU can namecall all you like, but until then they can stuff their #TrackAndTrace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@th16ghmn @RedGrouper @DouglasCarswell Nope, you‚Äôre wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@th16ghmn @RedGrouper @DouglasCarswell No, it absolutely isn't .... the media are DOING THEIR JOB because the government appear unable to police and regulate themselves ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmenzies_ Perfectly put James .... thank you!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope, not interested .... when the government protects the likes of #DominicCummings, then all confidence &amp; trust is gone and, consequently, I have zero interest in 'trace &amp; contact' or anything else this shitshow gov has to say ........ you're pathetic!!  https://t.co/5rLRU7TzpX<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@waynelico Don't forget to strap your child in the back ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABridgen The only surprise I'm experiencing is why #DominicCummings (supposed genius) thought going for a safety test drive WITH his son in the car was a good idea, &amp; why he thought the British public would fall for such a lame excuse?  Clearly, he must arrogantly think we're all stupid!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyDannyEsq @BorisJohnson would need a pair of bollocks for that .... which he clearly hasn‚Äôt got!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Integrity: the quality of being honest &amp; having strong moral principles .... you need to RESIGN #DominicCummings #CumGate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BBCBreakfast Screeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaammmming!!!!!!  Hate, hate, hate @BorisJohnson and this shitshow gov for this ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't give a flying fxxk what @BorisJohnson has got to say since he put the interests of the odious #DominicCummings above those of the 60 million people of the UK (including many thousands of SINGLE PARENTS) - all confidence, trust &amp; credibility in this elitist gov has gone ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#dailybriefing turned off as soon as @BorisJohnson, so predictably, gave his backing to the arrogant &amp; nasty #DominicCummings, with all confidence &amp; trust in this lying, two-faced, hypocritical government gone forever ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@francisobrienUK Comparing vulnerable Caroline Flack to hardman Cummings is completely laughable!!  Typical arrogant Tory 'do as I say, not as I do' attitudes flying around interwoven with multiple lies .... the press are just DOING THEIR JOB in exposing the whole sorry episode!! #DominicCummings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@francisobrienUK Because they knew he was going to blatantly try to lie his way out of it ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Be better without the likes of #DominicCummings and his 'do as I say, not as I do' attitude .... arrogant arsehole!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Carla_littlerob @jk_rowling @piersmorgan Yes, because Cummings is such a kind person himself - not .... this is the man behind the herd immunity policy, who was quite happy with the needless deaths of thousands of pensioners .... he is a nasty, individual who thinks the rules don't apply to him ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DominicCummings should be sacked!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Shut up #PresidentPlump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scottytissue73 Trump doesn't write books - he can barely read. Your 'leader' is under attack &amp; the whole purpose of a cult is to idolize &amp; protect their leader. Trump does what he does to appease &amp; trigger his base, then you all jump to his defence which makes him feel secure again - bit sad!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely brilliant!! #PresidentPlump  #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxBusiness Ohh good, that makes two of you then .... because no-one else 'understands' or even knows what the heck you're blathering on about - as usual!!  #PresidentPlump  #Trump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Similar to #PresidentPlump, Margaret Thatcher (The Iron Lady) enjoyed the wholehearted support of her party, until one day it was felt she had gone too far and that support, especially of her closest allies &amp; confidantes, just melted away leading to her very quick demise .... @VP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Toniann561 @JakeSherman @VP Where @VP?  Well, my guess is he's either contracted the virus (possible).... or is pretending to have contracted the virus so he can bone up on the 25thAmendment (hopefully more likely) #PresidentPlump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TimRunsHisMouth Is she taking #Hydroxycloroquine too??  Ohh wow!!  #Trump #morbidlyobese<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hale_razor @scottytissue73 No, it's just behaviour breeds behaviour .... when #Trump displays very offensive behaviour, he should expect that behaviour in return .... instead, he goes into victim-mode .... but then he is a bully, and all bullies are cowards in reality ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scottytissue73 Ohh dear, you are one angry person who twists everything to suit yr narrative.  No, I do not want anybody 'gone', #Trump is a dangerous, &amp; increasingly desperate, person who has created a cult-like following willing to emulate everything he does, no matter how shocking or harmful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scottytissue73 No, I don't hate his supporters, I feel sorry for them ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConservUSA38 @SpeakerPelosi No, it's about #Trump being #morbidlyobese &amp; allegedly taking an unproven drug .... a shocking example to vulnerable people who may follow &amp; copy what he does ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@requiemforameme .... it's a fact, so your point is?? #morbidlyobese  #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FragrantTuna Childish, immature &amp; unnecessary is everything that comes out of Trump's mouth .... #morbidlyobese in relation to his size is just a fact ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar Fox News trying to swerve a lawsuit there ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConservUSA38 @SpeakerPelosi #Trump is #morbidlyobese ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scottytissue73 Yes and no .... Some people do hate #Trump .... but those same people are not concerned about his health &amp; wellbeing (I don't think they could care less); they are very concerned tho about the health &amp; wellbeing of vulnerable people who may choose to copy him .... #morbidlyobese<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LottaGelato Firstly, behaviour breeds behaviour, if you don't like people 'slinging mud' at you, then don't do it yourself. Secondly, #Trump is #morbidlyobese period. Lastly, yes, he keeps coming back but not stronger, just more desperate &amp; outrageous bc he knows November is fast approaching<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump is saying he is taking #Hydroxychloroquine to divert attention away from the DOJ's negative response to Trump's #ObamaGate .... same Trumpshit, different day .... I can feel a major tweetstorm brewing!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TakeTrumpOut @look4goodinppl @drdave1999 Thank you ... yes, if there's one good thing to come out of all this it's that the #NHS is now untouchable. The British people love the NHS but, after #Brexit, Boris was looking to sell it off to Trump &amp; American big pharma - he won't dare now .... good luck to you too in Nov üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TakeTrumpOut @look4goodinppl @drdave1999 Well, apparently, we've got Boris back at helm tomorrow .... be interesting to see how his brush with Covid has changed him.

<|startoftext|>@ScottAdamsSays Hmmm .... don't remember the word 'trachea' but I definitely remember the word 'INJECT' .... but hey, the world needs a good laugh atm and, trust me, they're howling with laughter over this one!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TakeTrumpOut @drdave1999 I'm in the UK .... the most frightening aspect about #Trump is that, after all the horrific things that he's said &amp; done in the last 3.5 years, there are still so many Americans who are willing to vote for him again .... why??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeplorableNew @ThaTrigga @GodBlessUSA316 @Acosta Nope, not a Biden supporter, not even American ..... just enjoy global politics as a hobby as I have done for many years.  #Trump winning in 2016 was no surprise, the rustbelt states were hurting &amp; he tapped into that .... but that was then &amp; this is now - a very different world<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeplorableNew @ThaTrigga @GodBlessUSA316 @Acosta Ys, it's sad, isn't it?  He wouldn't be my choice (step up Governor Cuomo), but then anyone would be better than #Trump .... üòâ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DeplorableNew @ThaTrigga @GodBlessUSA316 @Acosta Ok, one topic at a time, no point in discussing Biden bec he isn't officially the Dem atm (nice tactic trying to change the subject tho) .... and, frankly, anyone and I really mean ANYONE including Mickey Mouse would be a better #POTUS than Spanky!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Shadow_Angelx @MikeSatani @girlsreallyrule @PaulaReidCBS He didn't answer her questions because he couldn't, it's as simple as that ....

<|startoftext|>@AndeyTheRxn @JaimeJo1982 It was a reasonable &amp; very appropriate question.

<|startoftext|>@nendaas1 That was a poll of a paltry 512 people .... also, #Trump has clearly failed in his handling of the #CoronaCrisis and that cannot be ignored ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOW!! .... I'm switching between the two press conferences going on in the US and here in the UK, and both #Trump &amp; #BorisJohnson are seriously losing their rags!!

<|startoftext|>Hey @ChrisCuomo, we can hear from Mum in the UK!! LOL!! @cnn #ImpeachmentHearing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gunnermichaels @RepBarragan Grow up @gunnermichaels!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ManOfManners No she isn't .... you are presuming, and presuming got Grdon Sondland into trouble<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rly_y No, she said their families came from the same area of England ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuzanneWolf She's from the northeast of England .... and they take no prisoners!! #ImpeachmentHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrioticVoices Are you watching the #ImpeachmentHearings now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrioticVoices Ok, that is your view and I respect it, but see the situation very differently ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrioticVoices So you think Trump is innocent of all allegations and will not be impeached and removed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrioticVoices What lies?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cspan How childish .... no wonder he works for Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beckybuck I'm talking about people of any political persuasion prepared to put country over party, who really do want to see America's image become great again and not mired in Trump's dirty dealings .... these televised #ImpeachmentHearings are very revealing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RepMikeTurner .... talk to Rudy!! #TalkToRudy #ImpeachmentHearing  #ImpeachmentInquiry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This hashtag #TalkToRudy soooo needs to go viral and trend!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It absolutely is .... because it explains everything that happened!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump "Talk to Rudy ...."  #ImpeachmentHearing #ImpeachmentInquiry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Perhaps no-one has told you this, Spanky, but the #ImpeachmentHearings are being televised, so we all watched what happened .... and the media reported it spot on!! The Republicans had a terrible day &amp; you trying to gaslight everyone into believing otherwise is just plain silly!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bennyjohnson @Jim_Jordan Hmmmm, don't think so ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, where does the #ImpeachmentHearing go from here? If Trump says there was no quid pro quo order from him (which we all really know is not true), then what was Guilinani up to??  Trump told everyone to "talk to Rudy".  Is it not time for Guiliani to come and explain?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beckybuck Of course there was!!  üòÇüòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CliveWismayer From one grammar geek to another @CliveWismayer .... thank you!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LetsTryThis111 @cnnbrk "Talk to Rudy ...."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It would seem that the testimony of Gordon Sondland could be summed up in three little words "Talk to Rudy".  Weirdly, they appear to both clear, and then implicate #Trump at the same time ....  #ImpeachmentHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump 'TALK TO RUDY' .... nudge nudge, wink wink #ImpeachmentHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@themaxburns I want nothing, I want nothing .... talk to Rudy ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realkevinvb He wasn't exactly going to say 'I want Ukraine to spill dirt on the Bidens before they get their aid' .... what he did say was 'talk to Rudy' .... nudge nudge, wink wink<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realkevinvb It's very clear .... but he's lying!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FutbolFan5 Miss Screamy!! #AngerManagement<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Nice one Jackie Speier!!  #ImpeachmentHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yourvokalnews Love Bernie!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally!!  Adam Schiff is saying what needs to be said .... yes, yes, yes!!  #ImpeachmentHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clearly, Trump was doing everything through back channels (headed by Rudy Guiliani) so nothing could directly stick to him .... like a mob boss, he gives the kill order but someone else pulls the trigger - Republicans getting desperate .... #ImpeachmentHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yashjoshi420 I think we all did .... LOL!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coyote8787 @HashtagHijinx I do pity your poor Mum üòÜ .... like I said, time will tell ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has anyone actually asked Pizza Express in Woking about #PrinceAndrew visiting their restaurant when he said? I'm absolutely certain that ANY restaurant who receives a visit from a member of the RF would never forget that - Pizza Express HQ must know .... #PrinceAndew<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Claire_Phipps Hey FBI!!  Get on a flight and get over here, Prince Nonce is ready to talk ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brilliant!! ü§£ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coyote8787 @HashtagHijinx No, she's not the one who's been brainwashed ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good!! .... does that mean we (the taxpayers) don't have to put up with and PAY for yet another Royal wedding next year??  #PompousTwat #RoyalFamilyShame   https://t.co/BTfVdnWLAq  https://t.co/KA9iKrfczM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Which Republican is that??  Any particular Republican??  Ohhhh wait, you mean Republicans plural!! üòÇüòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coyote8787 @HashtagHijinx Well, There We Are Then, I guess only time will tell ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_Sommerfeldt Because the desperation of this guy's questioning is funny!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heatheroverhere Tempus narrabo üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarolinaOpinion Well, duhhh, of course Trump was never going to OPENLY admit there were pre-conditions attached to the Ukraine military aid - as per his usual modus operandi, he acted thru murky back channels (Guiliani), like a mob boss who gives the kill order but someone else pulls the trigger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heatheroverhere What planet are you watching this on??  Trump's finished ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who is this guy Nunes and what's he talking about?? #ImpeachmentHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BobSellersSings @realDonaldTrump Nah, that's never going to wash ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nyladawg The whole world is smiling .... I'm in London üòÅ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow .... I reckon we're going to see some serious fireworks when it gets to Jim Jordan's turn to cross-examine - Gordon Sondland doesn't look or sound as if he could be easily intimidated &amp; good for him!! #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love your analogy ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coyote8787 @HashtagHijinx No, it's because the GOP have completely lost their moral compass &amp; refuse to remove Trump no matter what he does .... but the 2020 election will be a different ballgame, and for him to be voted out of office bythe American people is a much better option than impeachment anyway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SapAud @jeremycorbyn So, because Labour are the only party offering that second chance to make an INFORMED decision .... that‚Äôs who I‚Äôll be voting for .... Johnson will sell off the NHS first chance he gets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SapAud @jeremycorbyn Nope, no sarcasm .... he is, quite rightly, giving the country a second chance to make an INFORMED decision on #Brexit that he will support whichever way it goes. I don‚Äôt care what he thinks, it‚Äôs irrelevant, I just want the opportunity to make an INFORMED vote in a second ref<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@halford_rosie Yes, totally agree ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrIanHitchings @GMB @susannareid100 .... and Boris is??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HashtagHijinx Sadly, won't happen because the Senate will never remove even if he is impeached ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#HistoryWillRememberTrump as a one term president ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jungli999 So talking about piccaninnies with watermelon smiles and referring to Muslim women as letterboxes and bank robbers isn't racist??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jungli999 Johnson is a known liar and racist ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattrainey3 Why is he clueless??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SapAud Why should @jeremycorbyn 'reveal his position' on #Brexit, it's up to the people to make an INFORMED decision and that's what he's offering ..... Johnson just lies about everything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Roysl Family is beyond reproach!!!!  I don't bloody think so .... #ITVdebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@searchprop1 What the hell happened toJohnson's weight??  He's ballooned!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jungli999 No, you just WANT to know .... he's no liar like Johnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnoymousN Go watch the BBC then,they are SHOCKINGLY biased towards the Tories ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OutramBradley Ohh god, I hope so!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aaronaddidle You're not listening then ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShappiKhorsandi No, he answered fully and eloquently .... Julie Etchingham needs to ask Johnson about his MANY racist comments, i.e piccaninnies with watermelon smiles, letterboxes, bank robbers etc etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ANTISEMITISM??  Really?? .... you're going to bring that up??  Then ask @BorisJohnson about piccaninnies, watermelon #miles, letterboxes and bank robbers .... #ITVdebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattGaller98 How does caring about the NHS, the homeless and the shocking housing crisis, our schools, and how some people are struggling with their lives due to austerity mean that @jeremycorbyn should be unelectable??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@colinwatkins Clearly, you've never lived in a country where only private medical insurance is available and, clearly, you have no idea how expensive US drugs are ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stphencornelius Really?? .... perception definitely is everything, seems like Johnson is attracting the derision<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ian_ov_preston @jeremycorbyn Because it was won on a bed of lies and misinformation ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scoobie53wrx Wherever we buy them now, the US will insist on a monopoly of our drugs market in exchange for a good trade deal after #Brexit ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigdaddystauf Doubtful .... and why wait??  What exactly are you waiting for??  If there is evidence to go after the Bidens, then WHY is it not being investigated??  You act as if something is stopping you - what??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rockmomnoff @realDonaldTrump Yep, watching in London ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eringofa @Jim_Jordan Sitting here in London glued to the #ImpeachmentHearings and my husband just expressed the same sentiment .... if the #MuellerReport found 'nothing', why are so many of Trump's 'associates' in (or are going to) jail??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigdaddystauf So why isn't it being taken further??  The Republicans control the Senate and, until the midterms, they controlled the House too ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Epw51119261 @David31451 Doubtful ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus, how desperate (and angry) are the Republicans with the stupid, petty, irrelevant questions being asked .... Trump has been caught bang-to-rights trying to STRONGARM UKRAINE INTO DIGGING UP DIRT ON JOE BIDEN - seriously, it's not rocket science!!  #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigdaddystauf Just a 'coincidence' that he was asking for an investigation on Joe Biden then .... his politicsl opponent??  Also, however much you (&amp; Trump) want it to be, there is no evidence against the Bidens ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Politweet8 Desperation ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Epw51119261 @David31451 Your support of Trump is admirable .... but your assertion of how history will remember him is very misjudged.  A second term is looking increasingly unlikely as he will probably resign for 'health' reasons rather than face losing the election ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Itsanewday99 @jpuopolo He has a heart??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@msenicaracing @realDonaldTrump Why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It's 'receive' .... 'i' before 'e' except after 'c' .... unbelievable that this is the President of the United States!!  #PresidentMoron<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChicoMagee It will never happen .... #PrinceAndrewbbc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ggreenwald But, you know what, absolutely nothing will happen to him, he will never face prosecution or even just police questioning .... and he knows that.  He's only worried about his reputation &amp; how he can make this all go away ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is the point of this??  Nothing, I repeat, absolutely NOTHING is going to happen to this horrible individual because the Establishment will not let it happen, and all because this pompous twat is the Queen's son .... disgusting!! #UKshame   https://t.co/uljq0Rl59V<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@garek80 Ohh definitely!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PrinceAndrew is guilty as sin but, unfortunately, there is a very strong &amp; powerful Establishment in the UK who, along with the subservient, cap-doffing portion of the British proletariat, will protect him &amp; the Monarchy at all costs .... bit sad, but that's how it is in the UK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IBackBritain @BBCPolitics Pathetic .... and desperate!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joeinthejeep No worries, I get it ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joeinthejeep As for #Trump getting elected again, he only won last time because of the widespread hatred of HRC, a lot of Dems either didn't vote or held their noses &amp; voted for Trump to avoid getting her - it will be very different this time after 4 years ofTrump &amp; his antics, &amp; no HRC ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joeinthejeep A prettily written piece that waffles on but says nothing of substance .... the fact is #Trump tried to bribe/coerce a foreign country to produce dirt on his political opponent - it's illegal, against the American Constitution &amp; definitely not going to Make America Great Again!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LillysMom22 @RepMarkMeadows @realDonaldTrump I'm actually in the UK &amp; watch many news channels that all seem to think no evidence has emerged that implicates the Bidens .... perhaps you should try watching news channels other than the very Trump-biased Fox News?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MRPIE314 @PressSec This is the start of his 'getout' .... #Trump will not be removed through impeachment or go for a second term .... he will resign for health reasons AFTER he's struck a deal to protect him &amp; his family from prosecution after he leaves office<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump No, they didn't ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USA_EaglesUp Read it, load of rubbish by a rightwing journalist .... Trump is not fit to be POTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USA_EaglesUp What lies??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LillysMom22 @RepMarkMeadows @realDonaldTrump If the Republicans control the Senate, then why have the Bidens not been investigated??  Before the midterm elections, they held both the House and the Senate, why did nothing come out then??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#IHopeOurNextPresident doesn't use Twitter .... üôè<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LillysMom22 @RepMarkMeadows @realDonaldTrump Stop trying to make it about the Bidens, if there was evidence of wrongdoing by them, it would have been investigated properly. But there wasn't, so #Trump decided to go a different route &amp; coerce a foreign country into discrediting a political opponent for him - that's the crime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LillysMom22 @RepMarkMeadows @realDonaldTrump So he didn't ask President Zelensky for a 'favour'?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@5haronl @jeremycorbyn Except, the referendum was based on misinformation and lies ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tishplusted @UKLabour @Team4Nature Hope you're healthy then Tina with no 'pre-existing conditions, because the NHS in its present form will disappear under Johnson when he gifts it to America .... private healthcare insurance is an absolute nightmare!! #GE2019 #SaveOurNHS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Should .... such an important little word and you used it twice!!  Sadly (for you), all this is really happening &amp; you simply cannot &amp; will not make it go away just because you think it 'should' ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmm .... rumour has it that a peerage for Farage was the bargaining chip for this latest strategy .... are the nasty, conniving Conservatives willing to confirm/deny this?? #GE2019   https://t.co/u4xBk2jJLj  https://t.co/6snrxQDTe5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hi @mrjamesob at @LBC, If possible, can you cover this story tomorrow as one of your topics please? Many thanks!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, yes, yes!! .... thank you @donwinslow for saying what I've always said &amp; believed for years .... large-scale money-laundering is the core of everything @realDonaldTrump has done &amp; what he's desperately trying to hide; that is why he's a criminal &amp; needs to go to prison ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No idea why the Republicans are getting their knickers in a twist over the name of the #Whistleblower .... who he is DOESN'T MATTER .... the testimony from the impeachment hearings is proving very damaging for #Trump &amp; that fact alone should be the priority!! #QuidProQuo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MJiricka @AlanaKStewart Why??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnieHe62939267 @AndyOstroy @realDonaldTrump It's 'they're', not 'their' .... sigh!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@real_defender @realDonaldTrump Not many ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A nice but somewhat confusing sentiment .... are you referring to the victims' friends &amp; family, or just the victims and your own friends &amp; family, or what??

<|startoftext|>@Bliadhnaichean @Otto_English Not just newspapers .... specifically The Sun (an adult comic for the literary-challenged) and The Telegraph (for the flagwavers)!,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Loic55093731 @WCullmac .... to be replaced by who?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenOld @WCullmac Your comments about @jeremycorbyn are pretty negative.  He has stopped #Brexit from happening so far &amp; has rightly committed to a 2nd ref for the people to make an INFORMED decision .... I passionately want to remain but we, the people, must make the final decision #GE2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WCullmac @elizabethf100 No, Winnie, that is wrong .... @jeremycorbyn is doing the right thing by putting the whole #Brexit issue back to the people to make an INFORMED decision - it is NOT about what he or Johnson or Swinson or Farage think, it's what WE think that matters .... stay strong!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clearly the 'antisemetic' &amp; 'terrorist' smears against ‚Å¶@jeremycorbyn‚Å© are getting a bit stale &amp; it's time for a new one!!  #GE2019   https://t.co/VMgA9spdQZ  https://t.co/hhhFv6VRXx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I now finally get what #MAGA really means .... Make America Germany All-over-again .... the similarities of what is happening by stealth in the US to pre-WW2 Germany plus the similarities of both would-be dictators are both stunning and scary!!  #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aren't you supposed to be languishing in a ditch somewhere?? #Brexit #GE2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This so needs to be seen and retweeted as much as possible!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hdot42 @LEBassett @AndyRichter Trump's base are like the the kids in the playground who suck up to the school bully .... until someone stands up to him; then he crumbles because, like all bullies, he's basically a coward .... and they scatter!! #Trump #BeBest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wishful thinking maybe, but I have a funny feeling that Spanky's tax returns are going to show his empire is really a fragile house of cards full of dodgy deals &amp; money laundering, &amp; that his boasts of being a wealthy &amp; successful. businessman are shallow .... let's hope!! #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @joswinson @LibDems I've never trusted the @LibDems after selling themselves to the Tories &amp; lying about uni fees.  @ITV have got it absolutely right .... a live debate with all seven leaders, &amp; then another one with just Johnson &amp; Corbyn - THAT will be interesting &amp; needs to happen!! #GC2019<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lcm031962 @KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump Trump is testing the waters with these sporting events because he knows he has to do more next year than just appear at his rallies for his rabid base .... shame he keeps getting booed!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grizzilypaw @TrumpInTheNews Loud boos with some cheers, or loud cheers with some boos - it's all in the personal perspective &amp; people will 'hear' what they want to hear.

<|startoftext|>@Novaskye34 @jones7955 @Lunateq .... or feelings!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jones7955 He has feelings??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Orpheus79 @biscuitafc I don't agree or disagree with the booing, it is what it is ..... a classic example of 'behaviour breeds behaviour', and Trump has brought this upon himself with his behaviour .... expect to see a lot more of it and worse as he fights to avoid becoming a one term president ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarolineLucas Yep, #Brexit will take us out of the frying pan into the fire ....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CarlWebbJR @GodDanC @TeachESL @Franklin_Graham You said, 'he wanted help with the Bar investigation' .... why did he want help?  Does he use his valuable time to weigh in on every investigation?  Or just the ones that could affect him personally by bringing down his political opponent?  ü§î<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thewiselady22 @SpeakerPelosi I think @SpeakerPelosi is amazing!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarlWebbJR @GodDanC @TeachESL @Franklin_Graham I think the upcoming impeachment hearings, which hopefully will be televised, will provide the proof you seek ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarlWebbJR @GodDanC @TeachESL @Franklin_Graham .... and froze their military funding at the same time!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarlWebbJR @GodDanC @TeachESL @Franklin_Graham It's not about Obama .... stay in point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@systemlord2000 @jeremycorbyn Lame joke ....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SonicSenna @jeremycorbyn Ohhh .... nothing to do with the severe under-funding of the NHS by the Tories then??  Still, that will all go away once we #Brexit &amp; the Americans get their hands on our NHS .... yaaaaaaay!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear America,  Please control your child, he's been very naughty poking his orange nose into our upcoming General Election.  It's bad enough with all the #Brexit bollocks going on, we absolutely don't need such blatant &amp; UNWANTED interference!!  Kind regards,  The UK  #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelDaudel How do you work that out??  Trump asked a foreign country to give him dirt in a political opponent .... that is forbidden by the Constitution.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MattHancock Just another Tory lie .... #SaveOurNHS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spot on!!  If we carry on voting in Tory govs, the #NHS as we know it will be gone in a few years, particularly with American private health companies waiting in the wings to swoop in &amp; take over after #Brexit. Good health is everything in life, don't let it happen!! #SaveOurNHS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #NHS should be a major centre issue of #GE2019.  If you are healthy, you can achieve just about anything, but the under-funding of the NHS is a deliberate stealth move by the Cons to promote private insurance, don't let them destroy our access to good health care #SaveOurNHS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sugermynot @DancingTheMind In the past 30 years, I've lived in three different countries with private health care systems .... it is expensive, limited, and very, very stressful.  The first question when you go to hospital is not 'how can we help you', it's 'how are you going to pay' .... #SaveOurNHS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sugermynot @DancingTheMind Plus premiums are much higher for smokers, the obese and people with pre-existing conditions .... you have an accident, the NHS will treat you with NO questions, PI ask a lot of questions before treatment &amp; can leave you with a nasty bill .... the NHS is a jewel but under-funded<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sugermynot @sokctnMIKIzYAu @DancingTheMind .... and that's EXACTLY what the Tories want, people like you deciding that private insurance is better than the NHS .... just remember though PI is very selective and won't pay for pre-existing conditions .... the NHS treats all conditions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sugermynot @DancingTheMind No, Darren .... the NHS is in its knees because of a massive and deliberate lack of funding.

<|startoftext|>@LesTroisChenes Watch the price of apples rocket .... and so it starts!! #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mooz_1 However, second point is that 2016 is now 3.5 years ago and the substance &amp; curcumstances have definitely changed since then, plus a lot of people have died, and a lot of young people are now of voting age .... so we do need a second referendum ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mooz_1 Two points .... first, the proposed vote today was blocked because the substance &amp; circumstances of the first vote have not changed since Saturday and, you're right, you can't keep having votes until you get the vote you want ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_ShaVerZ_ @HoC_Speaker_MP @LBC He‚Äôs actually got a massive following .... plus, if a second referendum was allowed, I think you‚Äôll find there is a far larger appetite to remain than leave now ....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Turnberry1906 @stolmeier @HwdBnd @emmawillmer @getagripquick @jessbrammar @realDonaldTrump @RaddSeiger It most certainly wasn't 'an unfortunate incident', it was a deliberate attempt to ambush the parents of #HarryDunn into an unexpected meeting with the woman who killed their son to bring a teary closure to the issue &amp; create an unbelievably 'sick' photo opportunity for Trump!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An incredible &amp; wonderfully articulate response from this lady that completely destroys the argument for 'respecting' the 2016 lie-ridden ref .... I hope people listen and it gets retweeted over and over!! #Brexit #PeoplesVoteMarch #PeoplesVote #PeoplesVoteNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LondonTimes Firstly, it's not up to the EU to decide how this plays out.  Secondly, so much has happened since the 2016 lie-ridden ref that the whole #Brexit issue should now go back to the people for their final say.  We have regular GEs, so after 3.5 years it's time for a 2nd #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People might think they're sick of #Brexit, but if we leave it will continue to drag on &amp; cause problems for years. If we choose to remain after a 2nd ref the whole thing goes away completely &amp; becomes a distant memory - after the racist leavers have stopped screaming of course!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patcondell Haha .... the Gov really shouldn't have been so smug in saying yes, the PM will send the extension request if the vote falls, but also yes, we're still definitely leaving on 31st October .... they got rumbled!!  Good for Letwin for his amendment .... love it!! #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stolmeier @HwdBnd @emmawillmer @getagripquick @Turnberry1906 @jessbrammar @realDonaldTrump @RaddSeiger Then you would have played right into her &amp; Trump's hands. He was trying to bring closure without Sacoolas having to return to the UK to face justice. Good for them that they had the strength &amp; sense to decline. They may never get justice but she will never find peace either ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stolmeier @HwdBnd @emmawillmer @getagripquick @Turnberry1906 @jessbrammar @realDonaldTrump @RaddSeiger Any meeting should be on their terms, not hers .... and definitely not Trump's, he tried to ambush them - disgusting behaviour!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HwdBnd @emmawillmer @getagripquick @Turnberry1906 @jessbrammar @realDonaldTrump @RaddSeiger She absolutely should return for the sake of her and her family's future because it would bring closure all round .... otherwise this will NEVER, EVER go away for the Sacoolas family.  If nothing else, do it for your children #AnneSacoolas .... #HarryDunn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Returning to the UK would bring closure for #AnneSacoolas &amp; the family of #HarryDunn, but it requires courage &amp; a good moral compass. Sadly, the cowardly path Sacoolas has chosen means that, for her, this will never go away .... it will haunt her for the rest of her life - good!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@playpictorial @SkyNews This poor, grieving family made it quite clear they wished to meet Sacoolas  if she would commit to returning to the UK .... Trump decided to ambush them instead, I am so glad they declined!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Apparently, people are sick of Brexit &amp; want it 'done' but that just won't happen bec, as mentioned below, 31st Oct is just the beginning of #Brexit, the ramifications, ripples &amp; subsequent recriminations will drag on for many years - only Remain makes the whole thing go away ...<|endoftext|>

Which MP? üòÇüòÇ Your tweets are very confusing Daniel .... üôÑ By the way, I think it's probably Johnson who, after yesterday's performance, is the standard bearer for hysterical meltdowns .... or, as I prefer to call them, hissy fits!! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, another Royal Wedding that the poor UK taxpayer will be forking out for.  Perhaps the time has come for the RF(particularly low ranking members) to pay for their own events. They can always crowdfund it &amp;, if you're a passionate Royalist, then you can donate #PrincessBeatrice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Not_Today_123 @BriefcaseMike Wow!! @Not_Today_123 .... bully adoration, sexist misogynism and bad grammar in one 21 word tweet - Well Done!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevemcnamara1 @BorisJohnson @BorisJohnson is modelling himself on Trump with his pathetic ranting &amp; raving .... he's had a shockingly bad start to his premiership and is becoming increasingly desperate .... he's the one who is embarrassing!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's very clear to see Johnson has spent time in Trump's company &amp; is following his model. The unapologetic and, frankly, vicious rhetoric of his speech in the HoC this afternoon was pure Trump .... I fear civil unrest is where we are headed  in both the UK &amp; USA #Brexit #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clover_mark @JuliaHB1 Rubbish!!  He's the best Speaker there's ever been ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hannah_MCurtis Johnson has got absolutely nothing to lose which is why he's being so vile!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My God!!  The term 'The Nasty Party' for the Tories took on a whole new meaning today .... they really are vile!! #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamieCorridon - This is not a proper verbatim transcript - The actual verbal tapes should be published - Trump asked a foreign country to investigate his upcoming pres election rival - Whistleblower complaint was suppressed - Like Watergate, this will become about the coverup #Impeachment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@David_Soffer @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn Well, according to you, everything .... but I think you're just being deliberately facetious there LOL #DramaQueen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simonmaginn Who cares ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@David_Soffer @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn No, not everything, but there was a time when the NHS (which is the envy if the world) and social care was much better funded .... and prescriptions were free .... and the education system was better funded .... all that has been slowly eroded by the nasty Tories ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlanSla90124663 Sure, bring it on ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steveErobinson Just in case ....  https://t.co/c74CzDmUR6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steveErobinson Ohh simply wonderful comeback!!  Do your knuckles also drag on the ground when you walk?? LOL!!  Bythe way, there's a terrific speech going on in Brighton atm .... you should and learn, Troglodyte!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlanSla90124663 Jeremy Corbyn is of the people and for the people .... unlike Boris Johnson and most Tories who come from very privileged backgrounds and ARE The Establishment ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LibDems No, you lot have just got it wrong!!  By threatening to 'force' Remain if you get into power, you're no better than the Tory extreme right wing.  I'm a remain voter but it NEEDS a properly-informed second final vote .... you are a party of carpetbaggers!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steveErobinson Yeahhh!! .... like Boris!! #ThereWeAreThen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlanSla90124663 I think Boris Johnson holds the gold standard for mistrust ....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Sophiesticatio2 Haha ... I will be economically fine too, love .... I voted remain but I'm happy to leave as long as we have a good deal in place .... forcing us to leave without a deal is not what people voted for ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grenjs Well, actually, I think a GE might happen now. There will be a vote of No Confidence in the gov when they resume business tomorrow &amp; that will trigger a GE. Labour have never been 'scared' of a GE but it needed to be done under the right circumstances .... timing is everything!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sophiesticatio2 Bit dramatic there lol .... Johnson tried to manipulate constitutional law and lied to the Queen - and got caught.  That's all that's happened .... crying that it's the end of Brexit is just silly and childish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iam40281352 The Government lied and have been brought to book.  That is all that has happened.  It is not the 'end of Brexit', but the Gov must not be bullyboys over it and do things properly .... that is what the ruling today is about.  This is not America and Johnson is not Trump!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grenjs So much has happened since 2016 &amp; people are much more aware of the ramifications of #Brexit, particularly a #NoDealBrexit, that there needs to be a second referendum so people can make a final INFORMED decision about Brexit .... democracy is everything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mindyois Do be sensible .... this is NOT about Brexit directly - we will, in all probability, still leave? This is about making sure the Government plays fair and doesn't 'cheat', Johnson clearly lied about the motivation &amp; purpose of the prorogation .... he should, therefore, resign!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Publish the phone call and then we'll all know .... except you won't!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RickMaskell @richardcalhoun @Keir_Starmer Rather the EU than Trump ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbclaurak Bedlam??  Bit of an overstatement there @bbclaurak .... of course, there were going to be some unhappy voices whichever way the vote went but, in reality, it passed fairly quickly .... it really doesn't help when the media ramp up the drama unnecessarily!! #DramaQueen<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just an observation, but not one mention of @joswinson &amp; LibDems conference in the headlines or front pages of the papers this morning .... hmmmm, wonder why?  Perhaps trying to portray themselves as an emerging force instead of the carpetbaggers they really are hasn't worked ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a ghost of a chance of this happening which is good because it would be very wrong to completely cancel Brexit just like that!!  It would be undemocratic and inviting civil unrest - and I say this as a passionate Remainer .... go away Libdems!!  https://t.co/EGWXGV7KK5  https://t.co/IXPBHkA091<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshuaRozenberg @SkyNews Many thanks Mr Rozenberg for your commentary of today's #SupremeCourt hearing .... I hope you will doing the same tomorrow - thanks again!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnDelacour @BorisJohnson @10DowningStreet Not what I saw ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HinmanMark He struck me as 'uncomfortable' and not having the true conviction of what he was saying ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else switching to the web #SupremeCourt hearing as @skynews &amp; @BBCNews have decided to be PC &amp; cover the boring @LibDems conference &amp; @joswinson speech? Bad move by them as the SC site appears to be close to crashing under the weight of those wishing to view the hearing!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nffcalways1 No, not really ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@groovereligion It normally takes months to prepare for a SC hearing; the parties involved in this hearing had just a few days to prepare.  So it is unsurprising if there are a few documental glitches .... they are coping with it well &amp; it is not detracting from the appellant's case so far ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nffcalways1 It normally takes months to prepare for a SC hearing, this one had just a few days, so it's unsurprising there are a few documental glitches .... but everyone there understands and they are coping with it well.  Also, it's 'heroes' btw  #SupremeCourt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katzenzungen No, it absolutely is not!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSqueee Guess it's horses for courses then, I'm finding it rivetting and incredibly interesting.  There's a strong possibility I may not leave the house for the next three days!!  #HistoryInTheMaking #PreservationOfDemocracy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@groovereligion It's incredibly interesting and rivetting viewing .... history in the making!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nffcalways1 Good grief!! .... I have to ask, do your knuckles also drag along the ground when you walk?  #HistoryInTheMaking #SupremeCourt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LawCharlies Tedious process??  It is rivetting and history in the making!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatieBarnard3 SC hearings normally take months of preparation, but this one has been prepared for very quickly in a matter of days, so it's unsurprising that there will be a few documental glitches .... everyone there understands that and they are coping well with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UB5simon I'm absolutely loving it!!  Watching the best legal minds in the country at work and history in the making ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshuaRozenberg Please ignore and keep threading .... thank you üòä<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenKentish Exactly!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Craig_Legs Not really .... it normally takes months to prepare for a SC hearing, this hearing has been put together very quickly and so it's no surprise there are some documental glitches given the amount of data involved - but they are coping with it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm a fairly passionate remainer, but even I can see how undemocratic the LDs cancelling #Brexit would be &amp; where it would lead as a consequence. In the current tinderbox atmosphere, I really think @joswinson should dial down her rhetoric, it makes her no better than Johnson ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bariweiss is totally offensive in so boldly stating that, IN HER OPINION, @jeremycorbyn is an antisemite!!  It does the Jewish community no favours at all to make such nasty, uninformed comments .... #billmaher #RealTime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patcondell It might have helped @patcondell if the Leave campaign had 'acted like adults' in the first place and not run their campaign on a bed of lies and misinformation .... #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Josemor11350147 @realDonaldTrump Nope, don't understand any of that ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@farroutman2003 @realDonaldTrump Alternative facts?? LOL ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@farroutman2003 @realDonaldTrump Bishop won, yes, but with a much reduced margin than 2016 .... that will (and should) concern and worry the GOP ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Josemor11350147 @realDonaldTrump It's North Carolina, Bishop won (by a much slimmer margin than 2016) because Trump has a hard core of voters there .... btw, no apostrophe required in your last word .... no worries though, most Trump supporters have poor English grammar skills .... üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Josemor11350147 @realDonaldTrump Yes, Bishop won but because NC is such a red state, it was unsurprising that he won .... it was a slim win compared to 2016 though, and that will worry the GOP By the way, Jose, you really need to sort your English out, love, it's 'should have', not 'should of'.... bad grammar üòä<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Josemor11350147 @realDonaldTrump Yes, of course, North Carolina is a very red state and Bishop should have won ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Josemor11350147 @realDonaldTrump Poor Jose .... so deluded!! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@farroutman2003 @realDonaldTrump Completely disagree ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jesco1 @eugenegu #Trump won fair &amp; square in 2016 because he tapped into the rustbelt states vote that HRC was ignoring. It was a cute move that won him the presidency. Fast forward 3 years and most ppl are realising that was all it was, a cute move &amp; he's a shocking POTUS, but 2020 beckons ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Bit of a reality check needed, #NorthCarolina is a very red state, GOP was SUPPOSED to win here &amp; no surprise it did. However, for such a red state, it was a narrow win, much reduced from 2016. #Trump may be celebrating but the GOP will be worried what this result means for 2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kaptain196 @JosephineFormby @ASCphiled 17.4M??  Doubtful, a lot of leave voters are pretty angry they were lied to i.e. ¬£350M a week saved that would go straight go the NHS - all lies .... plus, you need to factor in the people who've died since 2016 (old = leave)&amp; people who now old enough to vote (young = remain) üòÅ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kaptain196 @JosephineFormby @ASCphiled Ohh dear!!  You're clearly a very angry man ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosephineFormby Where on the ballot paper did it give the option of leaving with no deal?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosephineFormby Absolutely LOVE @johnbercow1 .... long may he stay on as Speaker of the House!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosephineFormby Me:  How dare these arrogant Tories prorogue Parliament (&amp; lie about the reason for it) in order to push through their Leave with  No Deal ........ WHICH NOBODY VOTED FOR!! New ref is needed with just two options .... Leave with No Deal or Remain #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kaptain196 @JosephineFormby @ASCphiled I think we're inching our way to that radical reform already .... by proroguing Parliament in the manner they have to facilitate a No Deal Brexit, the Tories have taken the first step towards the extreme right wing governance they crave .... #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosephineFormby Me:  Outraged at all the lies that were perpetrated three years ago to get a gullible, parochial (&amp; mostly racist) 52% of the country to vote the way they did .... and I definitely don't recall seeing Leave With No Deal on the ballot paper either!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitSmells @NadineDorries Only that the reporter was clearly at the wrong house and should have been standing outside No. 10 Downing Street .... it would suit the occupant far better üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElMarto001 @GMB No, they're more than happy to have an election AFTER the Brexit issue has been resolved one way or the other.  To use a GE to decide the fate of Brexit is plain wrong. If the Tories want to take the issue back to the people, it should be by way of a second ref - not a GE #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We need a 2nd ref with just two options: -  1.   Leave with No Deal on a named date 2.  Remain  The People have enough information now to make that decision and if they vote to Leave with No Deal, then so be it - that is true informed democracy &amp; the will of the People #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CliveWismayer @TheBrightonChap FYI .... @Channel4News @itvnews @BBCNews @SkyNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitGoat No, Johnson has tried to initiate a General Election, which is not required until AFTER the #Brexit mess has been sorted .... if he wants to offer the people an opportunity to have a final informed say on Brexit then it should be done through a second referendum .... #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@invictus_trader @CorbynASAP Oh he's got the balls .... and also the intelligence to push back on Bojo's desperate snap election request until this #Brexit mess is sorted because the Tories created it .... then we'll have an election  üòâ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LeeDeeble The people were lied to, so there needs to be a second referendum so people can make a fully informed decision regarding Brexit now they know what all the implications are .... if you are strong in your beliefs, you shouldn't be worried by a second PROPERLY INFORMED referendum<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jackpop27 There's nothing embarrassing about democracy .... no-one voted for a no-deal Brexit!!

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I know there's a count being kept of all the lies Spanky has spewed since being in office, but I REALLY hope someone is keeping a note of all his spelling mistakes, he's made some absolute gems .... and this is the President of the United States - what a complete wally!! üòÇüòÇ<|endoftext|>
