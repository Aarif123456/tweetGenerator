She talks about how dangerous Baltimore is &amp; says you need an armed guard to walk the streets, but she's going to volunteer her fat ass to help with a clean up in the city.

<|startoftext|>@LouisianaDan007 @seanmdav @mooselips That’s where you go wrong. You think that it’s us vs. them &amp; you are 100% right &amp; “they” are 100% wrong. You assume that we worship the Clintons &amp; Obama’s like you worship Trump. Wrong. We know that no one is perfect. Your lying @POTUS is nowhere near perfect. He is a narcissist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouisianaDan007 @seanmdav @mooselips Post proof, please. Oh, that’s right, you can’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouisianaDan007 @seanmdav @mooselips If Hillary had won we would still have allies, the debt &amp; deficit wouldn’t be through the roof due to a tax giveaway to the 1%, the environment would not be at risk due to deregulation, we’d still be in the Paris agreement &amp; Iran wouldn’t be capturing oil tankers. FU!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanmdav No dumbass. There was evidence, just not enough for a solid case, partly because they were stonewalled with “executive privilege”. There are ongoing investigations. As much as you wish, this is far from over. “No one is above the law.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanmdav Idiot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Hey #DiaperDonnie! Did you catch the part where he couldn’t answer some questions because of ongoing investigations?

<|startoftext|>@IsAHumanNotWolf @noveryfakenews @JustTheTweets17 She claimed Cruz was filing on her behalf. She even asked Biden for help. She craves attention.

<|startoftext|>@IsAHumanNotWolf @prddeplorable11 @JustTheTweets17 @FBI That’s all that matters to them. Like high school seniors bragging about how many signed their yearbook!

<|startoftext|>@joannafredjones @IlhanMN What? You don't know how to do a search? Waiting for others to "inform" you? She was accused of trespassing when she wouldn't leave a hotel.

<|startoftext|>@dino2573 @shaunking @theintercept I know that. You however make it sound like all of them enter illegally. That fits the MAGA agenda, so they’ll still be swearing in their Bibles that everyone who’s locked in cages are illegal, despite asylum requests.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hbadger26 @shaunking @theintercept You think violence is the only way. We’re supposed to have representatives to end this denial of human rights. You’re the ones bragging about how you’re armed to the teeth &amp; ready to roll. #MAGAts<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@THEHermanCain @JTweets2020 You’re an embarrassment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noveryfakenews @JustTheTweets17 @IsAHumanNotWolf 🤣😂🤣😂 Is she scared because she was in the crowd screaming along with the rest of the haters?

<|startoftext|>@JTweets2020 @JustTheTweets17 @realDonaldTrump LMAO! He didn't respond to your book. He didn't invite you to his "social media conference" after you begged for an invitation. When will you realize that he only cares about himself &amp; his rich criminal buddies? 🌊🌊🌊🌊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JTweets2020 @realDonaldTrump @JustTheTweets17 😂😂😂😂 There's a big difference between threatening to kill someone &amp; saying they shouldn't leave alive. One is a threat. The other is an opinion. Like saying the right won't take it sitting down &amp; declaring a second civil war.  #MAGALogic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noveryfakenews @JustTheTweets17 @IsAHumanNotWolf 🤣🤣 @Twitter is probably not pleased that she uses Twitter for free advertisement of her hilarious books.

<|startoftext|>@HollieWolfen They should be in the front row at his 4th of July celebration. WIth lots of press &amp; photographers. Then do it again if he's brave enough to debate whoever gets the Dem nomination. Escort them into all of his rallies with bodyguards.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MikeBDan @HobbsProlife A good job of alienating our allies, dividing our country, trying to destroy the free press (he now wants a government channel) &amp; making money off of foreigners seeking favors in his hotels. And you’re still afraid to answer my question.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MikeBDan @HobbsProlife You accused me of seeking government aid. I never have. You think all liberals are looking for handouts. We’re not. There are more people on the dole in red states.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeBDan @HobbsProlife You really need to read more. Your knowledge of human gestation is lacking. Stop listening to the science denying preachers &amp; the liar in chief who is clueless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeBDan @HobbsProlife Like the rich white boy who got away with rape?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeBDan @HobbsProlife So your daughter will have the rapists child. Got it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeBDan @HobbsProlife I’ve never even collected unemployment so don’t go there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeBDan @HobbsProlife You ASSume a lot. Remember, the subject was abortion, not government hand outs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeBDan @HobbsProlife You’re really getting off track. Would you let your 13 year old abort after rape? It’s a simple question. A yes doesn’t mean you support abortion as birth control. This isn’t about religion or government. It’s about never saying never.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZScienceDoc @bee_chelsea @HobbsProlife And you wouldn’t know because you weren’t there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZScienceDoc @bee_chelsea @HobbsProlife They’re one extreme. You are the other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeBDan @HobbsProlife It’s not a game. It’s a discussion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZScienceDoc @bee_chelsea @HobbsProlife They got you all fired up just like they wanted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeBDan @HobbsProlife You still didn’t answer. Abortion is a last resort. You act like pro choice people think it’s birth control. That’s not true. We are open minded enough to see that it is sometimes necessary, but you deny that &amp; I guess your 13 year old would suffer the consequences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeBDan @HobbsProlife And make her carry his spawn? That was the question you side stepped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeBDan @HobbsProlife You definition of viable is not scientific. If it can breathe on it’s own, it’s viable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZScienceDoc @bee_chelsea @HobbsProlife They’re yanking your chain &amp; you took the bait.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZScienceDoc @bee_chelsea @HobbsProlife OK. I can be the demon in your fairy tale.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZScienceDoc @bee_chelsea @HobbsProlife No. It means it’s not my business to tell anyone how to take care of their body.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @painter87048 @realDonaldTrump GFY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeBDan @HobbsProlife 2/2 Would you make your 13 year old be a rapist's incubator?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeBDan @HobbsProlife It's not a baby until it's born &amp; not viable until at least 20 weeks. Rapists getting lighter sentences since Trump.. They should serve time &amp; chemical castration when released. That won't solve everything since rape is about power &amp; he'll still attempt to overpower some way. 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeBDan @HobbsProlife Against abortion and for the death penalty. What a crazy world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HobbsProlife @felinefastlane @SaveThe1Child What are the stats for women who didn't abort the rapist's spawn? Right. You don't know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZScienceDoc @bee_chelsea @HobbsProlife No one is pro abortion. No one is out there begging women to abort. It's an issue that should be between a woman and her doctor. Very few, if any, would heal from the abuse by having their rapist's baby. Especially if she's still a child herself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bee_chelsea 2/2 without insurance goes through. If you had insurance or money, the experience would have been different. Did Jesus forgive all of the people that you claim encouraged/forced you to abort? You made your choice &amp; yet you would deny that option to others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bee_chelsea You asked them on social media instead of calling them like you did when you wanted an abortion. You did it on purpose, knowing that the PPA FB page is pro choice so you could start an argument &amp; claim they were being mean to poor you. You experienced what every other woman 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zentwittee @Brasilmagic If Trump or another MAGA said it. Everything else is a lie. 🤦‍♀️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnDavis2261 @MySweetLuke Fat chance of that happening when you have asshole judges granting visitation to rapists &amp; giving a slap on the wrist for rape. This isn’t about abortion, it’s about weak men trying to control women.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Erik_The_Legend @mitchellvii Right. They want smaller government, but not when it comes to controlling women.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RRRRMMMMM14 @RealMuckmaker @SenaSanders @SenBernie @WhiteHouse @RNC @realDonaldTrump You don’t have to shout. This was all theoretical.

<|startoftext|>@RRRRMMMMM14 @RealMuckmaker @SenaSanders @SenBernie @WhiteHouse So you’d stay home and risk 4 more years of Trump? That’s sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RRRRMMMMM14 @RealMuckmaker @SenaSanders @SenBernie If it comes down to that, and I pray it doesn’t, please vote. We can’t survive 4 more years of Trump. Even Bernie is better &amp; won’t try to circumvent the law or cause chaos like Trump.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Hemiheadx @Phylliseckhard1 @realJeffreyLord @RepJoeKennedy You are a fear monger like Trump who doesn't understand how effective that technology would be.

<|startoftext|>@US_POTUS_2020 @RepJoeKennedy The ones hand picked to speak?

<|startoftext|>@Hemiheadx @Phylliseckhard1 @realJeffreyLord @RepJoeKennedy What you can’t get through your thick MAGA skull is there are less expensive and more effective ways to protect the border.

<|startoftext|>@Nerothe3rd @lisamurkowski @POTUS That doesn't mean that I have to like him or support his insanity. I'll leave that to his low IQ, racist base, some of who may be furloughed civil servants trying to figure out how to pay their rent and feed their families.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2cents4change @SenSanders @DNC @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump Agreed. I will vote blue, no matter who. I don't think we should ignore what happened in 2016. We should learn from it. I only want us to stop rehashing it ad nauseam.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Nerothe3rd @lisamurkowski There's a big difference between a union striking and the moron in the WH shutting down the government in a tantrum. Unions strike for wages/benefits.

<|startoftext|>@krassenstein @LiberalsSuck321<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Go away. Far away. Like maybe Russia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiberalsSuck321 @Nancyanntaylor2 @loudlong Another armchair psychiatrist. Is your degree from Trump Umiversity?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiberalsSuck321 @Nancyanntaylor2 @loudlong Proof of all the bull💩 you've spewed in this thread. You accuse us of being communist, nazis &amp; more without proof &amp; now you're reduced to the old whatboutisms of #MAGAts. #MuellerKnowsEverything How about all of the indictments and the investigation into Trump charity, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiberalsSuck321 @Nancyanntaylor2 @loudlong You assume a lot. I am quite comfortable &amp; never had food stamps or any type of assistance. That's another lie Trump told you, when in fact, red states receive the most public assistance. Check out WV. Libraries don't censor material. I buy books, too.  https://t.co/wbnyYNbU5G<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanaAllenGwin1 @Nancyanntaylor2 @loudlong You’re a fool.🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nancyanntaylor2 @DanaAllenGwin1 @loudlong So true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanaAllenGwin1 @Nancyanntaylor2 @loudlong Proof of what you say, please? You do know what proof is, don’t you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanaAllenGwin1 @Nancyanntaylor2 @loudlong Unsophisticated &amp; uneducated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanaAllenGwin1 @Nancyanntaylor2 @loudlong Do you have a picture of that? I didn’t think so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanaAllenGwin1 @Nancyanntaylor2 @loudlong Still no proof. The lady that called the cops on a man for using the pool in his apartment complex. She was not paid. The woman that reported a neighbor’s BBQ was not paid. Charlottesville protesters not paid. At least one lost his job. Another murdered Heather Heyer. SMH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanaAllenGwin1 @Nancyanntaylor2 @loudlong You still have nothing though I gave you facts. Now you’re trying to deflect with family history. Your family fought. Trump’s family dodged. Come on. Prove your accusations. Oh. That’s right. You can’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiberalsSuck321 @Nancyanntaylor2 @loudlong And suddenly you are a psychiatrist diagnosing from afar. 🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanaAllenGwin1 @Nancyanntaylor2 @loudlong How so? You make a lot of accusations without any credible evidence, whereas we have seen Charlottesville, the MAGAs that have been arrested for hatred.  The pool lady, the idiot that reported a BBQ &amp; more. Racism on the right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattStout07 @realDonaldTrump More ignorant than we could ever have imagined.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiberalsSuck321 @Nancyanntaylor2 @loudlong So what would you call the Charlottesville protesters wearing swastikas &amp; carrying torches? Nice people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiberalsSuck321 @Nancyanntaylor2 @loudlong Again you have no proof or anything intelligent to add to the conversation. You can only parrot what other #MAGAs say. You can’t tell a lie from the truth or you wouldn’t support Trump. He told soldiers they haven’t had a raise in years &amp; he’s giving them a 10% raise. All lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanaAllenGwin1 @Nancyanntaylor2 @loudlong We are Americans. You are close minded. Pity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiberalsSuck321 @Nancyanntaylor2 @loudlong LOL! When #MAGAts have nothing substantive to say they resort to name calling. So sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VirtualUnwinds @loudlong @honorablemdwife Yet she's still standing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwampyTrump Plus you know he’ll talk about how great he is &amp; how much we need a wall. Real morale booster.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Look! There's a shut down! Who did that? The House &amp; Senate had a bipartisan plan that they sent to Trump. Why would he veto it? Oh, right. His racist, hateful, #MAGAt, minority base wants to throw away our taxes on an unnecessary, useless wall! 😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Just SHUT UP!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump America may be, but you're not respected. 🤥🤥🤥<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sarah12646 @senatemajldr @POTUS So you’re urging him to change the rules mid game so the hateful, racist, fake Xtian minority can waste our taxes on a useless wall instead of feeding &amp; sheltering the homeless &amp; caring for vets. #DeplorableMAGAts #TrumpResign<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@txgal529 @Rischla @realDonaldTrump I bet the "facts" your search engine finds all right wing. Sad. I research, too.

<|startoftext|>@CindyCoops @punwithwordz @mj_lee @abbydphillip If Kavanaugh wouldn’t balk at talking to the FBI, he wouldn’t have refused to answer when asked to request an FBI investigation. You must have failed Logic 101.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CindyCoops @punwithwordz @mj_lee @abbydphillip No, apparently I’m talking to a brick wall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC Misogynistic scum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Az61Ronin @mj_lee @seungminkim I watched the hearing. He lied about frequency. He lied about the legal drinking age. Others have come forward to verify his excessive drinking. He was anything but calm and cooperative. He screamed &amp; cried and you still want him to get a lifelong SC seat. Sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CindyCoops @punwithwordz @mj_lee @abbydphillip Talk about absurd!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CindyCoops @mj_lee @yashar Kavanaugh thought he was safe in saying he would talk to anyone because the @GOP was going to ensure that he wouldn't have to answer any more questions. He just couldn't bring himself to ask for an FBI investigation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SueinRockville @TomNamako @ZoeTillman The drinking age was raised in 1982 in MD. It was probably a typo.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RRRRMMMMM14 @nytimes @potus45 2/2 "For them, it will never be enough - stay tuned and watch!" This tells me that he never broadened the scope &amp; yesterday's tweet was more BS. Why else would he bother tweeting this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnCoulter GFY.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RRRRMMMMM14 @nytimes @potus45 Today's tweet:   Wow! Just starting to hear the Democrats, who are only thinking Obstruct and Delay, are starting to put out the word that the “time” and “scope” of FBI looking into Judge Kavanaugh and witnesses is not enough. Hello! 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SocialPowerOne1 It was heart breaking all right! It broke my heart to see that pig screaming like the entitled brat he is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HollieWolfen Or Infowars.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MorozMichael @SHolden2009 @Fuzzy_Fuzzbutt @TheBreen @ElizabethReilly @GalarneauScot @realDonaldTrump He lied. I was under the impression that they were talking about Kavanaugh since Graham is already saying he will vote yes unless the FBI can prove a more serious crime than sexual assault. That’s disgusting. The man obviously has anger issues in addition to his alleged assaults.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump He said the opposite today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MorozMichael @SHolden2009 @Fuzzy_Fuzzbutt @TheBreen @ElizabethReilly @GalarneauScot @realDonaldTrump The constitution provides for impeachment. I see another up and coming Republican misogynist here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElizabethReilly @GalarneauScot @Fuzzy_Fuzzbutt @realDonaldTrump It will be a shame if we have to waste time and money impeaching his sorry ass after the blue wave in November. It will be worth it, though.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IanMCallander @JustTheTweets17 No reponses, either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanMCallander @JustTheTweets17 @cvpayne @realDonaldTrump I’ve already read his tweets on here  &amp; I’d be embarrassed to put the other book on my coffee table.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanMCallander @JustTheTweets17 @cvpayne @realDonaldTrump Ask her if she’s ever voting for anyone but a Republican. She bad mouthed Cruz during primaries &amp; now acts like he’s God compared to Beto. It’s called analysis, not assumption. She ASSumes that any Republican is better than a Democrat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanMCallander @JustTheTweets17 @cvpayne @realDonaldTrump Her entrepreneurial adventure may be limited. There’s nothing wrong with creating a business. It’s the fact that she’s selling Trump’s angry twitter rants as though it’s the Bible. She is a prime example of party over country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanMCallander @JustTheTweets17 @cvpayne @realDonaldTrump Entrepreneur or opportunist? One thing's for sure. The issues don't really matter to her. She will follow a Republican over a cliff before voting any other way. That's close minded. You want to be her PR guy, right? Or a future vote?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanMCallander @JustTheTweets17 @cvpayne @realDonaldTrump Me, too.  https://t.co/ErEeWXPwyR<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IanMCallander @virginiahume Actually, I didn't. Weird. A bad algorithm in Twitter?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanMCallander One of the most respected journalists, who also helped break Watergate. But you want to demean him for reporting on Trump's WH. It's so funny that you all think everyone is conspiring against @POTUS.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IanMCallander @JustTheTweets17 @cvpayne @realDonaldTrump I also have issues with people like JustTheTweets17 tweeting that this is not a monarchy when someone suggested Cindy McCain to fill her husband's Senate seat. So what about Ivanka &amp; Jared? Cindy McCain is probably more politically savvy than them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanMCallander @JustTheTweets17 @cvpayne @realDonaldTrump They are Americans and do affect my life. They voted for the most unqualified presidential candidate ever. He has alienated our allies, is encouraging the destruction of the environment &amp; trying to take away health care from the poor &amp; middle classes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PressSec How incredibly insulting to Americans that you think we believe your bull💩. My children &amp; grandchildren will remind you children and grandchildren of what a lair you were for the Moron in Chief.  https://t.co/1D9WjWpreK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lisalove1107 @hauxrj @Texastrue11 @EricTrump @MichaelDelauzon @realDonaldTrump I'm concerned that some Americans take Trump's word as gospel truth when he is a proven liar. How ahve we been abused? Please give proof &amp; references.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lisalove1107 @hauxrj @Texastrue11 @EricTrump @MichaelDelauzon @realDonaldTrump In what way? It's interesting that you make statements without presenting proof. Following Trump's lead.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lisalove1107 @hauxrj @Texastrue11 @EricTrump @MichaelDelauzon @realDonaldTrump I think that Trump has started a trade war that will not bode well for us. Doesn't it send up a red flag for you when his tariffs don't affect his or Ivanka's businesses? Are you not concerned that our allies now hate us? Harley Davidson is leaving. So will others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@teriobrien @Dawn_DeMore1 @GenFlynn @BarbaraRedgate @JosephJFlynn1 @FlynnJack515 @Real_PeachyKeen @KatTheHammer1 And if you read it correctly it's saying that people will plead guilty out of fear of negative outcome &amp; that includes SOME that are innocent. So the rest plead because they ARE GUILTY.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@teriobrien @Dawn_DeMore1 @GenFlynn @BarbaraRedgate @JosephJFlynn1 @FlynnJack515 @Real_PeachyKeen @KatTheHammer1 Under what circumstances?

<|startoftext|>@OilmanMonte @treecarverbill @frfrankpavone You just don’t get it &amp; never will. It’s not your body. It is the law which doesn’t force any woman to have an abortion. Don’t like it. Don’t have an abortion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dawn_DeMore1 @teriobrien @GenFlynn @BarbaraRedgate @JosephJFlynn1 @FlynnJack515 @Real_PeachyKeen @KatTheHammer1 LOL! He pleaded guilty! Innocent people don't plead guilty. Pray for a lenient sentence if you must.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OilmanMonte @treecarverbill @frfrankpavone It’s pro choice not pro abortion. Big difference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@teriobrien @treecarverbill Because the Supreme Court already decided. BTW: Trump picked him because he is on record as saying a sitting president can’t be sued in civil court or face criminal charges. Trump is scared 💩less.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StatesRights420 @Texastrue11 @HollyNiotti You can't be serious or your social circle was small. So they don't have Black Baptist &amp; White Baptist churches? They aren't cheering for the end of DACA? And none of them ever made crude remarks about any of the Obamas?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StatesRights420 @HippyGranny2 @Texastrue11 @HollyNiotti The Americans that are disgusted by his election far outnumber you. It was a character test.

<|startoftext|>@StatesRights420 @HippyGranny2 @Texastrue11 @HollyNiotti Several issues. First, why waste money when you can get it for free?
