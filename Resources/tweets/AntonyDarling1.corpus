<|startoftext|>@utd_77 @OleGlazer Course it’s not ok. No one would think that a win against tranmere would now mean that the club is no longer broken. This still means you can be happy and celebrate a goal when we do score. Not a single penny of me watching United today has gone into the pockets of the glazers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OleGlazer @utd_77 You both make a sweet couple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@utd_77 @OleGlazer I’m anti glazer too, but I still support the team.   And it’s a saying knobhead, means you’re a bit of a sad cunt.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DevilsOfUnited Shows glimpses of a great footballer, but overall not good enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RiZzyUTD Well he could hardly let the ball hit him in the face could he!!?? There would be puss everywhere!!!  https://t.co/oCdWcEeP5V<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Glad he is dead, let’s just hope it fuckin hurt when that bullet went in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MUFCCoIeman Lukaku has also had some shocking moments at Inter. It’s a rebuild at United which should of started years a go and either from managerial errors or useless pricks like Woodward we are now in this position.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MUFCCoIeman He can but most likely won’t. Gotta start looking at the bigger picture from tonight’s game, I couldn’t give two shits how Roma, Inter or any of their players got on.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FootballGrf @PerdiswellColts Tigers U12 had a great 2-1 win.

Current top bid is £150. 👍⚽️  https://t.co/ePJ4TrYYx7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DevilsOfUnited No. He cane from a wank league so u had to give him some time to adjust, but he has had that time now and is simply offering nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MUFCScoop  https://t.co/DLejAxBDKH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s like the players have no desire to score goals, let alone win a game. I’m sure that’s not the case but that’s the impression from these players. #ManUtd #GlazersOut #PullYourFuckinFingerOut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@avfcjonny @harby001 @Adam_darling10<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So today I met this Legend. Top fella and helped me out with some fundraising by signing a shirt. #ManUtd #scholsey #MUFC_FAMILY  https://t.co/gAEHCumpKF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ManUtd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/mw2YNWk8Nu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So please, start bidding. Whoever has the top bid by midday on Tuesday 8th will get this unique item...cmon...when will you ever again get chance to have a PCFC top signed by an England and Man Utd legend?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today I knew I was going to be seeing the legend that is Paul Scholes at work so I messaged him and asked if he would be happy to help out by signing a PCFC shirt to auction off and get a little bit more money for Oscar. He was happy to help out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the last few weeks @PerdiswellColts have been fundraising for Hand In Hand for Oscar in order for this brave little fella to get the treatment he needs abroad to help him beat leukaemia.

<|startoftext|>@HMFAhorrorfan @Shudder_UK Yeah I’m tempted to give it a go, I can get a 7 day trial so will see what I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HMFAhorrorfan Question for you all, thinking of getting @Shudder_UK mainly at the moment for the creepshow series but is it something worth keeping long term? Love my horror but just wondered if it was full of low budget stuff or not? 👍🤡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the_brewersarms What’s the point in VAR if they can’t overturn an obvious handball. Shows with the arsenal goal that it can work but can’t see how the penalty can’t be looked at and given. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@McTominayisBae Totally agree. Transfer window is now shut and we have the team that we have.

Would of been nice to see a creative midfielder come in but it didn’t happen so let’s crack on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanMUFC7115 Agree m8, if we have the midfield to feed the front men we have then I don’t think a lukaku replacement is required at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dybala and Juventus just fucking people about now. #GlazersOut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanMUFC7115 Not a bad shout, if he gets decent minuets he will defo get into double figures at least.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Adam_darling10 @McTominayisBae I do want #GlazersOut m8, they are parasites. But the shit the team gets from some supporters b4 the season has already started is awful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Loved the first film, hope this one is as good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McTominayisBae I gotta follow u...it’s like u have been in my head!!! The negativity from some “supporters” before the season has even started is ridiculous.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@logiebear196725 I think Fred needs one more season to see what he has got, And I think McTominay will play more this year too. If they bring in Fernandez then I will be happy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logiebear196725 I’m only messing m8. But only think we need to replace one of them unless pogba did go of course.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mark_Champ20ns Get behind him dude. Gotta give the fella a season to see what he does. The few months he had last season was never gonna be a true rejection of what he can do.

<|startoftext|>#Pogba is gonna leave this summer, that appears obvious now after his latest comment. On his day he is the best but if u only see his day in spits and spats then we might as well cash in and build a new midfield. #MUFC_FAMILY<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PSx2HD @PSJ4U When it was the sly sports stream it was amazing, but since that went down and replaced by DAZN then it’s been poor. Can anything be done? All efforts appreciated guys. 👍👌<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ATRboxinguk I think if this fight of happened in Tyson’s prime then wilder would of got his death in the ring...unfortunately for him he would be the one being zipped up.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RuairiMcNulty1 @JohnFar51714154 @DillianWhyte @BronzeBomber Fair enough, it still puts him in a better position to be getting a shot against wilder than some of his other opponents have done over the last couple of fights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RuairiMcNulty1 @JohnFar51714154 @DillianWhyte @BronzeBomber So being ranked number 1 means.....???<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RedDevil7115 Agreed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthewgleslie I remember thinking the same about “IT”. When I heard it was being remade I was gutted as loved the original. I then watched the original and some of the acting was awful. If it wasn’t for Tim Curry’s performance as Pennywise it would be worse!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GedAshtonged8 @PLANSTEEAM @PLSTHD 😂💩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GedAshtonged8 @PLANSTEEAM @PLSTHD Shit down? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GedAshtonged8 @PLANSTEEAM @PLSTHD I believe is the same. They move around quite a bit so not to get shit down so gotta keep an eye on it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DissectMUFC Yeah and he did ok when coming on too. Great to see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Arsenal didn’t deserve that win, but that’s what happens if u don’t take your chances. Ref was awful and gave some terrible decisions against both teams.   #InOleWeTrust<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@avfcjonny @harby001 So not only do they have cunt fans but they also employ cunt staff too!!  Glad your guys won. 👍⚽️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ManUtdMindset 3-1 United.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenMUFC4 To some like minded fans he will be a hero, so as soon as a supporter crosses the line like this it should be an instant ban for all fans of that team home and away for several games. These people won’t be so well liked then if their actions stops other from watching their team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@avfcjonny @harby001 @Adam_darling10  https://t.co/lp7uI2wx9l<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So glad that #grealish scored the winner for villa against the blues. Makes the assault and arrest of the spastic blues fan completely snd utterly more pointless then it ever was to begin with.   #itsagameoffootball #somefansaredicks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leedablue @charlottecrid What? Football matches? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leedablue I’m sure u all do. 😂 I hate Liverpool FC and some of their fans are awful, but would I expect a fan to run on a launch Salah? No chance. That blues fucktard could of had a knife!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@avfcjonny @harby001 check out the subtitles. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fucking disgusting, should be an automatic stadium ban for all blues fans for the rest of the season. That would stop this retard kissing to the crowd when every other blues fan is banned from games too, they would hate him for it.   I’m a neutral but I hope villa stuff them now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedDevil7115 I grew up trying to perfect the mark hughes Volley. But I must go with Paul Scholes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DissectMUFC I would go with Sanchez in that Number 10 role. It’s not working for him playing wide so it could be what he needs to actually start his United career. But mata is a good shout too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FreddysMuse The remake....just like any other remake needs to be so awesome in order to knock an original out of the water. It didn’t quite do that for me but was still a decent watch.   Plus the gratuitous naked shower scene at the start sways my opinion a little too. 😉<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Doozer34 Any idea if the United v Newcastle game being shown on any other channel other than sly?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DevilsOfUnited @ManUtd Yeah I can’t see a clean sheet here but I suppose as long as we score more then it’s job done. I’m going for 3-1 United.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ManchesterIsRE0 Why u not following back?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SayNoMore33 So the managers give out all their tactics said at training and before games to the press? Doubt it m8. They may generalise how they want to play but no more. But either way united are scoring, creating chances and currently winning so I say it again...just enjoy it!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SayNoMore33 I don’t understand why these debates are still going? None of us have any idea on what Jose or OGS have said to the teams so why people think they know this is beyond me. Just be happy that the mood and football has changed for whatever reason and enjoy it!! #MUFC_FAMILY<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chrisdsmith32 @Doozer34 @DigibitUK Message @DigibitUK m8. They will talk you through the process. It’s not difficult at all and they are a good bunch so will be happy to help you out. It’s worth doing for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Doozer34 @DigibitUK VPN is well worth it m8, and with the latest update it just connects automatically so when u turn on your device it just kicks in. £2 a month is nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@avfcjonny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Doozer34 @dannyb1987 If your not happy then your not happy m8, that’s your right. But to do something that potentially ruins it for those who are happy with the service is a bit of a dick move. It’s was shite tonight yes, I had a back up and got back onto doozer once it was sorted. #doozeriptv<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Doozer34 No, VPN on and still stuck on refresh channels (network error)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Doozer34 I will try again now but my VPN is always on and I didn’t connect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Doozer34 Not letting me refresh channels, getting network error message.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just caught up with #WildMantoIronMan and fair play @pritchardswyd for smashing that challenge.

<|startoftext|>@Doozer34 Well done m8. 👍🍺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂 quality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mtungwaq @markgoldbridge Because they want to do a proper recruitment process rather than just get someone who is just available. The person they might really want may be some one like Poch (🙏) who wouldn’t just leave mid season but may be available in the summer.  Be happy it’s being done properly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markgoldbridge With the right style of football, Lukaku will score a shit load of goals. Matic can defo do one though. ⚽️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@utdxtra Apparently this was soon deleted off the website, as was a twitter post from the prime minister of Norway wishing Ole good luck. Seems to of been a lot of this posting then quickly deleting going on today. #circus #letsjustgetonwithit #MUFC_FAMILY<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ImpressionistAL I would see if Southgate wanted it on a temp basis. With no major tournament this summer it could suit him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markgoldbridge First thing u have said for a while that I can 100% agree with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Souness being spoken to about Jose sacking on Sky now...how long before he blames pogba? #MUFC_FAMILY<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Doozer34 Yeah it’s all back m8.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lukecompton2010 @RayOli87 @Doozer34 Yes m8 and when I tried refreshing playlist I was getting a network error. All back up now though. Hopefully that’s the last down time this game. 🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lukecompton2010 @RayOli87 @Doozer34 Yeah it is what it is m8. Like u said very frustrating for such a massive game but it’s usually spot on so just gotta keep them fingers crossed that it kicks back in soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Doozer34 Im down with everything, can’t even refresh the channels. Everyone else the same?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RayOli87 @Doozer34 And lost it all again. 😫<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RayOli87 @Doozer34 Ok, at least I know it’s not just something my end. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Doozer34 I’m loosing streams @Doozer34, will that be because of the work being done on VOD?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Doozer34 @DigibitUK I’ve messaged them via FB before and they have always got back in touch with me within a few hours at most.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BronzeBomber This clock is completely irrelevant. If fury was going by your clock then he would of got up half a second earlier as he has said he took as much time as he could to get his legs. This is really clutching at straws to justify your draw...which should of been a loss. 🤦🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RV1897 @FullTimeDEVILS 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RV1897 @FullTimeDEVILS Exactly what you put except Sanchez is not in the squad. So with that I would put rashford through the middle and have lingard our wide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnitedPrime_7 Yep, the 3 points are the important thing. Would still be great to see them put on a show though...not holding my breath on that one. 😒<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnitedPrime_7 If we are not confident on beating young boys at home then we shouldn’t even be in the competition. But recent performances are unfortunately making fans feel less confident. I’m going for 2-0 United.   #MUFC #mufcfamily #ChampionsLeague<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FullTimeDEVILS Awful football, it’s the same shit every week and some think that just because we have had a good 30 mins during a game and got a win or just because we got a lucky win at Juve that we are still going strong...news flash...we are not.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ManUtd Put them in tomorrow’s squad, might do better than our current crop of players. 😒<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnitedPrime19 Agreed, seemed off the pace this season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnitedPrime19 I want to support Jose, I can’t help but like the fella. But the style of play is not good. Even games we win I feel very frustrated with how little we create. Maybe we have been spoilt over the last few year I don’t know, but something needs to change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCSport It will look like Barca v Madrid....but with no Messi or Ronaldo!!!! 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A few of these lads could defo get into our first team at the mo, would love to see them not only playing but also playing this attacking style of football!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bud_cann @the_brewersarms Retired Boxer from the Uk I think is more accurate. I think he did serve in the armed forces but not in USA and this was a few years back now.   Either way, fair play to the old fella for stoving that little cunts head in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ManUtd No we didn’t, we fought them for about 20 mins through the whole game!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FullTimeDEVILS @RedSandstorm Just not good enough, simple as that. Is it the players? Is it the manager? Who knows but the performance is nothing more than I’ve been used to seeing this season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@utdxtra Less than average. Proof we are not on the same level. Hopefully the 2nd half display will prove me wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>31 mins in and we realise we are allowed to attack if we want to!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ImpressionistAL Need a full game like we did 2nd half on Saturday. Play this first half like we did at Chelsea and Ronny will get a hatrick.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@England 1st half, our midfield didn’t seem to know they could pass forward. When they realised they could in the 2nd half then the strikers let them down. Rashford should of has 2, Kane should of also scored.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@UnitedStandMUFC I think they should change it to a red if it’s missed, but leave it as a yellow if they score. But seeing as the refs struggle to see obvious wrestling in the box sometimes I’m guessing that rule would be too confusing for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sportspunditusa If they are confident then that is surely a good thing? Would u want them to go into the game with no confidence?<|endoftext|>

Don’t usually do a year but for £20 u can’t moan and can’t fault it so far. I’ve talked with a few other providers and will probably take out another sub as back up but not until closer to the prem season. But message @TargetIptv, 👌 deals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnnyDay79 @IPTV_Help @TargetIptv @finesseiptv @LimitlessTeeVee @infinity_iptv @vaderstreamstv @EvolutionIPTV @Sergi0Aguero16 Yeah I always did a month and was with them for 7 months. My sub ran out out on the 4th and they extended to 7th as PayPal would be back in. When it wasn’t I asked if it could be extended again, told no. I then asked if PayPal was defo coming back got booted with 1 day sub left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TargetIptv I’ll have 2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sportspunditusa @UnitedStandMUFC I’m happy there are no expectations on the squad, if we can get to the QF’s then that’s got to be looked at as being a decent World Cup. As long as they give it everything then no one can moan.<|endoftext|>

And I know that others did too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IPTV_Help @TargetIptv @finesseiptv @LimitlessTeeVee @infinity_iptv @vaderstreamstv @EvolutionIPTV @Sergi0Aguero16 I knew they were just playing their customers off on the idea it would be back up...glad I’m out.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IPTV_Help That 2nd PayPal account is still yet to happen, I really think that they are telling customers it’s coming in to keep them around but it will never happen.

<|startoftext|>@merriman02 @flawlessiptv Ok cheers Paul, will have a look at half time as it is just watchable.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@flawlessiptv It was using the sly channels, appears to be ok now though. Lets hope it stays like this now for the rest of the day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flawlessiptv It’s back up but buffering like crazy. Now there is every chance that it’s my end but as you cannot message anyone to ask the question I’m not sure. How is everyone else’s now playing?<|endoftext|>
