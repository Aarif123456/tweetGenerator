<|startoftext|>@GovRonDeSantis @FLCaseyDeSantis I wonder if today it the day that you will decide that carrying the water for Trump is too great a burden.

<|startoftext|>@GovRonDeSantis @FLCaseyDeSantis I wonder if that pressure in my chest for the last four days is Covid.

<|startoftext|>@GovRonDeSantis @FLCaseyDeSantis You need to do the right thing.  Just because you are in a position of power you don't have to use it for evil.

<|startoftext|>@cwebbonline @SassERevere There is some talk that he is 17 from Illinois. Crossing State line with Firearm.  Open Carry in Wisconsin is 18.   He was not protecting his community. He came to kill someone. Now he will be charged with murder.<|endoftext|>
