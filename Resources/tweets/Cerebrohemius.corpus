<|startoftext|>However, I disagree with Klopp's take on Chelsea having the best squad. It's a bit of gamesmanship and taking the attention away from Liverpool and passing it on to another team. Chelsea have a very good squad but young in age and pedigree.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@slicesofIife Fair point. Just a week ago, Lampard was like no injuries and it felt so good. Pulisic's recurring injuries are worrisome.  Fine margins between challenging for the title and ending up top 4 I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚ô•Ô∏è #Chelsea under Carlo Ancellotti in 2009/10 is the best I've seen them play ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slicesofIife Yup, tactical error in Havertz playing out wide + Havertz looked really off today. Having said that, Everton completely nullified whatever we threw at them, which wasn't a lot to begin with. Gotta write it off and move on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Correct, measured analysis. Poor game. It happens. Keep the faith and on we go! üí™<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slicesofIife We start with a loss at Goodison even before the season schedule is confirmed. Amazing consistency, unfortunately.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@therealbennyman You're probably right. We are very polarized right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbennyman I trust Republicans are better than this. I know they are better than this. Deep down, they know they made a mistake in 2016. Trump is rotten.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This country needs to heal. I hope the next four years under  #Biden is boring as fuck. I'm done dealing with stupid noise coming from the WH every fucking waking moment. #Elections2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chaoticbuddhaa No, they can't, sadly :( They were mathematically out of contention for playoffs last week. However, there are still two spots open for which 3 teams are competing. Very close!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Catch of the tournament by a mile from DK. #IPL2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chaoticbuddhaa Yeah, I am! A welcome distraction in a tough year. My team is CSK and they were the first to get eliminated! :\<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@therealbennyman Nothing scientific in my take but I‚Äôm done with these polls‚Äô projections for a Biden win. The water cooler conversation here in Michigan is strictly pro-Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jazz_CB Just a gut feel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've seen enough: we are going to have a historic polling error and #Trump is gonna win again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't emphasize this enough: thank goodness for #IPL to be a welcome distraction in a very, very tough year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yup, amazing cricket. Hope he has a bright future for #India. #CSK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Chelsea's result against this revitalized #Southampton looks like a great point. #Hasenhuttl is a top, top manager.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Solid end to the tournament for #CSK. #Ruturaj has played more textbook shots than any other player in the tournament and he's only played 4-5 games. One for the future!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo @awprokop Good point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Yeah, I'll find that to be strange too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Dude, I don't care about whether he's the best or not. I am not talking about his merit or demerit. I find it off a manager is tweeting that one when there's another keeper in the team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That idiot from #Lokomotiv could have easily squared the ball to the guy making the run from the center. Pathetic awareness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Don't give a shit about lies or truth. As a coach, I find it super odd that he would single out one player and heap praise on him when there's another keeper in the squad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is this guy the coach of the Indian side? lol Who tweets like this? lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This happens so often. Two batsmen go crazy at the top and give a launch pad only for the following batsmen to flounder. Amazingly, DC are still in with a chance. #IPLT20<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The real rivalry. #IPLT20<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Add Tyagi to that list. Kid has pace, that's about it. Maybe I'm being too harsh on these guys when Hardik, Pollard come at you lol.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#RR have had better players than #CSK yet they are languishing at the bottom.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Hasenh√ºttl is a top, top manager. #Southampton haven't started the season well but they are clicking into gear. Won't be a bad target for #Chelsea when Lampard inevitably gets the boot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aha_irshi I mean, we can only say it from here as we are fans :) Yes, it was awful bowling to a guy who can strike well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Calm down lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Give the title to #MI already. No team stands a chance even on #MI's bad day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hardik's power hitting is great. Didn't need to do much in this tournament. But boy, that was seriously rubbish bowling to Hardik.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aha_irshi Agreed. Awful bowing to Hardik's strengths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor Rajpoot. Someone was going to get smacked by Pollard or Pandya.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is that not a clear and obvious error from the ref? #SOUEVE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well done, #CSK. Good win after eons!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course, Dhoni has to live up to his brand of finishing shit in the 18th over lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Adi da Dhoni<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well done, Ruturaj!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InnoBystander Much like Watson‚Äôs innings, his good points come once in a blue moon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now Rayudu deciding to join the party too.  Confident stuff right from the top! There‚Äôs the intent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ruturaj‚Äôs shots should make him a candidate for India‚Äôs Test team. Quality innings so far!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelMatteoRo The Shawshank Redemption. Lost count of how many times I've rewatched it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Without doubt, Warnie!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's like Barcelona managers are contractually obliged to whine about VAR or something. Lol!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ditto. This is a good result. 3rd clean sheet since Mendy and Silva debuted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No wonder the guy doesn't get to start.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Ajax scored HOW MANY?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meanwhile Sevilla continue their domestic slide. #LaLigaSantander<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like both Ole and Lampard read @MiguelDelaney's piece about having some solidity and anyone could win the league Loll<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mendy. Well done! #CFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No doubts about that penalty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slicesofIife For sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slicesofIife While your larger point about Barca managing their finances and players poorly, Griezman has deteriorated exponentially since becoming a Barca player. Benching him tonight was justified.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two crap teams defending like crap. #ElClasico<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Streaming services should provide an option to mute Ray Hudson automatically. Garbage commentary. #ElClasico<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>ESPN+, Fanatiz, Peacock, NBC -- you need to shell out a shit ton to watch European soccer in the US.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Painful innings from Pant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Foden is decent. Any comparison to Silva is premature, though. Won‚Äôt do him any good either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@netcitizen I‚Äôm sure they carry blank, nameless T-Shirts. They also might carry individual alphabets that they can stick on to create custom T-shirt.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Question for #ElClasico: Will Messi bother to run? Will Zidane give a shit or continue to milk his success from years past? Two mediocre, sloppy teams go against each other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These two are playing textbook T20 cricket. Counter attack and throw everything at it from both ends. #IPL2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Leeds were amazing today. Turned up and how! #PremierLeague<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Curran, well played, mate! #IPL2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have all the sympathy for the new guys who failed today. It's okay, it happens. Dhoni's spark comment was wrong, no matter what he intended by it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dhoni playing the role of Messi in this tournament. Disinterested, not giving a fuck. Ready with an excuse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hardik looks like an extra on The Boys who gets 10s of screentime before getting killed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CSK have quickly reached Barcelona against Bayern levels here. They'd rather be anywhere than be on the field.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Simon Doull comes across as a dick even when he commentates. Hardly a surprise it's showing up on Twitter too. Very holier than thou vibes from him during commentary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two international bowlers causing havoc against an out of sorts batting order. No surprises. This game was over before the tournament began.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Fuck Mumbai Indians lol. After praising them, feels nice to tweet this out for sure. Punjab what are you man? Someone terminate their franchise contract lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryLineker @IPL Yes, Gary. It‚Äôs mental.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yup, once again, their belief and ability trumps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mumbai Indians will cruise this super over with Bumrah on fire.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4 from 4. Only Punjab can lose from there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>West Ham ending and now IPL ending. I have no dog in either games but wow my heart can‚Äôt deal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs a garbage over that Punjab should have got more from. Missed out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just Bumrah things. Well played Rahul! Only so much you can do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The best league in the world! That‚Äôs more like the West Ham from over the past 2 weeks. Moyes jokes out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lol Punjab is shite. Also, Rohit is a good captain but he has the luxury of having Bumrah when your other international spearhead has an off day. Serious depth, not just fluffy depth but top, current international regular performers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kkfla737 Fair enough. Despite fixture congestion, #Spurs are not only surviving but thriving. Kane playing deep seems to have unlocked something for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kkfla737 Getting carried away there, mate. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah ok, 'this' West Ham showed up today. Been a while.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It hurts to even type it but there's an air of Man United under Ferguson about this Mumbai side. Deep belief meets talent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This game was beyond Punjab once Mumbai reached 140. Now, they can boost their already strong NRR when they inevitably thrash Punjab. #IPL2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Punjab‚Äôs fielding, god awful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brighton play like Madrid but they finish like Chelsea with Shevchenko leading the attack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ishan Kishan is crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Punjab fielding like...a team at the bottom of the table. Even they are surprised by their 2 wickets at this stage lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Teams batting first in super overs have a distinct disadvantage I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe Samad shouldn‚Äôt have gone after Lockie early in the over? Lol cause Warner was out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vijay Shankar is crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pep is the biggest fraud in football.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, let's send DK after Cummins and send Russell to open next game.  Idiots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beauty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ATintOfBlue @khamaniyo Hahahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Zizou philosophical as ever. Also this is me on Twitter after every Chelsea game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yikes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo I remember that hahahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyway, well played Dhawan and Delhi. Hopefully they go all the way!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Gotcha. Karn Sharma &gt; Jaddu would have been my pick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Lol here comes the revisionist history<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jadeja has Dhoni nudes? Only reason why he bowled that last over<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chahar despite doing well with the ball might be the reason why #CSK are staring defeat tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like #CSK didn't account for the dew.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now Jaddu will go for 45 in his 4 overs and CSK gonna get foooked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is Mark Nicholas drunk? Lol he spews such nonsense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I‚Äôm optimistic for Chelsea‚Äôs future. Not quite for Lampard‚Äôs future at Chelsea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a no-contest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stellar commitment to the brand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What message are you sending opposition teams when you go out and buy all the attacking talent and buy Silva as your center back? Come and attack us and there will be goals for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3-3. Hardly a surprise. Ziyech and all of Chelsea‚Äôs touches were awful. No one wanted to keep possession.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vintage CSK batting finish. Regard of outcome that was hella fun!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching Dhoni bat is painful. Hope he calls it quits and enjoys retirement.  None of this IPL crap is gonna undo what he did for India, not even remotely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3-2 Chelsea but need like another 5 to be safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yikes that was bad #cfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Faf really wanted to give that thigh five to Dhawan. Finally succeeded!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor shot from Watson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chelsea will always give you chances regardless of how many they are leading by.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor from Harvetz. Got muscled out there. Danny Ings in his form isn‚Äôt going to miss that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs the problem with Chelsea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Werner uff. That was Drogba like. Also jorginho. üî•üî•<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Messi-esque from Werner. Off the mark. üî•<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well done Kepa! Been an open game so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Axar against Watson. Yikes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CSK be like can‚Äôt afford to lose wickets against Nortje and Rabada, let‚Äôs give random noobie Tushar some love<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, Gurkeerat mann. Where do they get these players out of? üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyway, I guess this isn‚Äôt bad for CSK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Expect some stupid team like RR to pay crores in the next auction for Unadkat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Abd can dismantle bowlers like Bumrah, and RR feed Unadkat. Lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok RCB send ABD in every single time. Experiment with the rest of the players lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Despite Pickford and Richarlison‚Äôs efforts, Everton got a point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Milan, Napoli, Inter, Atalanta - some amazing teams in Serie A. This might. E the season Juve are stopped. (Lol)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow Napoli running riot against Atalanta.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you have Unadkat in your team, you should lose every game you set out to play.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unadkat over to win it for RCB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. What a resumption to league football after 2 weeks. Just like it was before the break!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Premier League is the most entertaining league in all of fucking sport. Wow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow wow wow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Horrible tackle. Straight red.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everton cannot win a game to save their lives against Liverpool. Their own doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Richarlison<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pathetic from Rocharlison.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pickford rave agent knocks out Van Dijk lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's more like Everton! This Liverpool were there for the taking before Van Dijk injury, now for sure!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's how you bait batsmen. Easy to blame Sanju here, but credit to Chahal again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Yeah yeah, it's early here :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every spinner should bowl without the fear of #Chahal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Expecting #EVELIV to be fully anti-climatic and be a dull draw. I hope not!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Crownish Yeah. It's sad. Google's messaging platform product teams work in silos and this is what end users are left with!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Siri: Which big tech company failed miserably at messaging platforms?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ESPN+ going places. As mentioned in the @profgalloway podcast, Disney is looking more and more dominant with its array of offerings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Friday morning commute sorted. Thank you guys! üôè<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Introducing the Green Premiums  https://t.co/d8JLwia5KH via @billgates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reece does this for Chelsea week in, week out, but no one to pounce on his inch perfect crosses. #CFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is the point of Uthappa? He can't bowl, very shit at batting, fielding, and now runs his teammate out. How does such a player keep getting games?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo I mean, of course, that should help #CSK too should they go on a good run :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stuff of dreams. Can't wait to listen to this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo I was thinking more like a top-2 team doesn't open up a big gap between themselves and the rest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rooting for #RR so table opens up. Game over now I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Butler did his job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bravo statpadding and he will play next game Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brava needs at least 18, so he can concede 15 and #CSK can win by 1 Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Lol, maybe not Kane but looks like the rest are enough!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Good call bro!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man Bravo is garbage. After all these years, how is he rated as a bowler? Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Chawla, at least spend one day at the gym man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Williamson is gonna win this for #SRH, isn't he?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vintage #Jaddu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#hispeed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Chahar's poor form continues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So much width for a new batsman. Poor from #Chahar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arvindv That's much better. Now it's game on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arvindv Not very confident in Chawla.  New ball pitch so I'm backing Warner and Bairstow to see them thru this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SRH favorites. Below par score with a below par bowling attack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good bowling from #Natarajan. #Dhoni did well, too. #CSK should be able to at least compete with this score. #IPL2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arvindv Exactly. Worked too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Confident that #CSK can stumble to 150. Two wide full tosses got #SRH wickets. Lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo @_danteswift True, makes for a nice retweet though. Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Idea batting from #CSK. Openers can't be dismissed if they don't take strike, except #Faf just got out first ball after being starved off strike. Anyway, at least they are willing to try something new. That's progress. #CSK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching today's IPL highlights. Kohli spends more energy celebrating than CSK players spend running between the wickets. #IPL2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bloodbath #Lakers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Notacrickethack By odd, I meant it was a shit innings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Nadal üôèüôè<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Odd innings from #Dhawan. Don't think it's enough. #IPL2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Iyer with a Virat-esque drive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a lot being made out of this top of the table clash. Frankly, it's a no-contest. #MumbaiIndians are miles ahead in form, squad depth, and man-to-man skill. #IPL2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was rooting for #SRH but #RR winning opens the table up a bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AND he swept the yorker specialist for a six, too. He put away two bowlers in form. Quality stuff. #IPL2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hitting #Cottrell on length in #Sharjah is one thing, but do it against the best bowler so far in #IPL2020 takes a different level of skill and courage. Well done, #Tewatia! #RajasthanRoyals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know, #MumbaiIndians were lacking in chasing scenarios this season so it's nice of #DelhiCapitals to play along.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DelhiCapitals won the toss and decided to give a win to #MumbaiIndians by batting first. Lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just give #Nadal the trophy and get on with it. Clay = #Nadal. This is as certain as death. #RolandGarros<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Tewatia did it again. #Tamil<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, Tewatia! That's some hitting. Packs a proper punch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tennis after eons! Hopefully, a good contest and #Nadal ends up winning. Miss you #Roger!  https://t.co/ZOeTGX7S2o<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rashid Khan is easily the best bowler in #IPL2020.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Natarajan's story was very moving. Hope he continues his fine start!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo @Chhokkwangun Lolll Uthappa has been awful lately<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a story! ‚ô•Ô∏è T Natarajan's long journey to IPL success  https://t.co/BUDRIeZYyk via @YouTube<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justinklosky @yashar You mean cancel?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CricketMedicine MI are clear favorites. Hope one of DC or RCB win it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CricketMedicine Yeah, would definitely take that! They look solid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope Dhoni hangs around in some capacity as a mentor/coach as his experience is invaluable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sport is a microcosm of life, where everything happens in cycles. Might be a few years before #CSK find their mojo again as this rebuilding or transition phase might enter a holding pattern but they will be back, I'm sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CSKian716 Amen. Just gotta write this season off and use it as a free hit to try fringe players like Rituraj and Jaggu.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well played @imVkohli. This #IPL2020 needed a Virat masterclass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rooting for anyone but #MumbaiIndians to win #IPL2020.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All good runs come to an end! If you told me in 2008 that #CSK would win a few titles and not make playoffs for the first time only in 2020, I'd have taken it! Time to acknowledge team failings, reflect, change and try again next season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyway, this happens in sport. Gotta take the learnings and move on! We might see a win or two when #CSK are mathematically out of the playoff race.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's hard to have that when you are not winning. These defeats have eroded #CSK's usual optimism. Been a strange season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm big into body language and I believe it tells a lot about a team's mood and intent. #CSK's has been missing in this entire tournament.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, a #Dhoni 6! Nice! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rayudu thinks he's Hayden walking down the pitch. Connected fuck all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Standing still is going backward. That's been #CSK for a few years now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Answer: after 12 overs. Very impressive from #CSK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First real intent and hustle in the running after 11 overs. Forget the pitch, you can at least try and run hard between the wickets. Did they not learn anything from #Kohli's innings?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apps like #Headspace and #Calm were developed with #CSK in mind. #WorldMentalHealthDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbennyman Yeah, I would love that. Given this CSK's think tank and player management, we will get some washed-up cricketer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CricCrazyNIKS Varun Chakravarthy too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy for all the #Tamizh boys kicking ass - Sundar, Natarajan, DK, Ashwin ;) #IPL2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And that's the game right there. Off to prepare lunch that I have been putting off. Well played, #Virat!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Run out watch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's see how quickly #CSK can make the RRR go up to 13-14. Good track record this season so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arvindv Yeah, ideally he should have quit in 2018. I love MSD but he looks spent and the team have had to constantly punch above their weight to compete. Need to maybe follow #MI player management strategy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arvindv Good point. Looks increasingly likely and I hope it is too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope #CSK doesn't somehow creep into the playoffs. This team needs a do-over and it will (?) come only if they finish bottom of the table.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>+ #Isuru offcutters will be a pain to put away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think #Chahal will use this pitch very well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>29 above par. #RCB's game to lose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You have #Kohli taking cricket fitness to a different level and then you have #Rohit with a paunch...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kohli could have killed Bravo there Lol!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyway, it's good that #Kohli is getting into form with #RCB looking increasingly likely to make playoffs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still think this is a 140-145 pitch. Kohli playing a blinder here helped by inept bowling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#RCB can declare here and win by 20 runs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>17th Over - Thakur with some shite.  18th so far - Drop and Kohli tearing into Curran.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shite fielding but that delivery deserved to go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kohli acknowledges Muthoot Finance after a good knock.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Massive wicket. Great comeback by #Thakur!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like these pitches are getting slower and slower as the tournament progresses. 150 will test #CSK here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get this kid an India jersey!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is Bravo rated as a bowler man? Like seriously, am I missing something here?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kohli looking good. Just hope we get to see a #KohliFace meme at the end of this game,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Padikkal has been awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yup, like I said below (along with probably every other cricket follower on this platform).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Yup, fair enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Yeah, I'm going to have to disagree with your view on that. I would have backed Maxwell to come good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bring one in to Finch, Chahar. He's a walking wicket. Lol. #CSK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo I'd have Maxwell's experience over a newbie any day. Even an out of form Maxwell is better than most. Can't put the young guy under that much pressure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would drop Russell next game. He jogs a few yards and then grimaces. Lol. Watson makes Russell look like Jonty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agarwal played the Rayudu shot today to get out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A KKR defeat would have opened the table up nicely. Not to be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Quite awful really. I don't know what goes through these guys' mind. CSK the other day with Jadhav, today you are holding back Maxwell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Credit to DK and KKR bowlers holding their nerve despite that baggage Andre Russell contributing zilch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely shocking from Punjab think tank.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mayank has been wonderful to watch. Clean hitting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice explanation by @irbishi disbanding KL Rahul's strike rate is overrated comment using an example.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Premier League may not need the pyramid but England and Southgate surely do | Jonathan Liew  https://t.co/DbXLqbW9zD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seeing clips of Shaheen Afridi's bowling doing the rounds on Twitter. Quality bowler!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the best innings in this IPL given the situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think KKR can defend 140 here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pathetic from Mujeeb on a helpful surface.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickeyrecricket Is there a stream for this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>dei CSK, at least beat RCB da.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy cow what a game of basketball! Lebron is GOAT but Butler, uff man! Take a bow!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ufff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a game!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Barring Lebron, Lakers have not turned up. Heat turning it up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Game 6 incoming I think<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gauravsabnis Gorgeous! I live in Michigan and traveling a few hours up north is totally worth it. The colors are stunning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pant reaching a high pitch that no other cricketer has managed while playing the game Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CSKian716 Ha! More power to you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CSKian716 Nice. I'm here all day for these.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Captaincy skills: Shreyas Iyer &gt; Rohit Sharma &gt; Virat Kohli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He gets him! No mankd though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ashwin vs Butler watch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo You know what, I think you have convinced me that my initial reaction was wrong, but in solidarity with Twitter, I'm doing to double down and defend my mistaken opinion :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every now and then Delhi have these games where they play the ground rather than the opposition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Fine. What about being aware of where the fielders are?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo 2 things:   - Pant should have waited for the call and not instinctively take off knowing the field. This was a 'wait on' more than a full 'Yes'. - At least glance where the ball went. Not complete ball watching, but a quick glance would have alerted him of the fielder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India had Dhoni, arguably the most street smart, composed cricketer India has ever produced...and now we have Pant. Talk about falling off a cliff!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pathetic from Pant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo @BeardedGenius @rizwanahmed True that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This guy's motivation to succeed has no limits. Amazing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@freehit_mj Lolll<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pence is BS-ing his way in this debate. His way to nowhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@freehit_mj Lol for real. He has said thanks to Kamala like a million times!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rooting for Delhi now. Fuck this stupid CSK side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lol. Even Gujarat Lions, Kerala Blasters and Pune Warriors were better than this CSK side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Waiting for Dhoni‚Äôs excuses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don‚Äôt deserve a medal for calling this as anybody could have called it. And in that lies the tragedy of this team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pitch has slowed. Need an anchor from Faf today. #CSK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#KKR clear favorites here. They have at least 20 runs above par. Not holding any high hopes from #CSK batting against #KKR bowling despite their last showing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndianMourinho Not crazy at all imo. He def should!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lol CSK getting all the big hitters out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was some horrid bowling from Chahar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bumrah today, Rabada yesterday, the best show their skills over time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Faf &gt; Pollard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seeing Pollard doing well pisses me off. Mumbai Indians remind me of United under Fergie. You hate em but deep down you know they are good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One six and the commentator goes RR still have a chance. Lol. Tired, boring commentary. Give me @KP24 every game please!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some games are over before even players take on the field. Despite RR's good record, I didn't have any hope for them coming into this game. #MIvsRR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This chase is done. I'd bowl all 8 from Boult and Bumrah straight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, even the likes of Rohit and Virat struggle against pulling Boult. Poor shot selection from Sanju.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With bowlers who lead their international attacks in most formats, Bumrah and Boult, your 170s are like 200+. Your 190s are 220-230. Only a #MI self-implosion on the day off can see them miss out on another title.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They make an error of sending Krunal in. Yet they have the talent to recover from it to post 193 without Pollard facing a delivery!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MI should be winning every game they set out to play. Yet they choose to keep competition in the game by delaying intro of Pollard and Hardik till the later overs. Strange decision making.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't catch, can't bat, can't bowl. #RR  look weak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OK, just catching up with the highlights of #PremierLeague. Holy mother! What a weekend. What a mental league. Predictability out the window!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CSK can go to hell lol. I'm all in for stories like these!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This #CSK team resembles #Barcelona against #BayernMunich when they got pummelled 8-2. You can't win a tournament from a strategy room but you can certainly lose it. #CSK's strategy has been awful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A perennial problem with Indian cricketers is not knowing when to step aside. This game calls for power hitters. #CSK don't have any.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely awful from Dhoni. Way, way past shelf life. I'm sorry.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Tweeting in between putting Trump in his place. Love it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>same<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's go Joe! #JoeBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gauravsabnis This is exactly what my work immigration attorney was telling me as they were filing my PERM. Crazy indeed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Customary #Alwayswatchbetis tweet. @tsf_podcast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ben Chilwell has a very low bar to beat in replacing Alonso. Hope he comes good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent from #Chelsea. Plenty of positives in the 2nd half! Loved the response.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This should have been the case for a while now, at least for 2-3 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good to see Dhoni maintain his sense of humor. And acknowledged his team's shortcomings. Let's see if he changes things for the next game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyway, a disappointing night for #CSK. Happens. Onward we go!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's an abject performance. Won't be the last of these kinds of defeats for #CSK, I'm afraid. #DelhiCapitals look good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CSK not helped by their spinners. Nowhere to hide for Jaddu and Chawla.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Nortje has been awesome. Good control.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyway, happy for #Ashwin and #DelhiCapitals. My pick for eventual winners.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Oh true, a good loss of only by 20 runs. What a lulz performance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CSK might eventually help RCB move up from their last spot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting fucked even from a NRR point of view. Serves CSK right for their showing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Faf's torment also ends.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I mean, Jadhav or Dhoni or Faf, these guys aren't gonna hit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wonder what excuses Dhoni will have today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How did a chase off 170+ come to 105 off 42?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Dhoni's logic of not batting early is because he hasn't played regular cricket, what business does he have even entering a cricket field? #CSK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Difference between Mishra and Chawla there. Mishra with immaculate lengths from ball 1. Chawla took 12 balls to get there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mishra's googlies are still fire.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Enna batting da idhu üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just start with 0/2 man. At least it gives the remaining batsman more deliveries to face.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mishra Ji stumping against at least 1 CSK batsman. Early call!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even before Axar wicket, Watson ---- you know what, I'm not going to finish this tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You don't even need to plan for this. Watson was a walking wicket against Axar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shreyas Iyer next (or future) India captain?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't believe I am typing this but well bowled #CSK toward the death. Too many for #CSK for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lolll Well bowled Hazelwood.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well bowled, Curran! Bowled to the field.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How big is this ground? #DC ran plenty of twos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With #CSK's bowling, if Dhoni offered 180 at the toss to the opposition without bowling a single ball, the opposition captain would always turn it down knowing that this is always a concede-200+ bowling and fielding unit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope he learns and moves on. The biggest aggression in that event was the dot ball, not flinging the ball at the batsman.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Curran with the most immature reaction of the IPL so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chawla finished well for the 2nd game in a row. But it takes him 2 overs to find the length to bowl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shaw playing well. Helping himself to some very ordinary bowling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dhawan feeling sorry for Chawla there. Lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CSK is the team you want to face as opposition when you want some form and momentum to your campaign. Even as fans, #CSK has become too predictable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every player can go for their 'top innings' against #CSK bowling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's good batting from Shaw but what can you do as a bowler. Chawla flights it and gets carted. Then bowls too short and gets thwacked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chawla's bowling like a man who went for 28 runs in an over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Haha thanks! I know Chahar is a very good new ball bowler but assumed Hazelwood was better given his ODI and Test exploits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Murali Vijay.....this level of fielding, batting. Could CSK not find anyone else?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Dang! Every day you learn!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shaw has been living a charmed life. Now he can go and make a hunna against this CSK bowling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Chahar is better than Hazelwood with the new ball? :|<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's the thought behind giving Chahar the first over when you have Hazelwood? #CSKvsDC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shaw with some fine drives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrettLee_58 @CricCrazyNIKS @ProfDeano @scottbstyris Thanks for sharing, Binga!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh God, let there be no more pain for us this year #RIPSPB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RIP Deano. Sad news. Knew him only as a commentator, especially during the India tour of Aus in 2003-04.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Barkley wtf. Torres levels of miss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great stuff from Chelsea. Good to see Havertz getting a couple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This, I can support. Not bullshit bills like AB5.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wut. Calling an unfit player unfit is wrong? What a daft tweet below.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a time we are living in. Surreal. Literally have goosebumps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo @movieamateur We will see!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#RR is one of those teams that's hard to hate. So, don't mind them winning today. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo I actually don't know. Only found out on CI during toss that he's not 100%.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always will be a loyal Dhoni fan, but no one is above criticism. I disagree with what he did in #WC19 semi-final and again tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the #CSK think-tank wanted to reduce the margin of defeat, then sure, they did that well. As fans, that's not gonna cut it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Zero blame on Gaikwad in this shitshow from #CSK. He gets a pass from me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>200 after 20 is a very flattering scoreline for #CSK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can buy that. The guy isn't getting any younger and his last game was over a year ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyway, credit to #RR. In all the analysis of the cosmic mystery that is #CSK's batting approach, #RR should be praised for their batting and bowling. Better team won!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Samson might have gone for a duck in his attempts early on but the intent man. Look at that intent!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sure, Ngidi went for a lot. Short ground and all that. But Vijay, Faf and Dhoni -- just not good enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you don't learn from your mistakes and act on it, you are regressing. #CSK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's an odd chase by #CSK. Very, very odd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jaddu completing with arc with leaving one outside off hahaha!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well played, Faf, despite the shit I was tweeting against him. Dhoni is playing the Ganguly role of latter years. Only contributes through captaincy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cue Ngidi last over makes the difference tweets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great ball from Curran!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dhoni switching strike first ball. Hit brother, hit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan I have no idea anymore hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too little too late.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RJ_Balaji Sema comedy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gotta give it to #TewatiaPayan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ability will only come out if the intent is there. No intent from CSK tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dhoni comes on. Lol bruh. Let's finish at 170 at least.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not Faf's day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What are you telling Jadeja, mate? haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Flemming: What the fuck guys?! #CSKvsRR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's just god awful from CSK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Faf is good if you are chasing 170-180 and one guy is going hammer and tongs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Swipe across the line if you have to Faf and Jadhav lol, no one needs to hold an end<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, fuck this, not in a pandemic year, I'm not going to let #CSK ruin my health. Again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CSK must have some internal D/L target in mind. Keeping it very discreet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watson and Vijay saw off the new ball. Faf and Jadhav playing for stumps. Yes, we all miss Test cricket too but come on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good bowling from Gopal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tewatia payan laam taking wickets. Podaang.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CSK still in lockdown mood.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what SHOULD have happened against MI. It didn't. It's happening now. I predict this to be a recurring theme for #CSK this year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dhoni's long rope spans across seasons Lol - Watson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hazelwood for Lungi ASAP. Vijay out when Rayudu returns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel sorry for Vijay. CSK somehow fluked their way to a win against MI but this could be a long, difficult season for them. No depth in batting. Weak bowling. Feeling very pessimistic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Dhoni comes next against Gopal, it will be a torment...for Dhoni.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vijay 21 off 20. There's your game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Told ya, Watson is hopeless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watson and Vijay, I'm sorry, shouldn't be anywhere near a T20 side. Way, way beyond expiry.,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CSK seeing off the new ball...chasing 217 in a T20 game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vijay's calling Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, Lungi has been awful in these first 2 games. Worrying for #CSK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KP24 spot on with what RR bowlers would have learned watching CSK bowl. Take the pace off and the game is yours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>186 off 19 itself was out of reach for #CSK. #Archer hit the nail on the coffin with 30(!) off the last over. No way in hell are #CSK getting anywhere near that with a bunch of slower balls coming from #RR.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pathetic bowling<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>WTF.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Delhi wooooo. Rabada get in!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Full toss on the pads hahahah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>hashahahahah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Catch the ball ye fools!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tough game for Chelsea but knew that was gonna be the case. Plenty of positives though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Werner looking good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lots of excitement surrounding Ashwin and he starts off brilliantly only to get injured and potentially miss out. Ye plan for something and something else happens. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just hope someone puts an arm around Kepa and makes him feel better. All this negativity must be difficult and can spiral into depression very quickly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh man, Ashwin! No! Hope it's not too bad; doesn't look good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ashwin you beauty! Lovely bowling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>30 runs! Uff!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What. An. Innings! Stoinis with some proper T20 batting. Delhi in with a chance now. Par on this wicket?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chelsea game time! Let's gooo! #KTBFFH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@knittins @RJ_Balaji I will pay for the beer to whoever tells me when Cheeka is on...so I can mute the TV!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We found Phosphine in Venus, yet Delhi are the same fuckin team every year. Lol! Pathetic batting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What have Delhi had before this game? Patience man!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never run from a misfield klaxon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that was a drop, but Shekhar Dhawan (Ganguly ref) Lulz!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As stated in the @theallinpod, it's a wealth transfer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The high line by #Southampton has been torn to shreds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üòç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Worst penalty in a long, long time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great memories.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fina-fucking-ly. A win against MI after eons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank god for review. "Take it forward:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This has been a great chase by #CSK. The usual lack of spine didn't rear its ugly head. Bumrah's off day helped a lot! Well played Faf, Rayudu, and Curran. Great toss to win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ü§°<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is dumb from CSK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rayudu playing a gem. Good for CSK in the tourney.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo True. Needs to happen soon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is only so much shelf line in these CSK players. Watson, Vijay etc., are done. Nothing left to squeeze out of these guys. They will give 1 good show in 5-6. Not enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, use your pads more. CSK bowlers did well to reduce the margin of defeat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watson getting out to inswing from Bolt. No prizes for calling that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyway, at least it wasn't a 200+ demoralizing fielding performance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm a glass half empty kind of guy, so this score feels like a missed opportunity for CSK. Should have been somewhere around 140-145. Basic ground fielding flopped. Good bowling overall though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It will be very typical of CSK to botch this chase up. Never easy with Bumrah and Boult but CSK have a habit of making a dog's meal out of chasing a modest score.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...and you have Faf at the other end of the spectrum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, big one! Difference between 180 and 165.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shit over from Curran. With Pollard around, 180-190 still on the cards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The OG #AlwaysWatchBetis? :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Leeds, turns out, learned their defending from #Fulham.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now, nothing easy about that. Reminds me of Sachin catching Inzy out in 2004 series.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>200+?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...he said while stuffing his face with rusk, lazing on a Sat morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Du Plessis with one of the easier relay catches. Done well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Fulham are shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's just pathetic bowling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meanwhile, Bielsa's Leeds are doing their thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Picked up the length so fast. Hardik is something else!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Typical Hardik<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes! 2 down woo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So nothing has changed for CSK Lolll<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chahar is swinging it but he's getting carted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ba dum tish :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rohit uff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kbalakumar Sema comedy hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CSK starting as underdogs against MI. On paper, it's a no-contest as MI have had the edge over CSK for a while now. Having said that, CSK winning and bowling first gives them their best chance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No other Indian player generates the level of excitement as Dhoni simply by being on screen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh MS, how we missed you. The humor is sharp as always. ‚ô•Ô∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hype! Hype! Can't wait to see the Indian boys back in action!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't get enough of @MelissaReddy_ 's analysis, tweets, opinions. Enjoyed the Poch interview on her #BehindTheLines podcast.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Fair enough! Many people are sick of CSK and MI winning. Hope Delhi or RCB pull it off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abbygov they missed out on amazing idli sambar by becoming extinct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Haha! As a CSK fan, I can see why the hate toward CSK is a thing :P. Is your team Delhi?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo üëÄ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RorySmith The usually dreaded corner flag photo used for a good story. Nice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Despite Mumbai's success, I'd go for Dhoni but not by much. Mumbai's superior squad management helps Rohit a lot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well bloody done, Australia. What. A. Chase! Did not see that coming!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what Australia of years gone by would routinely do to other teams. Seemingly down and out, they'd find an inner resolve to make unbelievable comebacks. England did just that today. Well done!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Defense, defense, defense. Story of Chelsea's frailties<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alifiyatahir @brfootball Awesome! If I ever come by Jersey, would love to meet you and your husband!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always ran that risk. committed bodies up front. good from Chelsea, very good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahhhh fuckk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alifiyatahir @brfootball Excellent! :) In Jersey?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pulisic u american legend!! get in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>omgggg should have been 3. Chelsea throwing everything in now, why not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If only we had a semblance of a defense this season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is what Pulisic brings to the team. Gonna be immense next year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just as I feared, Liverpool used up their mistakes against Arsenal and Chelsea playing them back into form (?).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alonso defending hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a ball uff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alifiyatahir @brfootball Thanks, Alifiya! How you doin in general? Everything good?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chelsea's game management has been awful all season. When you go a goal down, manage the following minutes well. Same when they are ahead, need a leader-type figure like JT or Van Dijk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chelsea have found a way to concede goals in all manner of ways. 52 goals conceded. How are we still in contention for top 4 going into the last game? lol #cfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wijnaldum should have had 2 himself. Bad defending. Oh well, on to the next game. Confident of Leicester losing and/or Chelsea taking a point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Missing Pulisic. He would have done better to keep Trent a little back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oilysailor Loll<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alifiyatahir @brfootball Hello :) Yeah, Alifiya. Moving back to Michigan with an offer in hand. Such relief!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kepa is suspect again. Chelsea have been good this game but 2 mistakes: one from William and another from referee see them 2-0 down. Shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How's that a foul? lol #kovacic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alonso as an LB is a myth. Yesterday's formation brings out the best in him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a performance by Chelsea! Outplayed United in every department. Hats off to the #blues!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pool game might have been a fluke in the way they scored their goals but the common theme is the steel in defense that Arsenal seems to have built.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow Arsenal! Impressive!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BumbleCricket The little adjusting of the helmet after. Proper cricketer in the making!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CricketMedicine Have milk by the side!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Zapata's hold up play is amazing. Reminds me of Drogba. #Atalanta #SerieA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Haha dangg, such a popular movie. Heath Ledger, uff, what a performance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo One of the greatest superhero movies ever. I went to the theaters six times to watch it with different sets of friends haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's 2020 and this guy still goes on this angle.  Very tiring.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pizzapurist Maybe he/she forwarded the heart from a previous time in the same conversation? haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamWhyte Lots of love, Sam. If there ever was a way to go, your dad knew it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not holding any hopes for #CrystalPalace to take points from #United. #cfc have to do it themselves by beating #Liverpool and #Wolves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Sheffield have been very poor today. Much to my dismay as a #Chelsea fan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pep had Messi, Iniesta, Xavi at Barca; one of the strongest Bayern teams in decades; then comes to City. Yes, the freshness he brings to the game is great, but developing a squad like what's Klopp doing now, Fergie and Mou did in the past? Can't say Pep's had that challenge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CricAussieFan See his follow-up tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Club legend in no time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The level of bait in this is extraordinary. How many teams can you have a go at through a single tweet record broken üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank God! That miss by Woodd was awful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCSportsSoccer @NBCSports Horrible crowd noise control in the Burnley vs Wolves game. Please do better or turn it off completely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How do you miss that Lol?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Wolves have played like a million games this season yet their fitness levels are insane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I mean, yeah Burnley defended very well, but had nothing to offer going forward. Wolves were doing all the attacking so far. Sucks from Chelsea pov, but saw it coming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh god no! Smaller teams might as well pack their bags and not even try against the likes of City, Liverpool etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beats me really. Should not be anywhere close to the top 4. #cfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chelsea cling on after a forgettable game. #cfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I understand Alonso's preferred foot is his left but the guy never, NEVER, even touches the ball with his right. It's such a limitation having a player like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pukki to score. With zero shots anywhere near Chelsea's goal, I sense Norwich are gonna score.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty awful from Chelsea, what was Zouma doing there? If Chelsea manages to win today, it'll most likely the last win of the league, possibly the last points acquired as well. #cfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Giroud's first clean connection of the day and a goal. Nice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The way Chelsea have started, you'd think they have given up on 4th spot already. Very, very slow in moving the ball against a relegated side. Dull. #CFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe, it's because of me switching off Saints scored. I'll take that. #Chelsea somehow still in 3rd. God, what a race for top 4!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My streak for getting predictions wrong continues. #Saints were outstanding in the 2nd half, #Hasenhuttle has changed this side since the 9-0 drubbing. Also, I'm an idiot for turning away after 90 mins of intense football.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>de Gea with a worldie save!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very impressive from United. Won't be enough to challenge a revitalized City next year though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Southampton are playing such a high line against a team that relies on getting you on the counter. This could be 4 or 5 for United by the time it ends.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Southampton defending like Leicester in the last 20 mins yesterday. Awful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>City ban overturned. Hardly a surprise. UEFA loses more credibility by the day. Super League will happen within the next 5-7 years. #mcfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Almost chelsea level defensive collapse :\<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Little more composure and Bournmouth could have had 5-6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg what a miss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SOLANKEEEEE hahahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Leicester have to play Sheffield, Spurs and United. One can dream. Chelsea have Norwich, Pool, Wolves. #cfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HOLY COW Bournemouth hahah love this league<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Lolll truee!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All praise the lord!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, this game! Bournemouth have been good this half but this is insane!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking forward to next season, I don't see any squad or manager that can challenge Liverpool &amp; City. The title will continue to change hands between these teams for the next 3-4 years at least.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hoping for a Danny Ings special tomorrow. ü§ó<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hoping for #Bournemouth to do some damage today lasted longer than I expected. #cfc #CAS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>West Indies winning is always fun, sometimes even against India. This win coming against England and in England in a topsy turvy chaotic world is sure to lift a lot of people's moods. Jason Holder is a proper leader! #ENGvWI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amazing win from West Indies. Brilliant return to cricket! #ENGvWI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pablo Hernandez you legend!! #LeedsUnited<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>C'mon Windies, you got this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a return to Test cricket. Almost worth the break. God, I love Test cricket! #ENGvWI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fair enough. Chelsea have no business fighting for top 4 given the ban and Lampard's managerial experience. Exciting times ahead for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not having CL might not attract the best talent for next season but it might be blessing for Chelsea. Maybe, just maybe it could help them focus on building a system, starting with defense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the PL started in 2 hours, then all teams would be on 0 points.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even CAS can't help Chelsea enter CL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Lazio and #Inter have fallen spectacularly since the restart. Rooting for #Atalanta to win today and possible push #Juve close.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Feel bad for the guy. He's looked out of depth ever since his move to PL. Price tag definitely not helping his case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Center backs and GK don't seem to have any communication between them. #CFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Praying for this Loll but knowing FFP, it pretty much won't happen. City are too big to annoy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't say this was completely unexpected from Sheffield. Out of 12 points available before the start of this game, I had Chelsea getting 4. Draw v Sheffield, defeats against Wolves and Liverpool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good use of VAR there. #RealMadridAlaves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>United are rampant now. Martial wants one too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess that's it for Aston Villa. Unlucky with the first goal, shite for the second goal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You give Greenwood that much space, he's gonna bury you in current form.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel for the players at the receiving end of shitty usage of VAR. The implementation curve of VAR is proving to be very steep. Much more refinement required.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jon Moss is hopeless as a referee.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a joke of a decision. How is that a penalty?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Powerful from Michael Holding! #BLM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saka is a joy to watch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyhoo, 3 points in the bag. Rooting for Arsenal now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chelsea's defense miraculously survived that onslaught (?) from Palace. Woeful showing, no clue how we got the 3 points.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kepa is a weakness in this Chelsea side. More goals in this one for Palace, I feel. Chelsea need at least 2 more to be safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a game by Southampton! Great effort!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Currently in San Jose. It's goin off!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good response from Chelsea so far after the shitshow against West Ham. Pulisic consistently good since return.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't read much into the game other than what we already knew. City are a hella good side, so are Liverpool. Hopefully a closer race between these two next season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>de Bruyne is out of this world. Crazy good!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a miracle Chelsea have managed to come this far with their defense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chelsea are yet to play Liverpool and Wolves, both of which can destroy this Chelsea defense. Need United to start dropping points and Leicester to continue dropping points.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Abysmal performance by Chelsea. United favorite to finish above Chelsea now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klopp, Guardiola, Zidane will continue to define 2020s. Lampard and Arteta have what it takes to grow in similar capacity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Couldn't be happier for Klopp. Great guy leading a great team! Enjoy Liverpool fans!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lampard has been amazing in Chelsea so far. Very good debut season. Looking forward to the remaining 7 games and the next season already!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congratulations, Liverpool! Also, what a performance by Chelsea. Brilliant!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Literally have no clue who are favorites in #ElClasico Both have been extremely mediocre.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Clear and obvious is in itself ambiguous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyway, the race to 4th (or 5th) takes another stumble, but onward we go! #CFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>VAR distracts from Chelsea's real issues - of a weak, young side, disjointed side slapped together. I didn't expect the Jan window to solve the issues but the fact we barely tried to is worrying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>fair, that's offside, but that movement from giroud was awesome. Michy was slow as fuck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>lampard, please play giroud. i just don't understand why he didn't<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now that the ban has been lifted and with Ziyech incoming, we can hope for an improved performance next season. Just performance, not necessary league position.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Before the season started, i predicted Chelsea to comfortably finish outside the top 4. Then lamps gave this team some hope. I think in the past 14 games, things have evened out a bit and this is a more true reflection of this Chelsea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#neverforget<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Weak team on paper, didn't play like it, 2 poor refereeing decisions went against Chelsea. Definitely a poor performance with or without the refs influence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah should have seen red, but that's pathetic defending<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>fuck off lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is there a way to see how refs are faring over a period of time? Taylor's performance today should surely dock him some points<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>lol football eh. what a joke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Batshuayi...come on man. no wonder Lampard has relegated him to an afterthought<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>how is tht not a red? lol, the guy moved his leg to kick Mitchy in the balls<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>...and Rahul switch hits the last ball for 6. 14 off the over. Incredible shot. KP woulda been proud!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Atherton not missing an opportunity to bat for 5-day cricket. I mean Kohli has said he‚Äôs not a fan, so it was never going to happen. This Test is another nail in that idea‚Äôs coffin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sibley MOM. Ben Stokes very important with bat and ball as usual. Philander might regret not taking that single to keep strike but that‚Äôs not where the game was lost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, #Butler calling an opponent a "fucking knobhead" is OK is it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2019 was #BenStokes' year. 2020 off to a good start for him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>No way #Australia are going to attempt to win this. I'll be surprised if they manage to play out 48 overs and salvage a draw! #Ashes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well played, Stokes! A changed cricketer. Going places now. Happy for him! #Stokes #Ashes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope #Smith recovers fast. Every day he's not playing is a loss for cricket. Good of Australia to apply the concussion protocol rigorously. Health above sports. #Ashes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The law was applied correctly. Blame the law change, not VAR. Also, City have only themselves to blame not getting 3 points from this game. Great Escape by Spurs.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What an effort by Australia! I knew Smith would hang around but the team played around him superbly. Great stuff!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wade pulled it right into that fielder's hands. Well played, though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pant again with a daft shot, but this one's better than yesterday's.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sampras's record stood for what seemed like ages. Along came Roger scaling mountain Everest itself. Nadal was like wait a min, I'm here too. Novak is like you both can have the rivalry and all that, let me do my thing. Really blessed to have these 3 greats play in the same era.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In all the Federer love, what Novak has achieved is nothing short of remarkable. He's only 32. By the time he retires, he'll surely go past Roger's record. Nadal might too. What a truly insane men's tennis era!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You have delivered more than any fan of the game could have asked for. You were brilliant!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Roger says he feels like it's an opportunity missed. It sure does. Lesser performance than today have won him big games in the past. Sometimes, even being better than your opponent isn't enough to win games. Need that luck with you, too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jimmy, you were great! Be proud!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Wow, must have been some performance! I read his pieces when he used to write to Cricinfo; seemed like a passionate chap and obviously revered!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo That's sad. Martin Crowe was before my time. He was captain then yeah? Why did he miss the semi?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is a strong possibility that this crop of NZ players might not make it to another final. That's the way it goes. A lesser skilled NZ team might come along, play out of their skin tournament cricket and win a WC and we will be left wondering how!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Dang! Been a while! Glad we got this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Haha yeah! Don't think any of the other finals from 96 to 2015 can even be classified as competitive. :\ Literally we went from zero to hundred with this final!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Happy for Eoin Morgan. He led HIS team superbly, in the field, and importantly, with the bat, too. He was also blessed with a great crop of players who delivered when he went to them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@knittins Recency bias! :) In my opinion, Aus-SA was the greatest. 20 years, the replays still hurt. Was way more invested in SA on that day than NZ today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo True! Haha :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time for a break from sports watching till the PL returns. Need to refresh!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Yeah, kinda obvious, true, but I find that amazing that these guys don't let their focus spill on to useless shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All these accomplished sports personalities only seem to care about the process and the 'immediate future'. Their focus goes as far as the next point. Bet Novak didn't think like 'Oh no, I am facing 2 match points against Roger, &lt;insert achievements&gt;'. That takes mental strength!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Roger didn't show much emotion during the press conference. He managed to smile and even cracked a joke. I am sure this is hurting him but he gives me the vibe of someone who's just happy he's competing at 37. Takes defeat in his stride well - definitely better than his fans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nooo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo @EyeOnThePitch Ahhhh, niceee!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This whole deserved vs not deserved is the most tired reaction to a sporting outcome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EyeOnThePitch Absolutely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>- Boult's catch against WI - Boutl's non-catch today - Roger serving with 2 championship points - Guptill's run-out against India  Sports really is the closest metaphor to life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyway, enjoyable day of sports despite not getting desired results in the WC or Wimbledon. The disappointments peak faster than they used to but they also dissipate at the same rate. Strip all drama down &amp; it's just a game. Congrats to England and Novak! Thanks NZ and Roger! ‚ù§Ô∏è<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Cricket has only widened the gap between itself the sport below it, in England. It hasn't closed the gap between itself and Football, which is light years ahead in first position.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One thing is certain, whether it's because I've seen everything in life, in sports or just purely because of ageing, the disappointments of defeat peak fast and they come down very fast too. It doesn't linger as much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sports is cruel, yet rewarding when things go your way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The racists would have been out in force again. Writing pieces about cultural integration and bullshit like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kane is all class. Lots to learn from him, his composure in a time like this. Sports myriad teaching moments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All luck for England today. Regardless, congrats England. Congrats Archer! The racists tried to keep you out, no one can.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New Zealand I love you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guptil? Really?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So England are winning and Federer lost. Save my Sunday!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Novak best Roger and the crowd. Well played man!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuckin shit over from Boult<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love you Roger! Thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meanwhile Roger deiiiiiii<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I cannot tuppeppe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hdhdidjndndjjfjjdidijs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Faaakshshdjdjdjdjdjdijdjrjrjrjrj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck mannn now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus Christ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Toooo manyyyyyy emotions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't need to workout today. Absolutely destroyed today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Latham ummahhhh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2 match points saved. Stuff of Netflix documentaries. Novak has cojones. I might cry again. 11 years on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to cry again. 11 years on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yessssssssssss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>11 years from THAT final. We are witnessing another epic. Did not see this coming. Every point from Roger has been a bonus in the past few years. Outcome, in the macro sense, is immaterial.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This tennis is insane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What. A. Hold. Fuckin A!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EyeOnThePitch Hahaha! I can't keep up with both these games. I'm losing it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yessssss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too many errors man. Oh well, thanks for the fun Roger!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wheels coming off the backhand game for Roger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was coming. Roger broken in the fifth set.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too many unforced errors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Roger tiring.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is England's to lose once again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Need that wicket. Come on Kiwis!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a rescue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Backhand klaxxon!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Roger getting into the idgaf mode. This could be over soon for him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yesss Roger, yessss! Into the fifth. What a contest! Proper throwback!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Roger giving me heartache too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on you Kiwis, you got this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That rally....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Novak didn't throw that set. Roger fucking snatched it from him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meanwhile Roger is making me lose all sense of time and (my typing skills). Time is indeed a flat circle!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm losing my typing ability. You know what that means to this game. Kiwis on fiyahhhhhh. Come onnnnn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a fuck info catch uesssssss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's out mannnnn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A break isn't a break until it's hold!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Roger breaks come on!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Successful Roger challenge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tough for Roger and Kiwis. Both fighting hard. Love it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gupta ji warming up for a run out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on kiwis come on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sdayanand Wanna RT. üòá<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on kiwis, please<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck yeah lockiieeee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Roger losing tiebreaks in which he seemingly is playing the better tennis. Novak, beast mode well and truly on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Novak was like fuck the second set, I'll try in the third. The guy knows his game well üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on kiwis keep chipping away<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Truer words haven't been said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a fucking point!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, this is WC final winning level of luck for England. Let's go home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on man Kiwis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two gripping games. Kiwis and Roger!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally, phew!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Roy has 2 modes today: play and miss OR lovely drives for 4.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, that was a surprise. Expecting Novak to come here again in the third but I'll take this set. Phew.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Novak pulled a Roger here in throwing away an entire set.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Couple of super shots from Bairstow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never trust Novak when he goes into this lull, the guy's a monster!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NZ would have had India 5-3 or something with this bowling...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>England getting the luck needed in big games going their way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eshers Love it!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on Kiwis, Roy's here for the taking!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good start by Roger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fucking umpire's call bullshit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck man, that was out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had good chances at 5-3 but couldn't capitalize. Oh well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This could unravel very quickly for Roger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck. He needed that first set. Uphill now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn man, after 4 in a row for Roger, it's looking tough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>England 50-5 coming up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck man he's losing this set isn't he<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wtf Roger howwww<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a clutch shot Roger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mental from Roger wow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe this time Santner's armball will get him a wicket in the first over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sidvee Ooo off by 1!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>England's game to lose. #CWC19Final<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Serve and volley baby!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What sort of shitty algorithm does Twitter use for my timeline!? Bullshit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh no Roger!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was a suffocating innings from CdG.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a shot, Roger!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab Same haha :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Microsoft Teams overtakes Slack with 13 million daily users  https://t.co/6UmnOnqGEo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Or is #Novak gonna eat more grass? #Wimbledon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright, Roger, you've thrown back the clock already. One more time, please! #Roger #Wimbledon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>England are gonna win World Cup and Ashes in the same year? Lord save us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sidvee 240<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pathetic from Neesham. Really woeful. 250 looks more and more distant now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plunkett again but what a shot man, thu!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like it might finally come home for England. Loool!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>98 off 90 to get to 250. 6 wickets in hand. Tough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Give more reviews man. Help the umps, players, fans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ooooh, height?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dharmasena wrongly giving out Kane Williamson and there's no review left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rashid bowling beautifully.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wimbledon in another hour and cricket will take a backseat for me. One more, #Roger, just one more! #Wimbledon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plunkett again! What a man!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Williamson gone, yuuuuuuge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heard the nick real-time on my TV. That's out I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whatever score Kiwis post, winning or losing comes down to how soon they can get Roy out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shot, Kane!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Couldn't have said it better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NZ looking good here. On course for 250, at least.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>England losing the plot, Kiwis on course for 350...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is pathetic, really. If the idea of an 'atmosphere' doesn't suit your definition of a cricketing 'atmosphere', then let's bash it. There's more than one way to enjoy a game of cricket.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NZ should take the batting innings as deep as possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No throwing beer up in the air celebration?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woakes has been brilliant this tournament. Guptill was a sitting duck against the fuller ball.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Williamson playing nightwatchman role here. The openers saw of 6.2 OVERS, man! Wow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was a dumb review.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dharmasena on point here!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's the first one. 6.2 overs and they looked edgy and hung around. Guptill gone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2 correct decisions made in the game so far. 1 through umpire, 1 through technology. So far so good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shot Guptaji!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a review!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab So stupid really. They have a narrative in their head and will ask any questions to suit that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something tells me #NZ are gonna lose this in the first hour. I see something like 40-3 after 15 situation happening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't believe the #CWC19 is coming to an end already. Lots of fun, hope another of the same! I had India in finals but oh well, that's the way it goes! Seeing the anthems play out and India not being there hurts, it's true. Great tournament regardless!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>England are overwhelming favorites that NZ are being written off here. Much like against #India, NZ are more than capable of surprises. Hope they pull off one tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good toss to win for #NZ. Batting first makes sense as it suits their strength. Get to 250 (Min) and we have a game on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dilippoduval Looks like the pitch might grip a little üòÇüòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cricketcouch I may be wrong but Jonty was probably the first one to make excellent fielding ke that consistent and importantly, looked hella cool doing that. I don't think anyone else in that era was as agile as him. Would have scaled some serious numbers in Sridhar's fielding metrics.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>On paper, England are definitely the better balanced side and hence, favorites. Either way, it's a much needed breath of fresh air for cricket that we will have a new champion for the first time since '96. Preferably, Kiwis, since they are outside of the 'Top 3'. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kane and Taylor as NZ's batting backbone superbly supported by their reliable crop of fast bowlers. England's Bairstow-Roy partnership at the top, their firing middle and lower order and their fast bowlers have been very reliable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Both New Zealand and England deserve their spot in tomorrow's final. Whoever wins will deserve it too, because of their clarity in style, selection and process in the past 4 years. They both had a blueprint to their success and stuck to it without wavering much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Simon Halep, take an almighty bow! What a performance!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Halep's defense uffff man. How!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dilippoduval hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I didn't watch the Roger win yesterday but if it was anything like Halep's performance today then I am definitely rewatching the match. Halep on fire here!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a winner!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab Enjoy! :) Halep on fire!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Never trust a newspaper that claims a higher moral ground than you're at. Blatantly false reporting regarding Kohli's comments when Kohli's presser was broadcast to the world. And they ask for donations so this can continue? No thanks! @guardian<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Janab_e_Ali @Nabeel_Chohan ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èSorry your board isn't capable of anything :) In summary, here's my advice, get your house in order first. Win more. Make yourself eligible for banter in the first place, then tweet at me. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan @Janab_e_Ali Besides, if anything, you guys were the ones whining about formats and luck and such!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan @Janab_e_Ali Please do me a favor both of you. I am even dropping a link here. Let's not misconstrue what's said to suit narratives. Too much of that going on already!   https://t.co/gEFyHwfOQz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan @Janab_e_Ali He didn't ask for a format change you guys :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Janab_e_Ali @Nabeel_Chohan I know this might come up. Guardian misquoted him. Do me a favor and listen to the question posed to him and his response and then come back to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan @Danny61000 @Janab_e_Ali 2009 and 2017, right? T20 WC and 2017 CT trophy right? Genuinely don't recall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Michael Vaughn was right. Beat India and you have a chance to win the cup!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, a new WC winner. Long overdue! SL was the last one?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan @Danny61000 @Janab_e_Ali You can keep moving the goalpost all you want. India consistently reaches knockouts, common sense will tell you that a trophy is around the corner. :) But that's too much to expect from fans whose sporting discourse is why did this guy yawn, why did this guy have burger!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In 2011, the host country, India, were favorites and went on to win the WC. I don't think Australia were favorites in 2015. England are favorites for this WC and they could replicate what India did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan @Janab_e_Ali You guys have to reach knockouts consistently to even lose in the knockouts! :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Janab_e_Ali @Nabeel_Chohan Yes, let's give the world cup to you guys. üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate England but this is some serious batting. 4 years in the making and coming clutch in WC semis. Very entertaining!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If that's a hamstring strain, then Baristow should go back and ready himself for the final (if). England have enough batting to win it from here. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Roy's body language after hitting a six is like Sehwag's. Almost like 'Yeah, I hit you there, so?'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan @Janab_e_Ali Guys, tell me more about how NZ didn't deserve to reach the semis/finals and that Pakistan should have been there. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wish India had played Pakistan in semis, we would be celebrating another final appearance now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbennyman Can't beat some gooooo fried chicken! I miss Virginia!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dilippoduval What an idiot. Lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dilippoduval What's the context here?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is this guy on about? I am legit confused!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brilliant!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor man's Dani Alves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Years ago, reaching semis of an ICC event was a huuuge deal. In the past 5 years, India's earliest exit from such tournaments have been semis. Yes, we need to get better at knockout cricket, and we WILL get there, but for now, this consistency is nothing to be scoffed at.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jazz_CB West Indies in the US of A. Hype! (Jk)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As much as I hate England, I would prefer a new World Cup winner. Hopefully Kiwis but England as worst case scenario. If Australia win again, fuck me, a part of me will die.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on @BCCI, how about a cheeky 3-ODI series against SL, eh? Eh?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Being overly dramatic aside, I felt better immediately after the game than hours later. Bleh. Need this world cup to end like now and India's next assignment to start like tomorrow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright, my way to tackle India loss today: Worked out, made some nice chicken curry to have with paratha and.. and....noooooo I can't do this *sobs uncontrollably*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo @CricketMedicine Haha alright, that's like 3 times you got me today. cut a man some slack on a tough day :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sdayanand @dilippoduval For real. I have moved on from dissing his sometimes nonsense commentary but of course, let's keep bashing him till end of time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo @CricketMedicine Bruh, that is hindsight! :P I get your point though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sdayanand @dilippoduval Also, I didn't think his tweet praising Jaddu was derogatory or making fun, I read that as 'OK, you proved me wrong, well done!'. Same goes for the clip where he calls himself out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CricketMedicine Yeah, maybe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda - India came into the WC with middle order problems, we masked that as much as we could, but the band-aid could hold no longer and we lost. There are lessons learned and lessons applied. Hopefully, we learn and apply our lessons soon. #TeamIndia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo @EyeOnThePitch @HomerOpines A whole bunch of idiots who have nothing better to do really. That presser was handled very professionally. Dunno what more they want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BCCI , WC needs to happen every year if India doesn't win it. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just when I thought I need a long break from sports, the PL starts in less than a month!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Oh yeah, fair! Chawla hahaha did absolutely fuck all long with Sreesanth; can''t believe Sreesanth was in that squad Loool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab Ohhh yeahh yeahh haha :) Woulda been nice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Loool got carried away. ALl images of 2011 wc for me is yuvi bailing us out time and again. Forget how important Zak was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab Blahhhh. It's OK. We will win a trophy soon enough!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab An England win tomorrow and a loss to NZ will be ideal!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Yeah, absolutely. I agree. :) These stories are more enjoyable when your team wins haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man how clutch was Yuvi in 2011. Single handedly won us the cup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Same. But my point was that following sports only for the wins becomes dull after a point. Regardless of outcome, we should look for stories and enjoy them. I dunno if it makes sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Undeserving New Zealand first sneak into semis, now the same lot sneak into the final. Oh the injustice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is exactly how I feel. Maybe I am FINALLY growing up too...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India doesn't need wholesale changes for the next major event. Just that we have to trust the players we are grooming for the big event and not make knee jerk selection switches. For instance, if Pant is your No. 4, give him games, then when event comes along, play him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If sport were only about winning, then it'd be boring.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bagrat15 Yeah, that's the one. :) Does feel like ages ago haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My biggest strength and weakness. Go back to it every single time in hope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bagrat15 Champions Trophy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India's last major trophy was in 2013. Feels like a lifetime ago, amplified by making it to the latter stages of 2015, 2017 and 2019 tournaments. The expectation bar has been raised and performances have matched that. Only a matter of time before the next trophy arrives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay Roger. This day gets better!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imVkohli It's all good man. We will be here for the next game! Good effort!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan No ones denying Dhoni has lost a lo of sharpness in batting with age, but this approach was right, IMO. To make a 15% chance of success to 30-35%. We wouldn't be talking about it had he not taken this approach.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan There was no other approach man. We wouldn't be 92-6 if everyone could come and go from the get go Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan Dhoni against Afghanistan was very slow. Against WI, it proved right. Today, it didn't work but this is a calculated approach given the resources at hand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan What if the person (Dhoni) batting at one end has this method tried and tested multiple times with success? What then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan Let me engage, Jadeja is hitting the ball very cleanly. Dhoni is farming the strike well, trying to take the game deep with Neesham bowling the last over. Keep in mind that it's is by no means a batting wicket. After you is Bhuvaneshwar. What do u think is the right approach?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan This is just my opinion. It's not a fact. I see you chose to disagree and that's OK. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan Lol, it's OK. You are just another tweet on my TL. I dunno what match ya'll were watching.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eshers This is fucked up news. this day needs to improve fast.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had more confidence in this team delivering the WC than the one that did in 2011. As Drake says, you know how that shit go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slicesofIife Maybe but these players will play at least 1 more WC. And there is a good crop of players in the pipeline. We can be confident of tournament success very soon tbh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, this montage is making me feel like shit. #hotstar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slicesofIife Chin up bro, I share your hurt but we had a good tournament.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Fine, goal-line clearance trailing 2-1, had the goal gone in, the trailing team had 1 min to make it 2-3. There! :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NZ lost 3 games in a row, under big pressure, they batted first in a semi and scrapped to 240 -- that's like their bread and butter scenario to bounce back and bounce back they did, massive respect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kohli speaking maturely about Pant, as we have grown accustomed to. Quality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This format is pretty good, but there is a genuine case to have an IPL style playoff, where the top team gets 2 chances.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want England to win tomorrow, have a road in the final and get fucked by NZ....on the damn road. Would love nothing more! #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Yeah, then we two are agreeing man, this is peak twitter conversations :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Australia series win was on par with the 2011 WC victory. Even a WC win here could not have topped the away series win in Australia. Need to focus on winning a series in SA, England.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This cannot be emphasized enough. We have the perfect system in place for continued success, across formats. More of the same and the trophies will follow. See, 2011 WC, Australia series win earlier this year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo At 92-6, nobody expected that fight from Jaddu, right? Unlikely shit happens, but Guptill killed whatever little chance India had. That's my point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every tweet I come across has a coulda, shoulda, woulda to it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo I got the joke bro. That six off Ferguson and Neesham bowling the last over is why I am saying India could have gotten that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dhoni is Indian cricket. No farewells required.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Ahh, the classic labelling and typecasting someone to a group :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo I disagree!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guptill's run out was clutch. That's the soccer equivalent of a last minute goal-line clearance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Janab_e_Ali @Nabeel_Chohan Yeah, no shit haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, Kane, we love you and are right behind you. In fact, I can say the entire subcontinent is with you! haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan I don't think it's Dhoni's fault tbh, easy to put the blame on him. NZ were better yaar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know we have to look inward first and all that bullshit, but credit to NZ. They were better on the day. In batting, bowling and fielding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab Right back at you! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks, MS! Great career.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks #TeamIndia . You guys were amazing and made us hella proud. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go on, Kane, win it all now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aha_irshi Damn!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's how you win games man. Fuckin A, what a throw! Well played, MS, Jaddu. Loved the fight!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why NZ should be in the final.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boult uff man. Cojones!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>23.3M and that should be the game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amazing innings man! Brilliant!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well done, Jaddu!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>22.8M<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>22.6M<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uff boult!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jaddu, hit straight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>22.5M<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>great over, well bowed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>22.4M<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was 4 there over third man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>21.9M.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>21.6M.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>21.2M as jaddu takes in fluids.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1 for Boult, 1 for Ferguson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>20.5M. Sorry I am going mad. This seems to help India perform well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>20.1M as Jaddu nicks for 4.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>100 partnership. Take a bow you beauties.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>19.9M<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>19.8M<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Didn't think this match could even reach a level where it could give me heartbreaks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>19.5M<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dhoni shake hands loading....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>19.1M<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>18.8M<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jaddu, I will create a religion for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't take another CSK heartbreak this year man!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>18.7M<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>18.1M<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am suddenly superstitious. I will pee in a cup if I need to but I ain't moving!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TestingRhymes True!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>17.6M<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>17.3M<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>17.2M on US Hotstar. Hope the servers hold!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good fight, India. However this game goes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lots of coulda, shoulda, woulda thoughts going on in my head right now. LMAO. Cricket eh!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like Jaddu wants that Man of the Match conversation with Manjrekar :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jadeja has done enough to be in this side on a regular basis. Played man. Love a good fight!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>90 off 60. Ok, Ok. I see what you are doing there, hope. You little bitch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jadeja treating MS like the tail :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boult only has 2 overs??!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We need Bhuvi the batsman to step up today if the game goes deep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I needed some good news today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cricketingview More CSK!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We just need a tie you guys!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GappistanRadio Also because we saw a WC win in our lifetime!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That uncle was like sitch yo ass down! hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, Dhoni has come out to arrest collapses early in all games prior to this. Wonder why that role was given to DK today!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>132 off 101 is definitely doable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Day 5, session 3 going on here. Should India for win or shake hands?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jaddu haha!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well done, #NZ. Four years later, they are in the finals again. Go on and win it all! Good luck!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh well, we move on. Thanks for the amazing games, #TeamIndia . ‚ù§Ô∏è Chin up and let's bounce back!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He had to go for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, 148 off 20 overs. T20-tards got their wish!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's OK. Given the systems we have in place for our domestic cricket, Indian cricket teams of the future will be a given participant in semis/finals of big cricket tournaments. A major trophy is always around the corner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to hear more about how #NZ don't deserve to be in the semis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gauravsabnis Throw in the fact that we just won a Test series in Australia, I'm like, this year's already a historic year for Indian cricket. World Cup would have been a nice icing on the cake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly how I feel. The disappointment barely lingers cause India win so many games, across formats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's ok, young guy, happens. Hopefully he will learn and get better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pant, no....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am cracking jokes and shit right now jolly a, when it dawns on me that India aren't in finals on Sunday, it's gonna kill me. üò≠<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@freehit_mj Damn!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scenes if rain fucks us over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Crownish Kohli: The fuck did I do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When is dibbly dobbly de Grandhomme gonna bowl?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sooo, when's India's first Test Championship game?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kohli in semis be like: Apna time aayega!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dhoni deflects one off his pads for a leg-bye to win India the game in.....49th over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pant 100, Pandya 90*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lockheed Martin Ferguson coming to bowl now. Got one nearly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab Nah, fully expect England to choke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pandya and Pant should go full bonkers here. Fuck it, this game is gone anyway!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have NZ peaked too early? They are gonna bottle it against Australia in the final, aren't they?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stupid ICC! Always standing in the way of India's success!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck man. Ugh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn, you cannot do that! :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ganguly's voice now is all of India. Disappointment tingled with desperate hope. The worst kind!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What bowling. Uff. Eternal scrappers my ass. This is foot on throat level stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Slipping into Australian DMs like...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey man, we got our first series win in Australia! My year was made then, this woulda been a nice icing on the cake. Let's be real! #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rootofall3vil hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll take it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good bowling man, what are you gonna do about it? Rahul's shot was shit but that's all cause of good bowling. We know it because we have Bumrah doing the same to other batsmen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tame end to a very good campaign. Need to step up our knockout games. Gotta get another trophy under the belt soon with these crop of players.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All over, I can go to work today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that's that for India's campaign. Kinda saw this coming. 240 against NZ is like 280 against other teams. Throw in decent bowling conditions, and that score seems like 300+.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èMaybe but I didn't do such analysis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty sure that's out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah that looked out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kohli wants to finish it in 30 overs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Yeah, so? :) That's the way the game goes right? :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He was due a failure anyway. Alright, Kohli. Your stage is  set.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shoooot. Good bowling!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not much swing for Boult. That's good. Just need 1 guy to do a Babar and we should be OK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright, India, let's do this! Good luck. Come what may ya'll have our support!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India will take it, but NZ will too. Tough match, but let's see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another wicket but that 4 was a shit ball from Bhuvi.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another Jaddu catch. What a man!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jadeja, yet again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbennyman That and increased password sharing, which is already very prevalent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Set to launch next spring, the new service will offer original content including projects from Reese Witherspoon and Anna Kendrick   https://t.co/Gt8nxbk4k1 via @WSJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At the rate of streaming services coming up, it's going to take a fortune every month to stay subscribed to these services.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BumbleCricket Start the tuk tuk, Bumble, you've had one too many!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will they have a 40 min break between innings tomorrow? #ImportantQuestions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HBO Max, Apple's streaming service, NBC's service taking The Office away soon -- tough times for Netflix in terms of content.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sidvee Kohli really got his wish of 'Sham tak khelenge...' today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If India go on lose it tomorrow, so be it. Losing today would have sucked!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chalo ghar chalo, that's that. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How many more inspections do they need?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I mean today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really hope rain resumes and we don't get any play tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As it should be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How many overs have we lost so far? #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cricketcouch Sema blade. I lou it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndianMourinho Yeah, absolutely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndianMourinho I still remember Ganguly handing over the shared trophy to Attapatu(?) after the presentation and sadly walking away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HAHAHA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bad week for Billionaires.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At this point, I hope we don't get any play today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cricketingview Hahaha! Trump clearly agitated by India's overthrows.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2-day finish coming up. Test cricket is truly dy--what's that? This is an ODI?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EyeOnThePitch @sidin Nice read, Samir. Enjoyed that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EyeOnThePitch @sidin That's quite insane. I can't deal with a few hours of consistent, steady rain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@prakrules It was brilliant. No bias, none of the piggybacking of others' points.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@prakrules ACTUAL analysis. Brilliant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>KP trolling Sanju Manju. Lol. Only Trump left to tweet about this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EyeOnThePitch @sidin Holy moly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sachin's analysis is spot on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sidin Chennai<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India, frankly, have been quite poor since the 40th over. Not reacting well to the expected 'assault'. Bottling it in the field.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>211-5 with 3 overs to go? Man, as a Kiwi, I will be OK with that. 230 will be a good score on this wicket.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So how does Duckworth and Lewis work when there are reserve days?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the fuck kind of fielding is this man? Extras, overthrows, India are shipping runs away bc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty shit though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kohli is pissed. Hopefully can score a 100 :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Santner bowling prediction: 10-1-38-1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And just as I send that, Bhuvi strikes. Phew.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>200 up, 240-245 looks likely unless Bumrah has other ideas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, looked not out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A guy who can't put bat to ball all innings and Chahal bowls shite to him. Come on man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chahal loses the plot like no other. What the shit kind of bowling is this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kuldeep would have definitely bowled better than Chahal on this track.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ross 'midwicket' Taylor, here he comes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bad from Pandya<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lots of edges going NZ's way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OK good timely wicket. Pandya well done!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>230 and Rohit goes out cheaply means NZ are favs. This pitch is gonna get slower and slower.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sidvee @sweepstakes 227<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty shit effort from Rohit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank God! Kane!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Magic Moments from the ongoing edition of WC? Dei. I had a Magic Moment yesterday, too. Thu!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hotstarusa There were two periods of interruptions during the telecast of the ongoing India-NZ semi. Working fine now however.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chahal's gone at 5 RPO. Pretty average returns. Bowls at least 1 hit me delivery per over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Taylor and Kane have gone into Dhoni assessment mode. They know their target.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>'99 semi. I still cry!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slicesofIife He still can, our bowling has been very tight to him + he's playing the situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get one of these 2 in the next 5 overs, please!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hotstarusa You guys....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope Taylor doesn't go into "Taylor 2011 vs Pak last 6 overs mode".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Firstly googly from Chahal since the dawn of time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saw Kapil Dev at #TANA in DC over the 4th weekend. True legend!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hotstar deeply regret the inconvenience. Hmm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is turning square and India are loaded with right handers. Yikes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Steve Waugh! Legend!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kohli levels of relaxed is #goals man. He gives zero fucks these days about almost everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank Jaddu, phew. That came out of nowhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>280 still looks very much on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mannnnn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally a leg slip<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's like 5 times Nicholls has played that shot. How many more times do we let him do that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Munro would have been a good boy and gone back quietly to the dressing room. Nicholls wants attention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nicholls is going to sweep his way toward a 100 here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@enthahotness Nehra ji, somewhere, with a smile on his face: "Amateurs..."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At this rate, Kohli needs to bowl to Williamson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is containment bowling at best. Playing Nicholls into form is India of the 90s/2000s.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adiratan Yeah, despite Bhuvi doing well so far, I would have preferred Shami. He gets wickets. Nicholls holding one end up is also not a good sign. Sets it up nicely for Taylor and co.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pandya getting into some nonsense nice and early. You know what that means! Wicket loading<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adiratan Absolutely. Kane looking at extreme ease out there. Pandya and Jadeja will only help that. Kane into 'milking' mode is dangerous for us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh that looked out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kane will play till stumps and end up with 150*.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One more for Bumrah?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shot!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mo_hit Bowling has been exceptionally on point. Pitch looks good for batting. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jaddu at point. Jonty, Yuvi in his prime, Collingwood. Insert other super fielders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbennyman @aashrey_ Right here with you guys in the 'WFH' category! :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rahul to replace Pogba at United? :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That bowling had to have a wicket. Brilliant so far. Guptill has also become a walking wicket this WC. Now to target the other opener (and Kane).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jazz_CB I read this before event happened. Started celebrating before actual event happened on TV hahah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THAT"S IT. THAT"S it BABY. That's fucking it!!! LETS GOOOOO!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Need that wicket!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbennyman @Granger_Gab üôåüôè<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adiratan 280<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab üòåüòá<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab It's 5.36 AM and I am contemplating my second cup of coffee. It's gonna be a looonng day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bhuvi using conditions well. Let's get that the walking wicket soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Game so far: Wrong selection (imo), Toss (can't help it), poor review. OK, ok!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bowler's review that. Wasted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shami had NZ openers in all kinds of trouble earlier this year. Strange selection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not liking this team selection one bit. Hope I'm wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Batting first, already advantage New Zealand. #cwc19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NZ are gonna win tomorrow, aren't they? #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sdayanand Haha that's awesome! That Tresco and Strauss assault at Edgbaston I believe was something else!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sdayanand It really was. I can't recall any other series, even India ones, where I can recall details as vividly as the 2005 Ashes series. From the pre-series buildup to the last day of the 5th Test, the series constantly exceeded expectations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My favorite #Ashes2005 moment has to be Simon Jones' reverse swinging delivery to dismiss Michael Clarke. I play that on loop when I am feeling shitty in life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benjonescricket Is Warne's tally of 40 wickets the highest for a 5-match series?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In all of sporting history, 'arrogant' is the label given to successful teams/players, when usually 'confident' is a better and more apt adjective. This should not be a reason to dislike a team, any team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Thoughts? #USA #FIFAWomensWorldCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GOALLL!!!! USA!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#USA goal loading...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy birthday to India's greatest cricketer ever, @msdhoni!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimmyNeesh is probably scrolling through Twitter wondering if India won the world cup or something. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CSK-ian Faf showing true love for the yellow jersey. #Australia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India without playing, it has to be said, increased their chances of success in semis. We will see how it pans out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dilippoduval It almost always ends up this way haha, reality meeting expectations is a rarity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Carey is one for the future. He definitely plays the old brand of Aussie cricket.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did not see Australia losing this one. Very surprised!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yayyyy, firstly superb win for India, and now, thanks to SA coming in clutch, India face NZ. I definitely feel more confident now. Happy for South Africa too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Want India to win the #WC, but I will take a semis appearance any day with this quality of batting. Because I am pretty damn sure we will be here again in 4 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Yeah yeah, you are right, just saying! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KP24 Check trending topics dawg!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo I knew you were gonna say something like this the moment I RT'ed that hahah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan Perhaps to your point, if we had a h2h system as a tie breaker rather than NRR after num, that could improve the format.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cjaisree Ayyyo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like #SundarPichai was wrong by 1 game. He predicted a final between India and England.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ICC, how about a rank turner for the India semis? üòõ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having said that, I think #SouthAfrica (though super unlikely) might just end up springing a surprise. India beat SL and face NZ.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan We can go around in circles. I think this format and the table usually doesn't lie when there's a league stage. It happens in T20 franchise cricket, it happens in soccer to name just a few examples.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan I think it is. 9 games is a lot of time including adjusting for luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright, bring on #England. Road or otherwise. #CWC2019 #India<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1992 mein aisa kuch hua tha kya? üôà #CWC2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan Maybe. I'd make a case for BD to be more unlucky than Pak, at this point in time. The WI ambush hurt your chances badly. Both Pak and BD would have beaten SL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So that's curtains for Pakistan. The top 4 is a fair reflection. Australia look the strongest and have gained momentum. India, easily the 2nd best. NZ look the weakest all of a sudden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jazz_CB Add a (C) da. :P #RuleOfThrees #Consulting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KP24 KP, please opine on Jaddu's tweet on Manjrekar!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HomerOpines @sdayanand @khamaniyo @cricBC Houston, we have touchdown! hahaha üòÇüëåüòÉ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kane and Taylor should open, the batting, bowling. Everything. Be everywhere in the field, too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HomerOpines @sdayanand @khamaniyo @cricBC Homer, over rates NOW or I'm muting you :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo HAHAHAHA sorry :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>England should look to play out 50 overs and be happy with whatever they end up with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Morgan goes now. Slower ball claims him, great catch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The more Neesham bowls the more the pitch seems to be slowing down, Woakes gone. England will do well to get to 290-300 here, which might just put the game out of reach for this NZ batting line-up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HomerOpines It's more Kiwi batting that will implode, I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>England can defend 280 here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pitch is definitely slowing down a touch; NZ have adapted quickly on how to bowl here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stokes choked out now. That was a painful innings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jimmy Neesham channeling his McGrath here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Australia, India and NZ would definitely prefer Pakistan in the semis over England. A flat surface at Old Trafford or Edgbaston and it plays right into England's strengths.  #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab True. My tweet was in comparison to when Moeen was playing. Moeen better batsman than Plunkett.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some very poor cricket from Butler there. Nothing shot. One more wicket now and 300 looks distant. Long tail!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üö® It's an official collapse! Butler gone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bairstow gone. It's happening!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All set up for a grand failure!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here begins the collapse. Root gone after a Watson-esque review. This can only be good for England if Butler comes in next.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>194-1 in 30 overs. Going by the last 2 WC games, they should end with around 320-340. (Conditions notwithstanding) #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Take a bow, Baristow! Well played!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_WellOfCourse Oh shit, I completely missed that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab Yeah, that was kinda disappointed. I respected him as a pundit, he wasn't too biased or anything. But that remark was out of order.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rayudu retired? Good for him, now he can play more T20 franchise cricket. Yuvi, Gony and Rayudu now following similar path. Good on them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab Hahaha, for real! It's irritating!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kohli should have gone full Sergio Ramos and got a demerit point yesterday and got himself banned for the Sri Lanka game. Would have entered the semis on a clean slate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab Haha, might very well happen. I think BD will beat Pak for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab Yup, yup. Only chance for Pak is for NZ to beat England.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adiratan Haha, true!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someone tell Tim Southee he's not bowling at the Chinnaswamy! #RCB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PerseusDaSilva @ThePrintIndia @ChandnaHimani The pro-smoke lobbyists are out in force. Much like the past 50 years! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Roy's dismissal has to challenge Kohli's there. Left at least 50 runs out there. Root in, Kiwis can relax.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jazz_CB @Notacrickethack Lol, like that's going to happen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Notacrickethack Of course, it goes both ways. If the pitches and conditions don't suit the strength of your current team, then both sides will always complaint. It's nauseating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sanjay Manjrekar DM-ed me once. I was happy that a celeb replied to me back then. Not so sure how I'd react if that happened these days!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All this accusing England to be flat track bullies is bullshit and hypocritical. Even more so when it comes from subcontinent cricket watchers. Let's take a look at 90s, 2000s pitches back home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>England looking good here. Looks like a 330 wicket. If England do lose, then Pak are surely favs at Lords where fast bowlers usually thrive. BD severely understrength in that department.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus with a tap in for the ages. Argentina have started like shit, more into kicking #Brazil than kicking the ball.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jazz_CB üòÇüòÇüòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The first time they showed that ma'am on TV, I knew the cameras would constantly go back and had a hunch that she may be visited by some Indian players. That was all around a heart warming moment. Insane passion at 87!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CricketMedicine Yeah, I agree bro<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sharan_L @cupsofchaii @kashhrz @devilakif üòÇüòÇüëå<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Barry, looking forward to the next pod. Gonna be spicy with post-world-up-exit @maxrushden :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maxrushden Tough luck, Max! Maybe your cricket team can bring cheer tomorrow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Justice!!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ #FIFAWFC2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We've got an assembly line of talent, good systems in place, good coaches. Everything is slowly and steadily falling into place for Indian cricket.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another big tournament, another semis appearance. This is just the beginning. We may miss out like the anomaly of 2017 final but 9 times out of 10, we will make the knockouts in the next 2 decades unless something dramatic happens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo @EyeOnThePitch Kinda hoping SA beat Australia, Ind beat SL and Pak make it through. I'd definitely fancy my chances against Pak than NZ/England.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo True, I agree. Overall favs are Aus yeah.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Into the semis. Literally comes down to the moments now. Averaging all the performances from the 8 league games so far would make us favorites in the semis. Quietly optimistic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well played, BD. Super team!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are days when you won't click as a bowling unit but you win ugly. Today was definitely that. Bumrah bailed India out here, on Shami's off day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bumrah is the Sachin of our bowling. Time and again he delivers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Botting job loading<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's OK Shami, no worries. Off day hota hai<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank fuck for bumrah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India bottling it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India's worst day in the field despite what looks like a win at the moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok finish this now, please<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely no pressure and Shami with 2 rubbish deliveries. Discipline man!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope Bumrah isn't injured. Might as well book the return flight tonight if that's the case. #Overthetop<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pandya mimics himself and delivers. Perfect use of conditions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pandya! That should be game, set and semis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan As is common, when your team is doing well, it's hard to take a step back and analyze objectively. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For a 5th bowler (who I kept shitting on), Pandya gets more than a decent hustle going!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mo_hit Yeah true! Backing up was poor too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan Bangladesh did well, too. Credit to their bowlers. Forgive me for getting carried away! Lol. Good bowling + slow pitch = induced it, much like in the last game. I got my assessment wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FUCK YEAH PANDYA! GET IN YOU WEST INDIAN!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mo_hit Even the usual ones are not faring well. DK is a good outfielder despite being a keeper. Pant is a liability though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the fuck kind of fielding are India putting on today. Pathetic. Straight from 90s man!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>70M for #Maguire? What is the world coming to!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bagrat15 I heard his younger brother Dilmah is also a good batsman. #byeee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbennyman True, true!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bagrat15 üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Partnership of close to 50 at run a ball chasing 315 and anxiety builds for me. Very low threshold for my patience. Want wicket every 4-5 overs. I never learn!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>^ who is this fraud spreading fake news! üëÄ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chahal, Shakib, Mahmudullah (not playing today) can face and thrive against spin, day in, day out. Get Bumrah/Bhuvi in now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pandya getting into rhythm with some filth, wicket incoming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bhuvi 2-over spell with cutters and knuckle balls, please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>104 for 2 in 20. #Ban will be happier with that than India.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think a Bhuvi over is required to pull the rate back a bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InnoBystander You should mute your timeline. This won't go down well with many.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good batting by #Ban so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the game here for India. Come on lads!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hardik has mastered the art of breaking partnerships with some utterly shit bowling. Turns all batsmen into Hafeez. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The longer Chahal goes wicketless the most restless Twitter is gonna be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4 overs of filth from Shami.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shami!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pandya, Soumya, Plunkett -- mimic what these biwkrs did and this match is easily India's. Not worried one bit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, the world will find faults even if you end up finding a cure for cancer.  Lol. Can't please some folks! #Dhoni<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India have more than enough on board. Bowlers and co should take us home from here. #cwc19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TL needs to calm the fuck down about Dhoni. Today's innings was perfectly done. We are not England where No. 10 can bat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dhoni thanks India is 40 ahead of par.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>9 needed off final over for 320.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Played Ms!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even the greatest cricketer India has produced isn't above criticism. #Dhoni<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shoooottt MS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hit a few balls in the air, MS! C'maaan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>300 should be enough but would have preferred 320.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's attribute India's slowing down completely to the pitch as is customary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Need top order to fire. Top order does fire. Now we want them to bat 40 overs too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@freehit_mj Against England right, defending a low score?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a shot in anger from Dhoni.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>KD and finding gaps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shakib, brilliant again, bowled at the right pace on this pitch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bye-bye, 320. Hello, 300!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shakib yet again ffs. Well played, Pant!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#June30MeinBhiYehiHuaTha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pant is tailor made for this. I'll see myself out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mortaza is a quality captain. Reads the game very well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our own Doctor Strange #Dhoni<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright, 290 please and some good bowling should win us this game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TL meltdown when reality doesn't meet expectations. Got way too excited for Pant and Pandya.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Inspired fielding position from BD. Rare failure for Pandya.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By Kohli's batting standards, this has been an average tournament.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Soft underbelly time! My prediction of 320 looks increasingly distant, probably don't need that many for a win, though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No pace on the wicket to play that pull regardless of boundary size. Rohit almost got out, Kohli does get out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CricCrazyNIKS Exactly my thoughts. Very refreshing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@enthahotness Free a vidu amma ve<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rohit clearly was batting on a different wicket than the rest seem to be. We used to say only for Kohli but sure as hell can say that for Rohit too. His maturity also accelerated like his batting, exponentially!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still sticking with this but it'll take some hitting for new guys to get us here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rohit has had enough of this "being born in Kohli era" talk and decided to take things into his own hands. Master!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kohli's turn to bat till stumps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rahul's rate should give a actual indication of how this pitch is behaving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I predict 320.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After that innings, to get out to that shot is disappointing. Well played!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Abbey yaar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rohit doing Rohit things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rahul's playing good second fiddle here but rotation of strike is very bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Early days but looks like another hugely significant toss to win. #INDvsBAN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shabaaa Rahul!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's more like Rohit. Authority!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow Rohit puts that away every time. Lucky!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dada begs your pardon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Janab_e_Ali Big loss. Hard to replace his quality overnight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Janab_e_Ali Without doubt man, we struggle even if one of them fails.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cricketcouch Your lack of intent in having an open discussion on Dhoni is appalling :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dilippoduval @khamaniyo Yeah, fair enough. Oh well, fair fucks to England. They were better today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dilippoduval @khamaniyo The lack of intent was for the most part induced by England's bowling in the first 10. Rohit struggled for timing from the get-go and Kohli looked edgy for the first 20-30 mins of his innings, too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dilippoduval @khamaniyo It was either this approach or go after the bowling early and risk beng 80 or 90 for 3 after 15 which could have happened given England's good bowling. In both scenarios, the root cause of the problem is a weak middle order.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the other hand, the bright side of today's defeat. üòÇüëå<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab Hehe, I am having one of those days where cynicism wins and perspective goes for a toss!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab I want assurances! NOW. üò≠<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbennyman üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody do the math and tell me how much India can lose to BD and SL by and still make semis. Lift my Sunday, please!üò≠ #iCrie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sidvee Yeah, for real!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cjaisree Yeah, hopefully doesn't happen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbennyman I see. Hopefully we can win both!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sidvee He asked Morgan (jokingly): "So that NZ game must be easy now?" to which Morgan was like: "No, no, not at all." Felt out of place to shove that kind of humor in there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>we*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can India still go out if we lose both our games?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sidvee True, that NZ easy comment/question was needless. Humor going wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>England out-bowled India. Kohli pointed that out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab Lol, people like to find comfort in bubbles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Manju trying some dumb fuck humor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Smash and become all out for 280, that would have given me more joy. Lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbennyman Yeah,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan It's quite frustrating man. He's a great player but looks spent in these kind of situations. Intent wasn't there. We are too reliant on Rohit/kohli.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbennyman I would stick with our spinners, shouldn't have a knee jerk reaction. Kedar on the other hand, poor guy looks out of depth and a role poorly defined. KD should replace him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love Dhoni like most Indians, but bloody hell, that was torturous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sri Lanka might be a straightforward game. BD definitely the tougher of the 2 games. Hope India don't stumble having done almost everything necessary to make it to semis. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's OK, gotta put it behind us and fine-tune our batting approach next game. 1 out of 2 games and we should be in the semis. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India's batting had the ability to win this. However, the approach was poor. Despite Shami's expensive end, 338 was chaseable. Batting lost us this game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mo_hit Absurd logic really. Scrambled thinking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ganguly is pissed and I am totally with his. Fucking bullshit effort man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Hmm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan Quite awful really. No intent from these 2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bhenchod, what the flying fuck is the point of this? What is a Jadhav btw? Surely India can do better than this?!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright, poorly executed chase. Hope we put this behind us and win 1 out of the remaining 2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dada is quite pissed at this effort. Rightly so, weird approach. Hit or get out man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Hmm. Interesting. Moeen is good if you want containment, Adil definitely a better wicket taking option.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Who would you replace though? Adil?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was a typical sub-continental wicket where toss literally gives you massive advantage. Got softer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>10-0-55-3. That's impressive man. Plunkett over Moeen on pitches like this for me any day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well bowled, Plunkett and England. Good try, Pandya!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good field set, good bowling to back that up from England.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was a boundary ball man Pandya. FUCK!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is excellent bowling by England.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rashid's lengths will be hard to get under. Gotta think of a counter plan and do it reaaal quick!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Viju bhiaya needs to send 92 rupees for India win! #hotstarads<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bagrat15 Definitely that last ball he should have left<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THat's a drop<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Phew!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Archer's lengths will trouble Dhoni.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well left by Dhoni. Steady start towards stumps! :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Baristow had an Apple Watch on, he'd have finished his Move and Exercise rings twice or thrice over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That catch gets better with every replay!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cricketingview But cross seam extracting unpredictable bounce!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>England catching like they want to stay in the World Cup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOKE catch. wow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You put anything in Pandya's mouth and his chewing will mush the fuck out of it. That poor chewing gum!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sidvee Topped at 16.3M a couple of overs ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh yeah Pandya toying with the field. 3 men in the deep on leg side and he found the gap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No one:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that's curtains for this chase. Well played, Rohit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's our 10!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He don't need no bat to score runs. Pfft!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pant hates his bat!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice, even 150 required off last 15. Definitely possible. IPL vs The Hundred :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TestingRhymes Send Dhoni in to play till stumps! :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>11 runs aaram se<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too much to ask for any player, let alone a young kid like Pant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kohli has spoiled us where he scores 100s for fun. This lull is annoying. Lol!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lots of cross seam deliveries from Plunkett. Quite good at that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pant, it's ok, calm down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He gets bored or what. Nervous 60s FFs! #Kohli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kya yaar, bullshit shot from Kohli.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, Liam Plunkett has been playing for ages it seems like!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who comes next? Pant?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OK Archer brought back, that's a big win for India.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sharma jeeeee! GET IN!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think only ABdV comes close to Rohit when it comes to acceleration of an innings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uff, shabaaaaa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuckin A, what a shot, Rohit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stokes and Rashid helping India's cause here. Treated with disdain!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well played, Rohit! Scratchy but I'll take it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's more like it, Rohit. Hang around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kohli is hands down the greatest ODI batsman ever. Takes the bowling and pitch outa the equation. It's always Kohli vs Kohli. He chooses when to score, he chooses to take it easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kohli 50. Another 150 please!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan It wasn't other wordly, fair enough but most teams wouldn't have managed this is what I am saying. Maybe Australia. This was the England of the past 4 years on show here. Not the ones who played the tournament thus far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan I completely disagree. Innings usually lose momentum when batsman try to up the ante. This was induced by India's good middle order bowling. Shami was expensive; Bumrah kept them down. I have to credit the bowlers here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kohli entering "Sham tak khelenge toh inki gaand phategi" territory here. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan It's true man!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We can chase 90 in last 10. Take the game deep lads!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kohli with 2 amazing shots. I can turn my TV off, go do other things with my Sunday a happy man, regardless of what happens next.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shot!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exceptional bowling. Great respect shown by Kohli and Rohit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What enthralling cricket! Love it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kohli 200 loading...#CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on yaar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #Eng are quick learners, they will be trying to take pace off the ball fairly quickly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody tell #Rahul that #KingsXI need to win the game in like 11 overs or something, and wait for it, #CSK is bowling. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aha_irshi @Granger_Gab Was specifically talking about England game :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab Might as well put our name on the cup :p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bumrah is the bowling equivalent of Sachin. May this be the beginning of future Bumrahs for generations to come! #CWC2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>338. #2011MeinBhiYehihuatha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any other bowling attack after that start would have definitely wilted and conceded 400. Even on a supposedly "bad" bowling day, India can be proud of that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, 338 after that start? That's incredible from India. Only Australia of the past can boast of that level of comebacks. Insanely good from India! #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How do you go for 43 in 9.5 overs man. You CANNOT do that, Bumrah! #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a no ball?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck yes, Bumrah! That was a great contest!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Given the start, 400 looked like a given. I think India will be happy in that context, but this score, I feel, is out of hand for our batting. #TeamIndia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanThomasESPN Boooo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OK, that's just nonsense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bumrah has spoiled us Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, that was a good shot. Credit to Stokes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YESSS!!! SHAMI KEBAB GETS 5-FER!‚ô•Ô∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good bowling. Batsman had no idea Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>17 and Butler's wicket. Fuck it, I'll take it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck me. What shit over<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor from Shami. Bad over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>300 in 46.3. I'll take that for #TeamIndia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maxrushden @Jaspritbumrah93 He's good eh, Max!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stunning from Bumrah. That's as good, if not better, than seeing a batsman go bonkers at the death.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aha_irshi Oh lord hahah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What bowling man! Uff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Rahul opens, he better run like these guys today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is hella exciting cricket. Shami/Bumrah vs Stokes/Butler. High octane stuff!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well played, Ben $%^#!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OH MAN! THat was out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sdayanand üòÇüëå<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No! Root! Give him second batting. That was a try ball!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pandya 10 overs for 60. I'll take that on this pitch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pant's batting started already...in the field.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what Root Academy teaches you. #Instarem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TestingRhymes I think Bumrah improvised there to Stokes' premeditation. Quality cricket all around!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bowling yaar!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@enthahotness Link iruka?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tough day for #Chahal. Happens!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can we have Atherton to commentate for 100 overs? #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shot!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India reading the conditions really quickly and adapting with our bowling. Brilliant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent from Shami!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reverse?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#InstaremRoot is struggling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only Sanju Manju's commentary skills regresses faster than my typing skills when a wicket falls. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's how you bowl a short ball. That's how you catch, too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#sceneonhai<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>MC Ben Stokes in now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KP24<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Catching yuaar! Fuck yeahhhh Shamiiiiiii pressure brings wickets laddds!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Definitely starting to slow down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@krtgrphr And now we see Nehra ji in Magic Moments! Timing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbennyman Seriously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HAHAHA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What do you mean for no reason they slowed down? What the fuck Sanjay?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YESSSSSSS Shami!!!! quieten them down<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lovely from Chahal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>6.69. Keep it down boys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another good over from Pandya, taking pace off the ball.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>200 in 29.4 for the loss of 1 wicket. Gulp. If India manage to restrict them below 400, it'll be a great comeback!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More power to @isaguha for co-commentating with Sanjay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Couple of good overs from Pandya. Helps!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, that's just good batting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well played, Baistow! Proper knock.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not trying to get the batsman out? Lol Sanjay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, so should my future girlfriend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guys, there was no 2 there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on boom boom, wicket please!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sdayanand Yes sir üòÉ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somewhere Ricky Ponting is fuming that a sub is having a crazy impact on the game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Literally bought that wicket out of nowhere for India, did Jadeja.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WHAT A FUCKING CATCH! GET THE FUCK IN!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is why we need Jadeja clones like #Westworld for Indian cricket.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't believe Sreesanth was part of the 2011 WC squad. hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What times we are living in when Indians are complaining that there is nothing in the pitch for bowlers. Testament to our bowlers really! üëå<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>315*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sachin did say 350+...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lolol Here we go<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>98 between 11-20. Jeez.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's get that first one lads<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope KL isn't too badly hurt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Roy doesn't hit, he fucking bludgeons it. Jeez.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just hope the pitch holds for 100 overs and doesn't slow up much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A very good over from Chahal goes for 6. That kinda day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indian fans on my TL bitching about pitch is hilarious. Aren't we the OG flat track bullies?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bairstow is Pakistani in disguise. Plays mental when there is strong criticism of him/his team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rohit 150 and Kohli 180 to take India home today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is sensational hitting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OK well played, Bairstow. Proper luck riding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab Ok ok hope so :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab Also, losing against favs can dent confidence big time. I couldn't give a fuck about Pak's fortunes to be honest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Roy is lethal. I remember when he was a pure slogger and plays dumb shots to get out. Not any longer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab Yeah, I will probably feel like that afterward. But in the moment, it's annoying :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>England playing the brand of cricket that made them favorites for this World Cup. Ok, Ok, time to react, India. Let's go!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab Yeah, it's a tough one, I have some sympathy for all parties. Just frustrated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, I went to sleep at 12.30, woke up at 5 with a hangover to see DRS not used. Fuck!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kuldeep to derail this batting like some shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab In first viewing, yeah, I was like surely they had to review! mannn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jadhav and Rohit might come into play here. Spin it to win it here. Already it's gripping and turning. 2nd innings gonna be a bitch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hardik should bowl spin. Fuck any pace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bring Kuldeep on next over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DUDE. WTF. I could heard on TV man the edge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No bat?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here comes Malcolm Marshall to run through England. #Pandya<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Super bowling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bowled yaar!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bumrah ji bowling on a different pitch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2 poor deliveries to end a good over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shabash Bumrah. Good bowling. Shami, too. Despite the score, India have bowled well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbennyman Batting second on this wicket with our long tail is not going to be easy.  Unless Kohli/Rohit play out of their skins, I don't see us chasing 350.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbennyman 320-330 I will be OK with. Anything above that, I won't be too comfortable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OK, I sense a 350-370 score from #Eng here. I hope I am wrong. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Abbey shit, how many inside edges!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dei Sanju Manju to open the innings a.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bairstow lucky already. Walking wicket from here....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy shit man, this is a fuckng batting wicket and a half!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gimme some of that orange please! #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>COME ON INDIAAA!!!! #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LEGOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OK bowling first on an amazing batting deck? Challenge accepted. Let's go India!! #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is #Canada losing to #Haiti right now? #GoldCup2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Janab_e_Ali For real haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Australia juggernaut scares me man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a catch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CdG. Lulz!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had my money on Carey dropping it. Lol! Shit from Taylor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Australia bowling is getting into "183 all out" levels of good here. Not good for the rest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just give the trophy to #Uruguay and spare us more penalty shootouts man. #CopaAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jofra Archer, Mitchell Starc. Such seamless action man and what pace they generate too. Amazing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An audible gasp from Williamson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ajarrodkimber Staunch supporter of Gulbadin's school of captaincy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ajarrodkimber Hafeez's itch is growing on the bus journey back to the hotel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TestingRhymes Yeah, he gives that vibe. Then tries to laugh it off. Feel like he's the kind of subhuman shit who says the wrong things and goes like "Oh I was just kidding"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When the game gets tense, a coherent sentence from Ramiz is gold. Forget about insights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TestingRhymes Yeah, I dunno the context either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NZ should let Kane and Taylor open. Replace Guptill and Munro/Nichols with 2 fast bowlers. #FuckIt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TestingRhymes Yeah, it was definitely serious. Slater tried to play it down Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can start by stop making stupid comments. Less is more man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like casual cricket fans who show up when there's a WC on, there are cricketers who do the same. Wahab Riaz leading the class.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Death, taxes and Williamson nuding the ball to third man for single (and NZ's victory).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lol idiots from both sides. It's a sport man, go home and outrage on Twitter like the pros.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having levied all the criticism on Naib, well done to #Imad for holding one end even though he read Rashid like he was reading a text written in Aramaic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sarfaraz: We are not thinking about that ga-...actually we all are watching! (When asked about India-England game tomorrow) üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To those calling for India to lose tomorrow to mess with  Pak's chances. Lol. Do you even know Kohli?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üëå<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bad news for Bangladesh: Pak used up their bottle job against Afghanistan except Afghanistan brought their bottling capabilities at the same fucking time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely comical fielding. You can almost fucking hear the crash and burn of this defense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good game #Afghanistan. That review (the one taken and the one not given) and of course, who can forget that Naib over. Threw away the game when #Pak were self-imploding. Learn and come back stronger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He doesn't need no fingers does Wahab. Lol!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will be fitting if Wahab smacks Gulbadin for six to hand Pak this game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Momentum is a faltu word that's true. Absolute cunt of an over before, even Rashid looks toothless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hang your head in shame man. Where was the team's goal in that? Fucking idiot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nos. 7 and 8 and you have a top spinner and you bowl your garbage. I want Afghanistan to lose and this guy be made the cause of it. That'll end his career.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh my God, this guy is the worst cricketer ever. Fuck this guy. Hope he gets booted from Afghanistan soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gulbadin what the fuck man!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Proper bonus over for Afghanistan. Still fancy Pak to win this though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That Mujeeb review has to be one of the worst since DRS came into play. And there are many contenders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kya fielding hai ye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely useless bowler, worse captain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Regardless, I think teams could use some guidelines/framework when it comes to reviews.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gulbadin??? wtf why are you bowling!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hardly a surprise to be honest, the moment Afghanistan posted 200+.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got to say this is the most Pakistan thing ever. #Pakistan #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another hatrick! Brilliant from Boult!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TRENT BOULT! ‚ô•Ô∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, there should be a DRS coach for teams. It really shouldn't be as impulsive as it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get Sarfaraz and this should be in the bag for Afghanistan, I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nooooo that was out man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck. What a game on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Afghanistan look hella determined. Hope they pull this off!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is Shinwari bowling now? Lol you are defending 228 man, know your strengths and be brave, Gulbadin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If not for the poor fielding, catching and questionable bowling switches, Afghanistan should have had Pakistan on the mat by now. Despite all those points, Pakistan are struggling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lockie with some serious pace!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is more spice in Pak-Afg games than India-Pak games these days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo You are probably right, but Pak batting is due another collapse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo True that. Hoping Afg get to 230 somehow. Should be enough with their spin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could use an #Aus defeat here. #CWC19<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@the_topspin Good discussions with family and friends. I don't think this world cup did anything to kindle the interests of non-cricket fans.

<|startoftext|>I know no player is above criticism, but every time I even think Dhoni isn't doing the right thing, I am invariably proven wrong in hindsight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait, Heymeyer doesn't want batting. Rahul should have given him one more chance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@prakrules HAHAHA reverse Australia cracked me up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kohli walks without nicking, Pandya doesn't appeal for a clean catch. Ladsssss kya ho raha hai<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bumrah's like leave some wickets for me. He's the kinda guy who brings a 24-pack even when it's not BYOB. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kohli has been on the money with batting and captaincy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dhoni byes. OK. But thalaaaaaa. Whattay catch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those 3 deliveries, Absolutely majestic man. Love the flight. Dhoni is Yoda behind the wickets. Great setup for that wicket.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's very unlike Dhoni.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beauty. That was coming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dhoni and byes eh...hmm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And as predicted he gets rewarded. Lulls the batsmen into a false sense of comfort with rubbish and sucker punches them with an average delivery. Hey, it works!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pooran is going to win this for West Indies with the amount of luck he's had today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get Chahal in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the fuck is Hardik bowling man, absolute nonsense!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Harmless from Kuldeep. Also, WI have played him well so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pandya with more tripe, which means he will take a wicket soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Much better second.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dei, Pandya wants a wicket off every delivery. Stick to a line/length man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Malcom Marshall mode on, no luck yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a great first over from Kuldeep so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is that Jaddu in the field? #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time and again our fast bowlers set up the platform for spinners to thrive. Long may that continue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Superb fast bowling man. I can't even!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yelled out a big MC/BC and a fish pump that my Apple Watch picked up as a workout. Looool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FUCK YEAH, GET IN SHAMI KEBAB!!!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Man, what a time to be alive when you can take Indian fast bowlers delivering for granted. iCry tears of happiness. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jazz_CB I hope you're right da!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jazz_CB Porumai :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And just like that! Shami - A thing like that! #MadMen #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sensing a wicket here, come on lads!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good start by India, maybe a little fuller length would be nice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't review.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cricketcouch Does "Universal Boss" count?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright, India. Let's do this! #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>West Indies have the batting to win it in 35-40 overs -- win it that is, either for themselves or for the opposition. For India's sake, I hope it's the latter. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shankar/Jadhav -- one of these 2 has to go and Pant has to come regardless of the outcome today. Knowing India's need to stick to same team and all that, I know this won't happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dhoni's innings was typical Dhoni in the past few years. His final flourish masked his bigger problems of strike rotation against slow bowlers. He can show more intent at the start I guess, but that also means we may not have got the end we did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Loved watching Trescothick in full flow. Quality player!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, 268 in the end, at least 20 below par, I think. We have the bowling to cope though. I dunno what to make of that innings. Need another 50 overs to come to a decisive take on India's batting approach. Mixed feelings at the moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>O Shame Thomas, ting ting! #GameofThrones #ShameWalk #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We love you Dhoni  https://t.co/CnEWPKl3Ri<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have a left hander! See, there IS variety in this line-up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cricketingview Imagine how bad the rest must be!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just declare now man. Dhoni isn't interested, rest can't hold a bat to save their lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well played, Pandya. Gave some respectability to this crawling innings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know there is an urge to send Pandya up the order here but that will be attacking the symptom. Problem is Dhoni's slow starts and lack of aggression.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dilippoduval Hahaha üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dilippoduval Permission to smash your streaming device into bits?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kohli kinda checked his shot there. Maybe that's his undoing? Fuck man, disappointing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck me sideways. That's 2 soft dismissals in a row for Kohli.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India rotating strike like how Pakistan do it chasing a 300+ score.  Fuck all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India playing more like United than City. #CWC19 #Manchester<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent spell from Roach.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surely that was out....you know conclusive evidence and all that bullshit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the fuck kind of cricket was that by firstly, Dhoni, then by the keeper!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, mid-on can only be up...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mid-on up and choking the runs with some good bowling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India's rotation has been poor today. I don't buy that the pitch is playing any tricks. Just bad batting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Roach with that wide angle is awesome. Squaring up batsmen here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kohli emptied his bowels. Now, time to thwart the bowlers. #Sorry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbennyman That's a fair point. I am banking on our top order to deliver big in knockouts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dhoni half-sleeve mode on. India set for 300 here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty abject stuff from India barring Kohli. Our weak link becomes weaker and weaker by the game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And yeah that's out. Clear sound on first take as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Im sure tha'ts out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>big nick surely!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kedar Yaadav plays these shots that come out of absolutely nowhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't think Shankar is getting replaced anytime soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kohli carrying India forward once again. Another 80 runs from him at least, I hope!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Kohli needs to play an MC-BC innings from here to get India to 300.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pitch it up and swing it. Good line and length from Roach. Too good for Vijay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good shot, but that over should have gone for 10 at least. Oh well, I am being a little bitch right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is Kohli even playing this game? Seems to go off-strike immediately, only for the remaining over to peter out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gayle hasn't really gone crazy in this tournament yet. India are known to get any kind of batsman into form. Hope it doesn't happen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EyeOnThePitch True that! When batting first, the lull between a fall of a wicket to the next batsman getting going goes on for longer than ideal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Retributions Not out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Kohli is a poor man's #Babar...üëÄ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing about Shankar, Jadhav, Dhoni inspires confidence. Either in building an innings or launching at the death.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good ball. Holder tied both these guys down. KL kinda did his job I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I took a shot for every single India took off Holder after 4 overs, I'd still be perfectly sober to drive. Come on you guuyyyssss. Singeeels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EyeOnThePitch  https://t.co/6SahjsagMw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First single off Holder in 3 overs. I need a smoke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quite poor batting from #India. No aggression, neither good rotation of strike. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>40M for #Kovacic. Transfer ban makes you do funny things. #CFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish I had the confidence of the third umpire in this game in any decision I take in life. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dude Rahul, on this wicket, 25 off 42 is not good enough man. Gap finding needs to improve and fast.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go on, give this one out too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>KL has some good release shots, but he needs to rotate the strike more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some lovely shots so far from India today. Absolutely creaming it! Looks a great wicket too. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cricketingview It's 50-50, true; had the on-field umpire gave it out and third ump stuck with it, no problem. Except, that wasn't the case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like a 330 wicket. Hope India get there. I am never comfortable with #WestIndies chasing despite India's superior bowling. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, you know it's a blatantly bad decision when you have to agree with Sanju Manju. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh well, cricket, like any other sport, continues to suffer from officials who are still coming to terms with technology. Maybe they'll get better with better coaching and best practices to follow. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Third umpire didn't even mention the pad. Bizarre umpiring.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait, WHAT? How? Haha :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beautiful drive from KL. Seems like there's no swing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rohit is a pull-shot god! #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warren. DRINK!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, here come the debates. A shot for every #Dem candidate running as of now and I will most likely be dead. #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Well yeah that's what I meant to say haha, now that I read it again Lool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope #India chase tomorrow. Need some more exposure chasing too, so far have won only 1 game chasing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks to rain, Sri Lanka beating England and Pakistan being Pakistan, this world cup is officially fucking üî• and I love it! Peak unpredictability galore! #cwc19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This world cup. Bonkers. Well played, Pakistan. England, be worried.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By far a coming of age innings. Hundreds while chasing and your team winning is what it's all about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From potential loss to scraping win to a comprehensive win. That's Pakistan's chase today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>England still have it in their hands if they wanna reach semis. I hope India royally fuck them over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Superb knock from Babar chasing a low total holding together a fragile batting order. Old mantra of wickets in hand does it again. #cwc19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just give the world cup to Pakistan and save the next couple of weeks. #cwc19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kane's missed a trick not playing Ish Sodhi here. And again with some bowling changes, taking Santner off after 1 six was bizarre. Munro to bowl a bowler was another scrambled thinking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New Zealand despite their recovery were 20-25 short. Then, they followed up with not too great bowling with 237 on the board, except for Boult.  Barring the Imam wicket, their bowling hasn't threatened enough. Fakhar and Hafeez went out to silly shots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only Pakistan can throw this game from here and even they'd have to out-do some of their past collapses to make that happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing comes of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boult response loading..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stunning batting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a response from Babar. Great contest. Boult fiyaahh tho!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ignore my previous tweet. Lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very little swing from Boult, Henry all over the place. Pakistan will have to continue batting like Fakhar to lose this one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some hideous batting to some ordinary bowling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's more like it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Garbage from #NZ so far. Aptly put away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope more Indian players take this route if they don't see any prospects of Indian cricket or IPL call up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think Pak will cruise to this total. Manage Boult and this is theirs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TestingRhymes Nice. Thanks for the link. I remember that series vividly for Simon Jones' ball reverse (particularly that one to dismiss Clarke) and the Flintoff around the wicket angles to Gilchrist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TestingRhymes I see. That's quite cool. I only had a vague idea of reverse swing. Thanks for the little education!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Easy to say with hindsight that Shadab was a huge miss. Boy, he was a huge miss for Pak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TestingRhymes Gotcha. So release particularly doesn't matter yeah?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TestingRhymes I believe Wasim Akram mentioned during Pak's last game that having a round arm action enables to create the angle of the seam.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndianMourinho NO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No team performs better when the world closes in on them than #Pak. Why the let the world close in on them in the first place is a mystery along the lines of what comes after death. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If India qualifies, I hope we get to play #NZ. I'd definitely fancy our chances against #NZ than #Aus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That took all of 7 mins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The walking wicket Munro still on while Guptill is gone. Pak already at a 2-wicket (almost) advantage. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Retributions Proper worried now. Hope it's unfounded!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlieDayQuote Ayyyooooo bitches!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was actually pretty calmy dealt with in the face of some silly questioning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚ô•Ô∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>See Finch, why not bring your best bowler sooner? #Starc #AUSvENG #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When things don't go your way, even Jos Butler mistimes it. England are almost out of this game. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh yes sir, it is!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>England's World Cup unraveling is a cause for celebration. #cwc19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck off English crowd lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üëå<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully a 300+ score from #aus here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is too enjoyable from #WahabRiaz with the old ball reversing. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course it's Amir. Faf nowhere close it. That's the game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice flight by Shadab. Guy's got skills.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is sad to see from #SouthAfrica. Past teams fought till the end. This team looks weak on paper and there's almost a resigned feel to it even before a ball is bowled.   Hope they bounce back strongly and put this tournament behind them. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>de Kock getting out to spin is almost a given these days. Tries the high percentage release shots thanks to his inability to rotate the strike. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>de Kock signalled that shot for the past few overs. Poor planning, worse execution. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why Chennai, India's Sixth Biggest City, Has Run Out of Water  https://t.co/Iw3Hvtd3nQ via @EARTH3R<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Somebody tell #dekock he's playing for #mumbaiindians. That might help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, how many are #Pakistan going to win by against this Mickey Mouse #SouthAfrica side? #cwc19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Full toss after tull toss. Lol bowling. #SAvPAK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Given the way #SA have batted, this score is already beyond them. #cwc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's more like it. Sohail putting the filth away. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sohail has played well. But god, South Africa have bowled utter rubbish here. Better batting side than Pak would have aimed at 350 on this wicket with this kind of bowling. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to Wasim Akram regaling us with tales of Pak's '92 win makes for excellent listening. Lots of nostalgia in his tone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dirty bowling from #SouthAfrica. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üòç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Music stops play. That's cricket for ye! #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suhrith I see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pakistan's innings hasn't been chanceless. #SA poor yet again. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sanjaymanjrekar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suhrith @cornerd Why is that, Suhrith? You think he gives more due to Kohli's body language than his fielding skills?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sdayanand üò≠üò≠<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sdayanand It hurts. More so after a couple of drinks. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We got a Brett Lee-Flintoff moment there. Was it #Taylor? #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well played, Brathwaite. The others who batted like they had a train to catch, fuck off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh no no no no no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope India's win today dusts off whatever cobwebs there may have been.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who is coaching these set of WI players? Need to root cause this. This is not an ability issue, this is definitely their think tank/mentoring/direction problem from the men behind the scene.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ian Bishop if flipping fuming. Rightly so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor from Windies. Very poor and disappointing as a neutral.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bumrah, Nabi, Shami -- 3 MoM candidates for today's game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab Yeah, his is what we expect from a professional athlete and he delivers time and again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hetmyer's entire innings made you question if there was a need to play the shots he played. He got over 50 with that approach. And now he's gone by the same approach.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WestIndies playing their brand of cricket here. Attack, attack, attack. The OG. (England poor imitators...)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hetmyer batting as if he's chasing 500. All by himself. Read the game situation man!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gayle on a roll here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bumrah after that 6 is peak Bumrah. Num 1 for a reason!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shami you beauty, Bumrah you even bigger beauty. Deserving!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HATRICKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nabi you beauty. Thanks for the entertainment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shami bringing his IPL death bowling here....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dude, that was a six delivery. Shami kebab came in clutch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bumrah with clutch af deliveries. Chalo SHami bhai, stage is set! Bring it home<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nabi is majestic. Ice cold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nabi wow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CricketMedicine shit see<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CricketMedicine shitt tyaaaarrr so close!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was the game there man fuckkk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They can afford to lose 2 wickets in 4 overs and still score these runs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is proper T20 territory. Which means no favors for either set of players. Negates itself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on India, choke this out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CricketMedicine What a CALL sir jee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Give this man the trophy @CricketMedicine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shot yaar!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bumrah can't do it alone man. Some support needed from the rest too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India have been pretty poor in the field, except for Kohli and Chahal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kedhar Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Short ball to Rashid please<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CricketMedicine And he goes for 4 ugh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GappistanRadio To be fair to Chahal, he has been setting India's fielding standard (high) today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Need a tight Shami over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CricketMedicine Haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HomerOpines He was way too short. He has enough runs to flight the ball and tempt them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dude, so much width. WTF. Chahal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India's deep tail is winning them the game (ish).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CricketMedicine Dickon Tarly approves this message!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Manjrekar: "All becoming a bit too easy for India." Which game is this guy watching?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright, Bumrah in next over, please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was not a wide. Wtf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great shot! Zadran has looked comfortable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on lads, one final effort over the finish line!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Average Hardik over but had to get that out of the way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a great game. Not enjoyable when you have a vested interest in one team's fortunes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fucking shit ball to end over so much width<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is jadeja on the field yet lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>VS having a shit day in the field.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This Indian office TV show commerical on Hotstar has cringe in every second of this trailer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on lads, let's squeeze this one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chahal you beauty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bumrah jeeeeeee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yesssssssss grtttt the fuckkkkkk innnnnn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About fucking time. That's the standard of fielding Vijay Shankar watch and learn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aashrey_ Some people are idiots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dude that was out?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the fuck dude vs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll take that wicket now, thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Feel bad the guy. He shouldn't have to defend yawning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on lads<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trash from kullly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Williamson's world and we are just living in it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is proper batting now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Manjrekar, say that shit on Twitter man. Not on air you biased idiot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shot!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That wicket helps. Get the spinners on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pandya rewarded for some garbage bowling.  I'll take it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India will still win this, I believe!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lovely bowling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3 in a row and the 4th one he tries something different. Not necessary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Afghanistan playing well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lol Kohli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bring on Kukdeep ffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TestingRhymes @sdayanand US Hotstar for $19.99 allows for 2 simultaneous viewings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>224 should be a defendable score for this bowling attack. So far outside of Shami and Bumrah, no one's got the memo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stitch a few dot balls guys!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Filthy bowling from India.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just give the trophy to New Zealand and get on with life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pandya with more rubbish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3 crap deliveries from Chahal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rahmat has very good technique.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Short balls are bread and butter for Taylor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cricketingview üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbennyman May you put in a Kohli-esque performance!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was coming from ball one. Took 7 overs though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Panicking in 3...2...1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Up*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pitch it to lads.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dilippoduval Yeah haha, in fact, Rahmat was underused.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whatever the outcome, this has been a great spell of fast bowling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All going Afghanistan's way. Great bowling but India though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dilippoduval Haven't been in ages now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shami's line and lengths are superb here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ooh Aleem strikes again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks out...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shami in great rhythm. Sanju Manju, not so much. :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#EarlyCall here. India to win by around 50-60 runs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get Taylor out and #WI almost have the game in their grasp. Equal to #Kohli in terms of innings building quality in the last few years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think Kohli and Rahul were the only wickets that had nothing to do with the wicket as such.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bumrah jee with a decent opening spell with 1-2 wickets should be handy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well bowled, Afghanistan. Played the pitch like it should be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chalo declare and time to skittle #Afghanistan out. India to win by 50-60 here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kuldeep with the Lara-esque high backlift and flourish. Hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having shat all over Jadhav's innings, I thank him for getting India to a winning total.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This should be a routine win for India....üëÄ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pandya struggling to time it too. Need to see how Afghanistan fare before passing final verdict on the pitch but it looks super slow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OK 2 overs, another 17. Come on India!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Jadhav bowls here, the delivery will reach the batsman in the next world cup. Slow AF kinda wicket.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok we got 1 and almost lost a wicket. I don't even.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well bowled, Rashid. Waiting for Iceland cricket to tweet something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently, he's plugged it back in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rashid pulled the plugs on Jadhav's life support there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Evin Lewis is gone off limping. Damn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jeez louis man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Munro gone too. More of walking wicket than Afridi. That takes some doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lol. As I finish this tweet in frustration, he hits a six. Still doesn't convince me. Bases his game on too many risk get-out shots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This guy can't play spin or fast bowling. For a nation with so much riches, is this the best we can do? #Jadhav<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only 1 Rashid over remaining, get 8 maybe without a wicket. Cash in on the rest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5 overs. Let's get 40 boys!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get in Windies. If India do lose, it'd help if NZ lose as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope Pandya does something here. Come on lad!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's OK, I think given how the pitch has been playing, another 25-30, and we should be home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indian crowd booing. Fuck off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the Bleep cricket was that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can Pandya and Vijay morph into spin bowlers?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God, India are shite against decent spin bowling. Pace? Oh yeah we will have all of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a totally different wicket to the one England played Afghanistan in. After a game like that, you'd expect Afghanistan to bounce back and that's all they are doing right now. Credit where credit is due.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gauravsabnis  https://t.co/ZF2P4K9WxX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India have proper tailenders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbennyman üòÇüëå<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Windies' best chance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somewhere Dada is fuming at Kedar Yadav.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Change that to 230.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Shaam tak khelenge" - Dhoni<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SRK impression gets me every time haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HomerOpines Quiet you :p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Need that 250. We will do well to get there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Permission to panic?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is that a deep batting line-up, Rameez?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>250-260 should secure the win for India. 300+ will give us more comfort and probably a larger margin of win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Doesn't even take much time to give it out. Almost always correct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well played, Shankar. Played his role in a partnership with Kohli. Needs to rotate strike better in the future. Job done for the day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank god for that short ball. Bread and butter for most, especially Kohli.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's not reading Rashid too well here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shankar doing alright, needs to rotate strike better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Played, Kohli. Captain, Leader, Brash boy, walking-brand. Whatever. Oh yeah, legend too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should have gotten at least 4 more from that over. Shite from Rashid continues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shite review klaxxon. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, 2011. I'll take some of that. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This over-rate though! #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should be enough on this wicket with our attack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's get to 250 now. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The path to wickets is dot balls. No matter what talent you got. kohli, Sachin, Ponting -- it doesn't matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Less said about that shot the better. Lol. Anyway, good luck Shankar!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That shot was as daft as Moeen Ali's shot yesterday. Pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rahul can hang in and play till 30 overs. I don't think there's any pressure on him to score rapidly here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>10 overs for 41-1, I'll take that any day against any side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a glorious drive. Kohli gonna run the twos out of this innings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kohli getting into the groove here. Hope for a 300+ score. I suspect we will get around 280.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab Noiceeee. Enjoy!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rohit fell 199 short. Just miss-u.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Truth be told, this middle order is super thin. Kohli wicket now and there will be proper butterflies. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good ball that. One more wicket and we can test that middle order...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zonal_Marking Ah, gotcha. No worries. Michael. Thanks for the info and looking forward to it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5.28 AM. Let's go #India! Come on lads! #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zonal_Marking Looks like I am out of luck here in Michigan.  https://t.co/Bil1pd9bxf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab Haha funny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheTweetOfGod Is God.....English?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab Loool guilty!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Srilanka's win today is another shot in the arm of teams outside the "Top 3". Great win for them today. Hope they build on this (except maybe against India hehe). #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>KP in good humor hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing unites cricket twitter like England losing. Loool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally, this tournament is alive. About damn time! #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IPL mention. DRINK!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First upset of the tournament and what a big one! Mad respect Sri Lanka. Asia reppin done right! #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbennyman It hurts, true, but just giving him due credit :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Malinga proper legend stuff today. IPL final and now this. Mad props!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sri Lanka! Get in!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Archer has a tweet for every situation in life. (And in cricket). hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vitu_E Bad son not responding to Mum in nearly 7 hours!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get Slinga Malinga in and wrap this tail up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ANOTHER ONE! Rashid gone~~!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something told me that Sri Lanka might pull this off or cause trouble for England. Not over yet but I would like to slowly start patting myself on the back. üëÄüëÄ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YES! Woakes gone now! GET IN LANKA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moeen bhai with a daft shot!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zonal_Marking Hi Michael, when will the audiobook of Zonal Marking be available on Audible?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is excellent from #SriLanka. #Malinga having a proper throwback here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Buttler at 6 and #Moeen at 7 is incredible depth. Woakes at 8 is a proper batsman too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on #Srilanka, win a damn game!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shame #England are going to fall well short of 500 today. #cwc19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There goes the point of #Yoga....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Torres vs Barcelona. That's all. Thank you #ElNino! #CFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Uruguay hound the referee like #Chelsea under #JohnTerry :P Didn't think that was a penalty though. #CopaAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great effort by #Bangladesh today. They play a fearless brand of cricket, kinda like Ganguly's #India. They are obviously doing something right at the grassroots level. Long may that continue. Cricket needs more than just the "Top 3" to be healthy and competitive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Australia slowly but surely getting into form in a cricket world cup has to be the most given thing.  They may seem like they can't compete prior to a world event (though not in the ongoing WC), but somehow they will be there or thereabouts among the favorites. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Make up your mind man!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maxrushden They were anything but unlucky, Max. They were their own undoing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@prakrules üòÇüòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If it's in the ar---fuck off!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is the point of de Kock? #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a throwback of a cricket game going on. Love it. #NZvSA #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Crownish There was an edit of him celebrating animatedly. Almost seemed like he was doing it over the top knowing the cameras were on him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Crownish üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dilippoduval üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India's #Drake #cwc19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab And then lose to India! üôÉ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy Cow! Morgan! #ENG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First proper chase of the tournament.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolute drubbing for Windies today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo I hope this doesn't turn into a Delhi Daredevils 2012 IPL type of situation for India. This format doesn't really care how you reach the knockouts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sanju Manju can't control his delight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good innings by Imad. Some consolation for Pakistan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Customary no-ball from Bumrah.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a shit passage of play.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pak should play out these 5 overs without losing a wicket and target around 30-40 runs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#USWNT üíØüíØ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pakistan need 130 from 1 ball.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbennyman Seriously. That was the least expected outcome at that time due to Yuvi's form. Boy we rallied.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aha_irshi True. But Yuvraj was more influential in the QF.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, Raina's innings won us that 2011 semi.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This just in: India-Pakistan is no longer a rivalry. #IndiaVsPakistan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sidvee HAHAHA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbennyman Seriously! I don't think he's bad tbh, just need better delivery.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lala with accurate summary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gautam Gambhir, at least give an impression of an analysis or opinion man. It sounds as if you are reading off a teleprompter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adiratan That's a good point. We should definitely rest them against Afghanistan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Truth!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India has had more trouble with injuries than troubled by any of their opposition so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shankar McGrath and Courtney Pandya doing it for India.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good toss to lose for India. We would have definitely bowled as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbennyman Yeah, same, which makes me sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbennyman Pakistan can still beat us in the final in this tournament, no matter how remote that may be. But if we played bilateral cricket with them, it'd be consistently one-sided.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India-Pak being a one-sider is hardly a surprise. 2017 defeat to #Pak was an anomaly which also happened to be a final. Another routine win here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is this short bowling dude!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Feel bad for Malik.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jk, that was a proper fast ball.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS DIBBLY DOBBLY NONSENSE WORKS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>7-0 coming up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He read it! Professor playing shots for which he should be sued.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pandya, naaye. Be calm and do your task da.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is going very well then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kullyyyyyy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last seen in Cuba after Miami.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GET IN KULLY! YOu deserve that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should have reviewed, should have stayed on and waited till umpire gives you out. Blah blah blah. That's the game man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shot yaar. Sounded nice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good bowling but good batting too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spin it to win it I guess for India. Nice from Kuldeep so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What bowling yaar Kully. What flight!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was hilarious hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fielding yaar!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could use a #Pak gift right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time for Chahal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What dibbly dobbly nonsense is this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Concerned!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bhuvi's absence opens the door for #Pak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seckyooooooooooooooooooooooore #Instarem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India's biggest trick is getting Jaddu on the field. Lol!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India's spinners will us this game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So circumspect against part-timers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, Pakistan should be going after these 2 guys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pakistan's #Kohli looking in fine form.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Average spell from Bumrah so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shankar McGrath<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck me. This is not good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shot! Imam looks very elegant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have a Hardik, they have a Fakhar. What times!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gambhir always talks as if is either leaving to a funeral or coming from a funeral.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>340?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Weird innings from Hardik.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Played, Kohli. Another 50. More routine than me brushing my teeth before bed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hardik Pandya not middling it but getting the runs. How aboooot that eh!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amir going to be tough to put away with the new ball.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shot from Kohli.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only Rohit can make a sublime 140 and leave me and many frustrated Lol. Thanks to his 200s in ODIs, we expect greatness day in day out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dude, compliment that fielding effort, Sanjay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously though, that shot was not the ask of the moment. Hasan was short of confidence and could have capitalized.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rohit left another 60-70 runs there. Good innings though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kohli.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Routine from Rohit. Keep going buddy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shades of Sehwag '03 that shot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good innings by Rahul, I'll take it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That too in a sport where they can add tremendous value.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sarfaraz: "Big shot coming lads"   Rahul: If you say so!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was coming from Rahul. Solid innings. Go on to make it a big one now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That over was more like it. Very unlike in the past 30 mins not able to rotate strike more freely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rahul getting bogged down a bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rohit plays it so late, that cut was so late. Nice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rahul playing like his namesake here. Solid defensive technique.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rohit vs Boredom is going to be a good contest here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rohit ji in full flow is something else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ROHIT SHARMA GET IN!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's more like it Rohit hahahaha love it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That sat up for a nice six. Gotta get after Shadab.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pathetic running tbh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rootofall3vil Love it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cut shot mmmmm. #Rohit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank fuck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok Wahab also on the shit bowling wagon so far. Good for India.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only threat is Amir at the moment. Play him out if need be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rohit pull shot klaxxon! #IndiaVsPakistan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>11.3 M after 5.5 overs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Naveenujja Yup!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbennyman Yeah, that is insane really!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India playing well so far. Not much swing there for Amir.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbennyman I am accessing US Hotstar so I am guessing this is regional?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>9.3M after 3 overs. #IndiaVsPakistan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India to win this by 45-60 runs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4.6M on #Hotstar before the first ball was bowled today. #IndiaVsPakistan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India vs Pakistan, lets go! #IndiaVsPakistan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sharan_L @The_Sarcastic_J @kashhrz @ShantanuYadav HAHAHAHA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbennyman üòÇüòÇüòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good fight by #Pak but too many stupid shots to boundary balls. There's your summary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maxrushden Haha, that's good for her given Australia are most probably gonna have a tough summer in WC + Ashes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maxrushden Bet the missus is happy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was coming. Starc pushed him back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quality knock.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The way Wahab looked back immediately told me he knew he nicked it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pak's game this, one free over left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pak have one more surprise up their sleeve in this game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hassan could have hung around there. But hey, number 8s can't bat bs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bounce and gone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Redemption.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another one bites the dust.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan Seriously. That's just pathetic batting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. How do you get out to that man?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo For real. I thought Aus couldn't be as bad as Pak but turns out they are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3 proper fluke wickets for Australia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbennyman Hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This should be a cakewalk for #Pak here...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Niceee haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hafeez treating Maxwell as he should be treated. Can't let the 5th bowler bowl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't deal with the stupidity of this statement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sardesairajdeep @babarazam258 @imVkohli What is the need to tag both of them here? You could have made the same point without tagging them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, why go for that pull?! So against the run of play!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some glorious shots, some pathetic bowling. Innings so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Babar, uff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan True, true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan Indeed! You think Pak will be able to chase this down? I am favoring Aus atm, cause they'll know what lengths to bowl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan Serious bowling happened!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent from #Amir. Woeful from #Aus. I think #Aus have enough on this pitch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a #Watson review.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gauravsabnis Niceeeee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yup, another one down. #Khawaja gone. #Amir strikes again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #Pak fielded even slightly better, #Aus would have been in trouble here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel bad for #Khawaja. #Aus haven't defined his role clearly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a proper choke by #Pak now. 350 looks distant with Amir overs left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Asif Ali can't catch a flu at this rate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well played, Warner. Proper comeback after that last game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What an ugly sho that was! #Maxwell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan That wicket helps big time. 350 is still on I'd imagine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Maxwell playing well. Pak need to bring their pacers on to get him out. Can't wait for him to make a mistake against spin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surprised #Aus didn't send Khawaja in...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave. In the name of the Father, I charge you to be just. In the name of the mother, I charge you to defend the innocent. Arise, Warner of Paddington, a knight of the Seven Kingdoms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Wasim and #Waqar. Can they bowl here, please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fast bowling treat from #Amir here. Warner playing well to see him off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Despite #Amir, Pak have conceded at 6.60 rpo. He only has 4 out of 25 overs left. 350 should be a cruise from here for Australia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Soary #Raptors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@svershbow @lindaholmes @erinmorgenstern @DavidGrann @sarahpekkanen @greerkh @amortowles @MeghanWeir I have starred way too many book recommendations. Time to pick one and run with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Retributions He doesn't separate Manjrekar, the fan vs Manjrekar, the commentator. He wears both hats at the same time which isn't on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#VirgilVanDijk Balon d'or claim. #UEFANationsLeague<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gauravsabnis Perhaps, yeah.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gauravsabnis In the HBO podcast, the writer brings this up. He said that going for a Russian (Ukranian) accent might stray away the seriousness of the events.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kohli will surely block Manjrekar on Twitter after this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Manjrekar goes back to the dressing room and hi-fives everyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dhawan is like wtf at Sanju Manju's dumb questions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice, comprehensive win over #AUS here. Love it! Batting, Bowling, fielding --- outplayed them in all departments here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's another run saved. #NRRWatch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Death bowling maestro here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dhoniiii, stop pannunga thala<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's DLS par :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well played Carey! Thanks to Aus team management for their decisions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India defending par score in style. ‚ô•Ô∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Carey on, carey on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chak de India time. let's gooooo boooyssss! #IndiavsAustralia #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yesss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Carey is on fire here. Uff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bumrah and Bhuvi to finish it from here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bumrah, wrap this up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TwitterCricket when #India does well is hands down the best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a catch! That's game! Start the celebrations!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cricketcouch @sdayanand Plus it seemed as if he edged it in first look.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YESSSSSSSSSSSSS BHUVIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII GET INNNNNNNNNN comeback yaar!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That looked out on first look. Good review by India.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YESSSSS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor over from Bhuvi. Not bowling to the field.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2 effortless strokes from Maxwell. This guy makes it look easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, they've had their handbrakes on for the entire chase.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bumrah does it again. Nice little choke on their chase.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Soccer from MS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spinners doing it for India.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@im_naveenprasad @HomerOpines @Aniketkibe 13.1M in during India's final batting over is what I have it at.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Super from Chahal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rahul, shabash. Lovely boundary-riding from him today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tifosiguy Yeah, it's been quite poor. Can't keep up with the intensity of the game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tifosiguy I got that impression too hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TestingRhymes Niceee right back at you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dada speaks, Kohli and Chahal deliver!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YESSSSS!!!!! COME ONNN!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rahul saved 4 runs in that over. More poor bowling from India.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is an absolute shitshow of an over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's get through some over quick overs here. Jaddu would have been handy here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bad over from Kuldeep so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3 more overs and we will have a result.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbennyman Absolutely. What a time that was!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahhhh Yuvi! 2011! üòÑ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gauravsabnis It's like a #Westworld host clone out there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sdayanand HAHAHAHA. Almost spat my coffee out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TestingRhymes Tbh, this was sent out during Kuldeep's over haha but I'll take it! :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was coming, get in!!!! Fielding spot on from India here!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright boys, time for wicket number 1. I'll take it in this over, thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pandya taken to the cleaners here. Expected I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pandya clocking at 85MPH in that over. Niceee!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sheeekar Dhawan should a thigh-five from the dressing room.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn, that's 1 clear bowled not going India's way and a clear run out chance missed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love the alertness of the fielders in the ring. Kinda their job but nice to see anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know the commentary is bad when you hope either Rameez or L Siva might come in and rescue the day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The tournament happens once in a year. Get it right the first time, dumbasses!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tight stuff from India.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, if there is any swing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get one to swing into Finch. That'll do him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, who did the failure mode analysis for these bails?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abhility Niceeee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolute disgrace to the game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck these bails man!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbennyman Hahaha that was literally me moments ago :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice icing on the cake by Rahul towards the end. Couple of enjoyable shots! :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did #SanjuManju just say middle east?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bumrah, give us 1 wicket in this spell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Hotstar hit 13.1M in their viewer count and their stream didn't collapse. #Ripleys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EyeOnThePitch For reals!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I mean, Maxwell turned the ball.  Chahal and Kuldeep will be the difference<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hardik Pandya at 4 worked like a charm. Even if he had gotten out first ball, that strategy showed this team knows to adapt and do it quickly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's quite insane, really. A team made for the big moments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing can help soothe the pain of '03 final but this batting performance chips away at it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Par score but I have India winning. Aus to score close to 320. Spinners should be the difference here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rahul yaar, shabash.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, that's a poor over from India pov.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dude, get out of here! Shot of the series!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brilliant, Pandya. Another 50 from 5 and we good here!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shot yaar!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GOAT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's more like it boy. Starc or Cummins, ain't no thang!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dei, Kohli. Come on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>70 in 6?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What fielding! Uff!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>10M on #Hotstar alert.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Straight, man! Batting yaar!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>21 off 2. Nice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shot, Kohli!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Life eh!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ooooweeee, drop!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hardik, light it up boy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Super innings!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uff shot of the day from Sheeekar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's proven: Kohli reads my tweet in between deliveries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright, lads, let's step it up here! #India<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Magic Moments from 2003. Still remember Zak starting off with that wide. Knew it was downhill from there. #History #WorldCup2003<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SHEEEEEKAR Dhawan! Get in you thigh-slapping hero!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tifosiguy For real. So crass. When you hit rock bottom in your creative department. Lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Keep throwing it outside off against Kohli, he's gonna smack you Aussies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok double-score-30overs-time. 340 eh. #INDvAUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo I gotcha. Thanks for that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Wait, really?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Haha yes yes, as it often happens when you bring up a positive stat about a player :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Coulter-Nile getting extra bounce off length. Hello, Bumrah.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Deiiiiii. OK well played, Rohit! Enter #Kohli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sdayanand Ouch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Fair enough. Hope you are right!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is an incredible stat!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Yeah, you are probably right, but I was considering the lack of power-hitting in the lower order (only Pandya). But if these 2 stay for another 10 overs, then I guess 350+ is on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rohit in #godmode. Excellent form and incredible maturity!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nathan Coulter-Nile, Stoinis, Zampa, Maxwell -- Indian batsmen in the dressing room should be licking their lips.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is an excellent start. 330 from here on, I'd imagine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sheeekar Dhawan. Well played!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rohit Sharma and pull shots. Rinse and repeat!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Top of off from 'Jofreee' Archer (according to Dada).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#England batting returns to normal service. That was hella entertaining! #ENGvBAN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great to see #Netherlands back and playing super football. France, Germany and now England.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, it's not coming home. #ENGNED #UEFANationsLeague<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>oh again hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Loooooooooll<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Would have been a direct hit too hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shit cricket from #BD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh Mushfiqur Looool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok Bangladesh, #showmewhatyougot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rohit's innings was sheer class. Did the job alright. No glamor, nothing. Sheer focus and grit. Love such innings!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright, WC trophy, here we come! #TeamIndia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Almost there, campaign off to a good start. Forget the opposition and play your best. We got this. #TeamIndia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab I'm a glass half-full kinda guy so I like to be positive. I think we did more than okay here, I would be very confident after this performance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rohit, what an innings. Paced to perfection. This entire chase has been near-perfect for India.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was coming. Rabada on fire. Now against Kohli, proper contest this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chahal!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice move to bring Bumrah here for maybe a couple of overs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab Fair enough but I think by the time we reach semis/finals, we will be much better adapted to the conditions. We will see. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbennyman üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbennyman Pakistan beating England has given me renewed confidence in India's chances. Aus is there for the taking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbennyman It's happening! 8 years on, the WC is coming home, Mr. Benny!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab I feel very confident tbh. I think we got this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab Just being a bit over the top (brave), let me be! :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India gonna win this #CWC19 easily.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wickuts, wickuts and more wickuts. Love it! #India have arrived. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What. An. Over. Beauty!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's wrap this up lads! #india<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chahal to du Plessis had a wicket written all over it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I mean, Bumrah delivered us a fuckig series win in Australia, so this is the pretty routine for him and for India. Love it though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RInse repeat. Slip catching on point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bumrah does what Bumrah does. Best bowler in the world!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First game. Let's bring it home, boys! #india #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab Haha true!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India could have squeezed another #IPL in by the time their first game rolls out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pakistan 2 short of par score. Good effort though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Athar trying hard to make this seem like an upset win for Bangladesh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another routine win for #Bangladesh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Fizz has been quite good today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The UK is hands down the best place to hold a world sporting event. You get fans for every team thanks to its multicultural nature. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got to take the game deep, son. You'll learn. #SAvBAN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally a close game in this #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally they catch Miller. That's that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Bangladesh starting to bottle it in the field.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Miller goes, this is BD's game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bangladesh with some stunning batting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bangladesh setting the standard for Asian teams so far with their batting. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best video ever. Right in the feels!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spurs being Spursy. Love it. Huge shoutout to #Klopp, the man's a rockstar!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelissaReddy_ Congrats, Melissa!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#KTBFFH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Origi Story! #LFC #UEFAChampionsLeague<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hotstartweets Sort your glitchy app. Can't stream anything properly. I cannot believe I am paying $20 for this crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ready for some #Warner fireworks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What hitting, a little more application and 260 was on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stupid batting by Afghanistan, really.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Liverpool, please win today. Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Steve Smith, you beauty!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another 1-sided world cup game coming up. Afghanistan's best chance was chasing a score.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently Wahab Riaz was brought back in for his batting. Always trust in Inzi.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan Bro, batting collapse or part of a larger trend?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Truth. Even Brathwaite a part-timer can generate pace and the ball comes at chest height.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sir Viv! üôè<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sdayanand Oh ok, thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sdayanand Hi Sriram, do you listen to #TMS on your phone?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now that I have said it, they will go on to win the whole damn thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pakistan have lost the plot here. Pathetic batting. Short ball undoing them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can anyone help me? How can I get #TMS on my phone?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan England, India, Australia, West Indies. You?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some daft batting by #Pakistan and some proper short pitched bowling from #WestIndies #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>England looking hella strong. Love their jersey too. #CWC19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>COME ON!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you #Hazard. Thank you, @ChelseaFC! #EuropaLeagueChampions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Euron Grey Joy as Leeds hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's bring it home!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only redeeming thing to come out of season 8 is Djawadi's score. Brilliant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GameOfThronesFinale is here. Still remember watching the first episode eons ago in India. The last show to get bums on seats at the same time en masse. Great story, disappointing end (season 8).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another great #IPL comes to an end. Not the result I wanted but definitely enjoyable. Time to pause and come back for #WorldCup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Without doubt. More than the 3 titles he won with #CSK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#IPL is #Dhoni. #CSK is #Dhoni. Indian cricket is #Dhoni.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dhoni summarized it well. A mediocre team that punched above its weight and reached the final and almost pulled it off. Bowling great; batting, not good enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HAHAHAHA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#IPL without #Dhoni....man that's hard to imagine. Even though it's very, very close.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish 'hope' was a graph-able metric. Mine would have been all over the place through the course of that game. Would have peaked at 9 off 6.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a big game player! Quality innings from #Watson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Longest Without Going To The Bathroom Award for me, please! #IPL2019 I will share it with @HomerOpines!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brilliant. I can't get enough of this. Shows that it's just a game. And at what a time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyway, #WorldCup soon. Bring it home lads! All of you! Mumbai ho ya Chennai!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BloodyNRI Just had a close defeat, I am allowed to be philosophical. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HomerOpines Hehehe, for real. I was gone. Couldn't deal! üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bowling wins tournaments. But you need a modicum of support from batting too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats @HomerOpines! Staunch #MI fan if there ever was one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sheer class from the dude!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyhoo, the age old cliche. Defeats make the victories sweeter. Hope #CSK come back again next season and do this again! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Part of watching sport is losing. Losing in finals, losing in the first game. Can't be entitled to anything. #CSK could go on a streak missing out on playoffs. For 11 years, that didn't happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Proud of the #CSK effort. Yet another campaign to be proud of. Lots of batting failures but constantly punched above weight to make it to the finals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No point in going about ifs and buts, this is peak T20 cricket. Close games are what its all about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sunday ruined. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Losing close games sucks, but on form, this defeat flatters #CSK. #MI were always better on paper.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats @ImRo45. Quality leader!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MI deserved it. Well played; #Bumrah has been a class apart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely gutted and feeling real low right now. #CSK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congratulations Mumbai :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>15.7M on #Hotstar enjoying this game. Love it! Also, Bumrah. Uff man!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Chahars have been amazing today!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MI 's game to lose from here on. Massive bottle job required from #MI to lose this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bumrah will take the best players out. Ambati Rayudu, didn't have a chance did he?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ImRaina Thanks for your services to #CSK. If you have any pride left, please retire now at the end of this season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dhoni backing Raina has to be biggest and most powerful lobby in Indian cricket.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congratulations @ManCity. Congratulations @LFC. You guys gave us a stunning season!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>150 to win in a final? Mumbai's game to lose from here on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glen Murray to have his "Aguerooooooo" moment tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glenn Murray to have his "Aguerroooooooooooo" moment? Love me some drama!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Final day of #PremierLeague + #IPLFinal2019 means have to choose games wisely: #CFC, #LFC and #CSKvsMI it is!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbennyman Congratulations! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well done to @mipaltan on their 4th IPL title! #EarlyCall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go on #Brighton!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last day of #PremierLeague. Let's sign off with a win, @ChelseaFC!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@svershbow As I always tell myself in tough times, this too shall pass (Unless you are Steph Curry in which case you take the shot...OK ignore the tangent). Jokes aside, good on ye!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am all for my future wife to make wayyyyy more than I do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't think that's a red. Harsh! #Sunderland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RIP those opponents Loool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan @TheRealPCB Nevermind haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan @TheRealPCB What about Aamer Yamin?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well played, #Pakistan. England, #Archer still going to affect team culture...or?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bring on #SunderlandvsPortsmouth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Derby robbed there. BS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on #Pakistan, don't mess this up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Penalty! Yes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG #Derby, how do you miss that!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Completely with @jonathanliew on this one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The loaded language behind questions over Archer's effect on England  https://t.co/H0jDNgudvb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is so true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on #Derby, let's do this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Penalty miss! #Dortmund<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry #hitz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#burki costing #Dortmund dearly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get in #Dortmund!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan Hahaha :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan Yeah, true. You think you guys have the batting to chase this down?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan Yeah, probably the only favorites going into the world cup. Pakistan looked pretty bad today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan They need #Archer and that would complete their side. As of now, their bowling isn't great. Capable of conceding 350 themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"These Pakistani bowlers don't know how to mankad, call Ashwin now on WhatsApp" -- my dad üòÇüòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Incredible batting but becoming fairly routine with #England and specifically Butler these days. 350 is the new 300 for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Butler doing #Butler things. Becoming as routine as #kohli scoring hundreds. #ENGvPAK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AstonVilla have turned things around! #TammyAbraham with the potential winner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@warriors home and dry now....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#StephCurry turning it up right now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klay Thompson is insane! #Warriors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#chelsea are going to the US 4 days before #EuropaLeague final. What in the flying fuck!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't toy with us this way, Hazard. In my mind, you are already off. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eintracht Go on and mess #Bayern up! Great game!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GET THE FUCK IN #Chelsea! Love a good shootout win! #CFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Ramos should try his #panenka against #Kepa üëÄ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#azpilicueta our leader, our legend! #KTBFFH #CFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#kepa with a super game. Some stunning saves. And a solid showing in the shootout. #CFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whatever it takes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Props to #Frankfurt. #Chelsea were pushed and made to scrape through.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shit game but fuck if I care. David Luiz redeemed himself with that off the line and that penalty. #KTBFFH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Believe. Believe. Believe. Believe. Believe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More symmetry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>7 years later, an #English club will win the #ChampionsLeague after utter dominance by #Spain in between.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hate to say it, but I feel like it's written in the stars for #Spurs this season. They have literally been saying #NotToday since the group stages. #championsleague<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2 nights back to back of intense drama. Acche din for English football.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is always a symmetry if you look hard enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cricketingview @gauravsabnis Ah, I see. Interesting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cricketingview @gauravsabnis Question to you both: Isn't all knowing subjective?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cricketingview @gauravsabnis I think so, yeah. Marketing is a catalyst to an already existing bias in us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cricketingview It is fascinating. Picking a side and rooting for said side comes to us humans as inherently as breathing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahaha so true. Jonathan's is usually the first report I read mainly because it's one of the earliest match reports out there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was me after #Chelsea beat #Barcelona in 2012. üòì<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only sports has the capability of creating euphoria and pain of the same magnitude.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely hate #Spurs from the bottom of my heart but #Poch in tears there hit me hard. What raw emotion! This game is beautiful. Makes us all feel alive! #SapTrain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PLEASE FUCK SPURS UP!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonathanliew with some stellar writing.   An Anfield miracle transcribed from the pages of pure fantasy  https://t.co/iKdFKw2LPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Origi's hold up play was Drogba levels. Insane stuff for a guy who barely starts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jordi Alba had his worst Barca game, I think. Messi wasn't far behind. Went missing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am lucky enough to have seen this Liverpool play live, albeit in a pre-season friendly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Liverpool played like a team that will most likely end up with 97 points in the league. The high press was from Dortmund of past and Liverpool of last year. To do that against Barca over 95 mins? Modern miracle!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cricketingview - pretty much what you said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Multi-ball practice coming in clutch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HomerOpines This comment hasn't aged well at all üòÇüòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How's that for failing beautifully?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How are my United fans feeling? Hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cesc with a pearl!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Liverpool, I hate you. But man, this is inspirational!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WHAT THE FUCK DID I JUST WATCH. WHAT DID WE ALL JUST WATCH! FUCK ME!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SURELY NOT! WOW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"A very small man can cast a very large shadow." - Varys; Tyrion for the Iron Throne confirmed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Barca could have rested #Messi for this game too. Should be a walk in the park tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sanjaymanjrekar But your pom-poms!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HomerOpines @highonsport Third match is over. You are living in the past too! See, your logic is equally flawed. üòá<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gotta do a Sansa here and be heroic in looking at the truth: #MI miles ahead of #CSK this season. Well played today! @mipaltan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HomerOpines Alright, alright. You won, you talk! That's fair. It's not over yet though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The greatest Indian cricketer ever. #MSDhoni<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tough game for #CSK. Just need to look at the way Liverpool have believed in themselves and keep going at it till we are actually out. Come on #CSK! #Believe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jaddu, what a rockstar!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I sure hope not, in the interest of an evenly contested final.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HomerOpines :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tahir with his "Afridi" speeds cannot bowl leg side. Even Tahir the batsman can put these away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Crownish Absolutely hahaha fuck all is happening right for CSK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lol fuck off with this fielding man. Bc what are you guys doing. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nevermind.....Lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This should have happened with them at 75 or 85<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kartikmurali made a good point about running hard on this wicket. These 2 have done just that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bad*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dhoni's "nah, nah, nah" there sums up #CSK 's day really. Bat with the bat, toothless with the ball on a pitch offering assistance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can't have Imran in the ring and expect to stop a single lol. Sadly, can't hide him anywhere on the ground.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seri free. This game is done. On to qualifier 2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why not being mid-on or mid-off up and try something new?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This game is as dead as Hitler. #IPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MI bowling today was on point. #CSK already lagging behind in their strongest aspect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice rotation of strike by these 2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally, good fielding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Tahir doesn't get 2 wickes in his first 2 overs, indha game sure a gaali.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sanjaymanjrekar Mate, you dropped your pom-poms!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dude, bring Tahir man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BC retirement uncles are fielding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Frankly, this has been a shit start from #CSK on this wicket.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Siva and Sanju Manju -- 2 biggest cheerleaders when their teams play.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ishan won that battle. Cojones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Luck going #MI 's way. Can't say they haven't deserved it but frustrating from a #CSK pov.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chahar got 1 over too many there. Bring on Imran or Jaddu man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vijay comes in 2 matches and drops 2 fairly straightforward catches. Watson in his retirement age would have done better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Immy Bhai deserves 2 parcels of biriyani with boiled egg for that fielding attempt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vijay Lol. Doofus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pathetic from Chahar. Dude. WTF.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pandya will come in at some point and hit 3 sixes in a row or some shit like that and finish this. This tweet is going to age well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atlasdanced Ishan Kishan too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stupid wicket in the first over is giving me hopes. Damn you hope! #CSK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Harbhajan should do better than that with his experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, bring the subs on. #CSK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saw the knuckle ball coming from a mile away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chahar doing what Chahar does. Quality bowler on useless wickets for pacers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Open with Harbhajan and Jadeja. Lol. #CSK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Slow wicket yada yada, Mumbai will win this fairly easily.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bumrah with clutch yorkers! As usual.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bumrah's no-ball already cost us a ICC Trophy. Please quit this habit man. Dope yorkers though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When CSK start bowling, all deliveries should be ONLY slow balls from pacers. Zero pace should be given on this wicket.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Move over @imVkohli. India needs a new captain and @ImRo45 is here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rayudu can't run, can't field, and attempts to run partner out. Thank goodness, he's not going to WC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When your batting is as bad as it has been this season, why bat first?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Worst pitch in #IPL this year. Pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyway, all teams have a ceiling. #CSK have punched above their weight reaching playoffs. On to the next season we go! #MI 's IPL to lose from here on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is a #Watson? No, really.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's save the embarrassment of 4 defeats against #MI. At least have a half decent final. #CSK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another routine defeat for #CSK against #MI then. Rivalry on paper; #CSK seem clueless against #MI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All in for this theory!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This had me in stitches üòÇüòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Team India contingent from all the franchises look in good form except for Jadhav and Shankar. #IPL2019 Hardik, more than just good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab It was a joke. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HomerOpines Hahaha, good one! Jokes aside though, we comin for ya üëÄ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HomerOpines You will be Cersei-ed in the finals! Or Thanos-ed! #YouPrefer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HomerOpines Meme game strong, sir. Hahaha; ya'll get gonna Arya-ed on Tuesday though :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only 1 team has steadily improved over the season and that's #MI. Difficult to buck that trend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My prediction is that #MI will win #IPL2019; obviously, I hope I am wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Twitter MI or Twitter MU --- I think both are equally shitty. Lol. At least the latter has been silenced for a few years now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Keep Kohli away from this stat. He might get ideas for next season to aim for 12 points.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CSK definitely underdogs in this qualifier despite playing at home. Don't know what to make of Jadhav's absence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is the real benefit of finishing in top of the table? Top team becomes the "Home" team in Qualifier 1; anything else?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright, #MI, we meet again. #CSK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brighton you beauty!! THANK YOU!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on #Chelsea, please hold!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LUIZ!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CSK fan here, can concur. And #MI bowling first means against #kkr means, MI vs CSK qualifier probability went up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOFTUS FUCKING CHEEK! GET IN!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First, #CSK finish with a below-par score. Then, get carted around the park. Had me sweating there when #KingsXI threatened to get here in 14.3 overs. Top 2 guaranteed, Faf and Raina's batting are the only positives from this game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bring on #Spygate part II!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Benitez is class. Checking up on Salah.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Totally true about KKR. Though, wearing CSK blinkers, it was hard to appreciate then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Yeah, and that dive to complete to the single in the WC final, making his body into a U, mad respect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Fine, fine, fair enough. If there's such a thing as retracting what I said then I do. The guy has achieved a lot for India.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Let me enjoy my beer and hate on who I want, isn't that what Twitter is for? :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo I didn't even know that guy was running for elections. Lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Lol, you were the one who responded to my tweet man. You are the triggered one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Good for him. And apparently, good for you, since he's up your ass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo I don't give a titty fuck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo He's a chutiya man. I dislike him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Insane haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gotta give it to Lala here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The cutest clip I've seen this year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BloodyNRI For dicks like you bro!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope #HardikPandya hasn't peaked already! Hope he takes this form to the WC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CillizzaCNN I read this in Arrested Development narration voice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AvengersEndGame  -- 5 hours after. What a movie! There was so much happening. Stunning performances by all. Definitely requires at least 3-4 watches to get the full scope of this movie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best tweet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After the past few innings, I am glad Rayudu isn't going to the WC for India. Can't rotate the strike for shit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great. Miracle needed to win Europa.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HAHAHAHA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChelseaFC Here's our new manager. If not now, then in the near future for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yayyyyyy it's here!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know an ep of #GOT just ended when all the #trends are about something or the other from the episode.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GOT DAYUMMMMMMMMMMMM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Crownish Yeah, Thakur has been shit with the new ball.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank God, you decided to still play ODIs, mahi bhai, cause let's be real, I am a fuckall captain without you :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Crownish Yeah, Dhoni's long rope is the longest in all of sport, I think. Rayudu not able to freely rotate the strike at his position is a no-no for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Top 2 spots up for grabs now after CSK's 2 consecutive losses. IPL getting into win or perish mode for lower teams which opens up the table nicely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Faf and Jadhav's shots were inexcusable. Knowing when to take risk is equally important as taking the risk itself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CSK still top of the table due a 1-man batting side. Watson, Raina, Jadhav, Rayudu haven't really arrived yet.  Worry for CSK despite the position.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Play that Dhoni six on repeat at my funeral service.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Crownish True<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RCB must have had some serious deja vu after repeatedly getting battered by CSK and Dhoni specifically. Finally some fortune goes their way (No call on that no-ball).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kohli must be thanking his stars he has Dhoni with him during the WC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CSK, too. Can't be the most successful franchise on and off the field without a leader like Dhoni.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HomerOpines Sure, lets go with that :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The most influential and cerebral cricketer India has ever produced. IPL benefitted thanks to him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shardul was more about being Mankaded than running like a mad man towards the other end. Koi nahi, great game! #Thala Thala putting the exclamation point in IPL.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan @Janab_e_Ali Hope you lads are doing well!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan @Janab_e_Ali I am still not excited about the WC just yet, because the Aus series win was a real highpoint of 2018-19 for me. Gonna be hard to top that in terms of excitement of winning a series but that may change if India manage to reach later stages of WC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India. Pakistan. Chennai. 1999  https://t.co/T8vuLLzas3 via @cricketmonthly | @sidvee Excellent writing, Sid. 90s India cricket was a real rollercoaster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan @Janab_e_Ali Haha, touche. For a country that's not known for fast bowlers, I'll take 23.70 avg! As far as WC goes, I think you guys are favorites along with England. India are favorites on paper (almost always), but we are arguably weaker than the side that lost in '17 CT final.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's the D/L score for 1 wicket down at 20 overs? :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Khaleel Ahmed has no regard for any kinda 'stump' guard. Hahaha!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#chahal giving us a glimpse of how he will one day save a Test match by batting on day 5.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TestingRhymes When you have time to spare haha  https://t.co/RLIk8G9uc4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TestingRhymes for some reason*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TestingRhymes For real, all I can think of is Saudis in Audis parody for reason Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India on track for WASP score. Good on Chahal and Yadav.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fullyarbit @bennyman0 Haha he was good, wasn't he?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a dreamlike away season for India, ruled in Australia in Tests and ODIs. Then success against a stiffer challenge in NZ. Lots to be happy about. Set for WC, I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HomerOpines Thank you sir!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody give Yadav a sponsor, he's Lara in the making.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HomerOpines The tundra aka Michigan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>-13 and with wind chill, it feels like -34. Mental.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Janab_e_Ali @Nabeel_Chohan Lol how is this an apples to apples comparison when we have bowled almost double the number of overs as Pakistan? :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was a superb spell from Boult. Brilliant. This reminded me of the 2002-03 spell, where India struggled a lot. Nice little reminder for India to check for any complacencies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The yes-man riding his luck, Lol. The only blemish coming out of this tour is that Shastri will continue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan High-highs and low-lows bud, that's us cricket fans from the Indian sub-continent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perfectly captures my mood hahaha #SRKDoesItBest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan Nice try at trolling ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Much like Messi, Ronaldo, Federer, Nadal, whenever I see Kohli, either bat or conduct himself in general, he inspires me to constantly improve myself, to give that extra 10% in whatever I'm trying to do. Infectiously inspirational figure; Indian cricket is blessed to have him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kohli's a brilliant, well-spoken, sharp leader. Hope he has a future with Indian cricket even after his playing days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not even Michigan cold can put a downer on that. Bundled under the comforter, fist-pumping as Virat lifts the trophy. Fuck yeah, baby!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>COME ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let me type that out again: India have won a Test series in Australia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scratch that, this is better than 2011 WC win. Goosebumps! #India<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2-1 scoreline flatters #Australia. Robbed off a win thanks to rain. It's OK. I am sure we can win here again and soon at that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2019, from an Indian cricket fan's perspective, has already hit it's zenith for me; India winning the Test series is bigger than anything that India can do in the remainder of this year -- yep, that includes winning back the WC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Janab_e_Ali @Nabeel_Chohan Haha :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan I was riling you up man. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Throw in some recency bias and I think this ranks better than 2011 WC win. Well done India! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èAbsolutely fucking love it! Worth breaking my Twitter silence for this occasion!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India winning in England in '07, winning in NZ in '08-'09, winning in WI in '06 were the highlights until 2011 WC win came along, few series victories excited me since 2011, until this series. To see India beating Australia in Australia in my lifetime, on par with 2011 WC win :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As far as Chelsea are concerned, we are above schedule on our recovery. So far so very good. Just need to stop giving a shit about Europa league and make sure we finish in the top 4 come May.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chelsea-Liverpool was so entertaining, 1-1 a fair result. Like #Sarri said, Chelsea aren't way behind Liverpool. I still think City are favorites but this Liverpool has grit AND can score goals. That's a title winning combination.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan His economy is under 5 on batting paradises. His career would been dead if he were playing for Pakistan, good point because of how talent is consistently mismanaged by your inept selectors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For a tournament that I didn't really 'care', it definitely had me out of my seat. Good fightback by India managing to claim the title. Bangladesh easily the second best. Afghanistan third best with Pakistan, Sri Lanka in the same tier as you'd expect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan Good game against Bangladesh btw. Again, my point stands about the gap in quality. Light years behind India.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He makes Morata look like Ronaldo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab Yeah, haha, I remember when it used to be Thursday and Friday, and I was there when it changed to Friday and Saturday too . Old memories slipping! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab Oh no, I have spent 20 years in Kuwait, that's enough Middle East for a lifetime. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan Bumrah walks into any team, Bhuvi makes it to most teams; Umesh has turned a new leaf in ODIs. India's weakness is lack of batting exposure for middle order and 5th bowler. Also, why aren't Faheem Ashraf and Talat in the squad? Or have I been living under a rock?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab Haan, Final on Friday, I thought it was Sunday. Haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope India's middle order gets another trial against Pakistan/Bangladesh. Need to address that soon. Don't care as much about the outcome on Sunday, much like this entire tournament.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jadeja, a victory off a single is the same as victory of a six, mate. ü§®<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan My point still stands that the gulf in quality between these sides is vast. We even boast a better fast bowling unit (and reserves), and arguably, spin choices as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India's middle order problems prevail. Rahul and Rayudu had 100s for the taking. Should have seen Sharma, Dhawan yesterday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh looks like no super over. Well played, Afghanistan! 3 time's nearly the charm. What a tournament for them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Afghanistan deserved to win this, but despite their best efforts and umpires' best efforts, India have eked out a tie. Afghanistan favs by a country mile in the super over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, Afghanistan! Great effort. Little more experience and you guys could have finished this game easily. Well played!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which in turns leads to taking the spice out of India-Pakistan contests. Facing Pakistan and beating them used to be a big deal for India, not anymore. While for Pakistan, it continues to remain a monumental feat highlighting the gap in quality between these 2 sides.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which also gives way to one-sided India-Pak games like the ones in this tournament.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The champions trophy defeat was a blip. India has a solid base at the grassroots level for an assembly line of talent to come through and succeed. Can't say the same about Pakistan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now that the India-Pakistan Asia Cup tournament is comprehensively won by India, can we give the rest of the the guys in the squad a game in the dead rubber next Sunday? #AsiaCup2018<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When was the last time Pakistan started as favorites in an India-Pak game? Can't recall. Also, it's really hard to get excited for this tournament, nevermind the game. England tour has taken a toll on me. Having said that, let's go India!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>King Kohli putting opposition in place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bet this is Mou's way of saying fuck you to the glazers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brighton! Scenes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>168 lead. Awesome! Let's get another 150 to this and we should be good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India should go hell for leather and push the lead past 300 quickly. I think that will be enough for the win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's working. GET IN PANDYA! 5!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can we please wrap this up soon?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am going to be stupid and think this is because I ain't watching the game. I will continue to not watch the game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The lads are turning it on. Love it!! #India<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hardki 'Kapil Dev' Pandya rocking it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Aguero is insanely good. Consistently brilliant like #Messi. #City are looking ominous again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats, Max! @bglendenning better have a song ready for you! :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kovacic, greata debut. Hazard, another brilliant cameo for the guy who glides across the surface. I am liking this team despite it's troubles in the first half. #KTBFFH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on you blues! Please hold?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I say bring on Hazard and go for a 7-6 win. #Chelsea<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why haven't we declared yet? #India<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only #Azpi at RB gives me some confidence; Luiz-Rudiger center-back combo nothing; Alonso at LB nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well left!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This could have been 7-1 Brazil Germany. Chelsea need HT right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*He brought his defensive 'tactics' with him too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kepa would be regretting if season long this continues. Could have been 5-3 like in 2011, except in fucking 45 mins! WTF,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was coming. should have been 4-4 already. No defense playing tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great for a neutral but my goodness, no defending in this game!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was coming, this is Napoli defending. Carved open!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How many times has that Arsenal defensive line been broken? Incredible. shoulda been 3-0 ahead alrady!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ouch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan Yeah, I will feel better if we were number 1 and we beat teams away, until then, in my view at least, I'm not totally satisfied. Kudos to Pakistan, I called them out for their success against England in May, when the conditions are traditionally tougher for batsmen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lol! @Xoom coming in real handy with their great rates when the rupee gets a serious battering.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Facebook streaming La Liga in India is a brilliant win for them. Despite Ronaldo leaving, it's still a hugely popular league in India, second only to the Premier League.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been ages since I was in India for #IndependenceDay2018. Kinda miss it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan Haha, give me a break, which country travels well these days anyway? Give us shit for playing shite away, not for doing well at home. Not a fair assessment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ali Khan, for the USA, looks like a quality bowler. #CPL18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nabeel_Chohan Yeah, it's worrying. Maybe you guys could teach us how you managed to beat England earlier this year haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab Totally agreed. I feel burnt out following so much cricket, I can only imagine what the players are going through.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TestingRhymes @Granger_Gab Yeah, true. We should have an exchange program for pitch curators haha and use either Duke or Kookaburra throughout<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab Yeah, strange times. Wonder what the root cause is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmm. Cricket.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope the Indian team brushes this aside a minor blip rather than the unravelling of our players' temperament.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab I am saying the number 1 tag will carry even more weight (for me) if we start to win abroad. I want to move on to next frontier of dominating away and rubber-stamping our superiority wherever we play. A proper world beater of a side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TestingRhymes @Granger_Gab Agreed. Not dissing India's home wins as Minal seems to have misunderstood me here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab I think you have completely lost me; in saying India should win more away does not even remotely come close to dissing home wins. It's a statement about how I will be more confident in calling my team undisputed number one even if someone throws numbers at me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab Yup, it's my view that our number 1 title is justified but would mean more if we could win away as maybe even half of what we do in India.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab @HomerOpines Ha. I am talking about India here; don't want to get into a whataboutisms. One rule for all, simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab I know that. We are where we are on merit. It's not India's fault that they are touncing opposition at home and raking the points in; BUT, it would mean so much more, to me, if we started winning away too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HomerOpines @Granger_Gab Those who say that are wrong. Like I said, it's not given that a home should win at home; it's taken for granted which is wrong. But moving on from that, to me, world number 1 sounds hollow when we fail outside India.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab If*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab Nope, I didn't say that, I came across that way, then yeah I am wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab You are missing the point. It's not one rule for them one rule for us, my contention is that India, the number 1 test team, should be judged on away performances. The #1 ranking feels incomplete without away success.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab I don't care about other team's performances away. I care about the Indian team and the way it's perceived.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab I am not saying it should apply to India only. I am saying the way a team should be judged is how it fares outside of it's comfort zone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab England, Australia, South Africa.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab Not saying winning in subcontinent is a given; if we want to be recognized as world beaters, shouldn't we be winning away consistently? Only the Aus of early 2000s did that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Granger_Gab I know this is an age old debate, but deep down, can we really be convinced that we are the best team in the world when our performances have been quite awful outside of the subcontinent?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is there some ban against #Arsenal from shooting?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cricketingview The excuse that you have been making for England bowlers' success, and as an extension, India's batting failures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having said that, I hope the Indian team takes a day or two off from cricket, spends some time with their families., if around, just to clear their heads and start preparations afresh for the remaining Tests. A clear-headed approach can do some good for this team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cricketingview You have been going on and on about England's pitch, conditions and God knows what else. Take a break and give England their due.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In football, sometimes when a club gets battered say 6-0 or so, they offer refunds to the fans who traveled to support their team, @BCCI should follow that with a refund to the Indian supporters who attended this game. Abject performance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here come the excuses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best tweet of the year so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cech's PL season can only get better from here on. Shocking so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üòÇüòÇüòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>City could score a handful today (again). Arsenal need to settle, Cech could step up as a leader here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent analysis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mendy's movements on point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same old Arsenal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Karthik is having the opposite of the tour he had in '07. Horrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Patrice Evra hahahha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anderson and Broad ar world class bowlers and they are showing their class again. Our batsmen have been poor but, that's not the whole story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know it was only a friendly but watching Liverpool live at #annarbor, they looked extremely fluid with their movement, both on and off the ball. Played a  weak #United out of the park. #Shaqiri's golaza was the exclamation point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh lord, that #Sturridge celebration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In my years as a Indian cricket fan, the 2007 series win in England brought me the most joy until 2011 WC win at home. But with every away series in England being one battering after the other, the '07 series win has gained equal status as the 2011 WC win for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My prediction is Liverpool will rack up their highest tally of points in the last decade and still fall short to City.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This could be Liverpool's season. if they don't bottle against lesser teams, that is. A big ask for this side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The sooner #VAR comes, the better. Having said that, this scoreline is apt for the this game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mane lethal. Again, Liverpool look ridiculously strong going forward.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Liverpool continuing where they left off. But, early impressions of Pellegrini's #WestHam is that they are shit. Such a high line.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a stunning play and goal by Wolves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Richarlison proving his worth. Still too expensive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bielsa ball at work! Lampy noooo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cricketingview @guerillacricket More frustration than criticism. My bad. Hard to find meaningful strategies in frustration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cricketingview @guerillacricket It's a way of voicing criticism. It is not the role of fans to detail a 12-point program on how to bat; there are paid experts for that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Super Frankly Lampard taking on Bielsa!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Richarlison!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adiratan Exactly hahah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India should continue their generosity and entice Woakes and Baristow to go for 200s.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Waiting for some idiot to say 'Oh yeah England? Come to India, we will show you how to play cricket.'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hazard's impact is incredible. On the field for 15-20 mins and opposition defence backs off merely by his presence. Great player, great little cameo today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Given the circumstances since the end of last season and the start of this, that is as good a result as any Chelsea fan could have asked for. Long way to go, but started positively. Without getting carried away, plenty of positives from this game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>123 runs ahead. England should declare. (God, this is 2011 all over again.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Joginho has arrived! Great play earlier (and throughout) and a sweet, sweet penalty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bet Kante can pull off stunning saves as a keeper too. #cfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>KANTEEEEEEEEEEE CHAMPION DU MONDE!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lol, so what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tough to compare this work in progress side to a well-oiled Napoli side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully, we use this season to test out strategies and get rid of deadweight. Will be in good standing going into 19/20 season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Back 4 looks unconvincing in early signs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lots of sideways passing so far from #Chelsea. Sarri wants the pace to pick up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pakistan significantly dealt with English conditions better than India in the recent past. And they played in May when conditions favor the bowling side more so than now traditionally. India could learn a thing or two.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Newcastle deserve a second here. They've been quite good!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hyped to see #Sarriball in play today. Not expecting miracles but cautiously optimistic. I predict Chelsea to miss out on top 4, though. Hope I am wrong!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Andre Russell is the ideal modern T20 player. Incredible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NewcastleTottenham opening up nicely. Great end to end stuff!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Given the rain forecast for the next 2 days, I'd try to score as fast as I can and probably get to 200 or so and declare (or get bowled out). Then put India under the pump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Kenedy is quality. Another Chelsea player who leaves and shines elsewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Coming to England and complaining about conditions is silly and searching for excuses. Indian batsmen were shit, Anderson used the conditions brilliantly. Is asking for a bit of application too much to ask in the 1st innings of a fucking Test match?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even if we get England out for say around 150-160, India's batting is hopeless. I see another second innings crumble coming up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some awful defending from Spurs and Newcastle. Not complaining.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lolol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HAHAHAHA Can't beat #Redknapp transfer deadline day signing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All the best in Madrid, Tbooo. Get those trophies that you deserve!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Andres Gomes has made it in every rejected Barca bid this summer. Consistent in something at least.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Foden's move was great. But defense should have done better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Early signs that our defense is going to be easy to break down. Positive: Won't be playing City every week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First of many battles I hope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo @sidvee Little harsh on Hardik; Kohli took singles early too to get Hardik on strike. I almost felt as if he wanted Hardik to acclimatize to the conditions faster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonny_Singer I just saw the scorecard. That must have been some insane batting. Agree with you; cricket can be consumed with equal enthusiasm across formats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surrey did what?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do people get money if they keep saying shit like "Test cricket is still alive", "See! There's a future for Test cricket!", "Test cricket needs saving!". Is there a secret society that I am missing out on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo I'd rather see ourselves get into a winning position first; of course, throwing it away from there does hurt like a sombitch but inching in the right direction is nice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Ehh, I guess we differ there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Relative to the shitshow of our last tours to England man, where we got thumped. Glass half full, half empty and all that crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Losing sucks, but if there's one way to do it, it's the way India managed it. We gave it all, despite repeatedly shooting ourselves in the foot. On to the next one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Yeah, Kuldeep is a good shout. Definitely could have used Bhuvi, especially against tailenders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo One more seamer you think?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@netcitizen If you are talking about Rahul, then yeah I agree with you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Barring the one player who shouldn't have been dropped in the first place, Pujara.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Talking about dropping players left, right and center as if we have Lara, Sachin etc., waiting on the bench is stupid. Especially after 1 test out of 5.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khamaniyo Ouch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully, England replace (if they do so) Malan with another dud who can't score runs and drops catches.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In fairness, England were better. India (Kohli) rode their luck to make the difference seem less than what it actually is. Anderson and Broad have immense skill and experience. Any bowling attack has a significantly better chance of doing well with even one of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't see how this series will live up to this Test match. The bar has been set a little too high.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another gut-wrenching defeat in the first Test match of an away series. That's two this year. Hope we bounce back in the second one unlike in #SA. No need for knee jerk reactions but top order need to apply themselves more. Pujara in for Rahul should be the only change.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>At least Spain will wake up now to play some actual football.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spain blunt going forward. Slow in passing, Russia gifted an own goal for them to lead. Shut shop since then; even a simple long-ball caused panic in the Spain defense. And he were are at 1-1.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Also, great for the neturals (very few); opens the world cup up nicely for a new champion team to emerge. Not quite the time to deep dive and analyse; more the time to go for a walk and have some fun at your own team's failure w/o being too serious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From a German fan point of view, this hurts but it's OK. There will be change, maybe not wholesale changes which culminated in 2014 WC win, but minor tweaks and adjustments. A blip rather than a catastrophe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was nothing to suggest that they'd go and successfully defend their title during the qualifiers, friendlies and of course, against Mexico and Sweden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love ye Rafa!  https://t.co/IeAICneLUq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Germany, Brazil, Argentina, Spain, Italy -- these teams will wear the favorites tag every big tournament they play, before even looking at the team sheet or tactics or recent form. Germany came into this tournament with some serious questions marks, on and off the field.  https://t.co/xRPZtwDmRN<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Happy for Mexico and Korea (Asia shoutout) but no, winning 2014 WC does not make up for this failure. As much of a great success that was, this failure hurts, will hurt, and should hurt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, this feels awful. Scenes of 2014 still etched clear in my mind.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Great day of sports so far and I haven't even followed the Tennis or F1. England winning in both football and cricket. And now, Japan and Senegal are putting on a show. Both teams look like they can score going forward; love a bit of end-to-end football.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CricAussieFan T20 and ODIs are entirely different games played with the same white ball. I wouldn't use this as a basis to not select him for ODIs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They literally rode on Butler's performances, and it's kind of fitting that they lose without him. Kudos to #KKR bowlers, their real strong suite. Go well #Rahane, see ya in the colors that matter the most! #TeamIndia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can understand the fact that Rahane didn't indulge in too many big shots keeping the fragile middle order in mind, but he could have done much better rotating the strike.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a #CSK fan, I fear #KKR the most. Also, I'd rather lose to #SRH than #KKR.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very poor batting approach from #RR. I think #KKR will win #IPL2018.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#RR playing like a team that eked out a playoff spot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good umpiring and IPL -- 2 things that have nothing to do with each other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully CSK can improve on their shitty finals record.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Fukingggytgttttt gettttttt the fhckkk innnnnnn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is that out? Haha. Umpiring has been awful this IPL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If not CSK, I would be glad to see either #SRH or #RR lift it. Not feeling KKR. Can't beat #SRH for 'likeability'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finishing second in the league will come in handy for #CSK. Great effort from #SRH to recover while batting and then putting the foot down with the ball.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I doubt CSK will be able to come back after this defeat (impending). Odds will be better for them if Royals make it. KKR at Eden Gardens can be extremely difficult to overcome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought this was a batting pitch. Guess I was horribly wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright, done. CSK played well for 15 overs of the game. SRH with a proper counter punch in the next overs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SRH bowling not that great barring Bhuvi who set up Watson. Raina and Rayudu not playing the situation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Well played, Rahul. Another superb knock. Shame your team let you down again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CSK's success in IPL is a testament to the importance of due process with innovation always at the ready. Not the other way round.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why Dhoni goes on and on about the importance of process to the point where he can sometimes  come across as stubborn (and I've criticised him for this).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>T20 offers opportunities for innovation and change of tactics should the situation demand it. From a position of strength, needless tinkering in the process attracts risk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bumrah bowled superbly, but Mumbai collectively should thank Ashwin and Sehwag for this win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jeez, IPL teams come up some of the worst tactics in all of sport. Shocking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can Punjab be banned from the IPL for a season for their tactics today?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Magna International: Full Speed Ahead   https://t.co/qffi2FwLac  Shared from my Google feed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was a thoroughly entertaining game. Barca's defense tried to outdo Chelsea's and they were extremely successful opening the floodgates for Levante. Atletico are the only side that can defend in Spain. It's clear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ahahah  https://t.co/ACgYCMLWCq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5-3. Coutinho hatrick after Boateng hatrick. Insane game!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5-2. This is approaching Spurs-Leicester levels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a riot!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5-1 hahahaha barca<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4-1 Levante. Nuts!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Coutinho, uff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rahane is not a T20 player. Seems so out of it everytime he goes to bat in this format.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aha_irshi True. But he lacks confidence now which may go against him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Simple for Mumbai, get rid of Butler early and the game is theirs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Samson shows his retarded teammates how to catch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats to City for winning the league. Congrats also to United, Liverpool and Spurs for making top 4. Also, ta #Arsene.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Swansea players in tears. Sad to see but c'est la vie! Good luck!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh 100 points for City. Nice! Well done!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the end, kudos to Newcastle. Great game. See ya next season, @ChelseaFC ! #CFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spurs fucking with Liverpool fans and the third spot. Lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the fuck is going on in this game!  https://t.co/RJZbuuazTS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should have watched Spurs-Lei game knowing how Chelsea game would pan out. It's that little teeny meeny shitty hope that kills ye.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I knew #Newcastle were going to be tough coming into this despite their recent defeats but you'd think with a top 4 spot up for grabs, Chelsea would know some intent. Nada.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heheh  https://t.co/VneQ0ITC1N<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't really know why I am getting worked up when I came into this game expecting exactly this. Good thing there's world cup as distraction in the summer. (No hopes for FA cup either).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>High highs and low lows. Chelsea's theme in the last 4-5 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I haven't seen Chelsea defend this badly in eons. Next weekend is going to be a slaughter. Defenders have no clue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Benitez has done wonders with #Newcastle. Amazing display in a game where they have nothing in it. Conte, that's how you motivate players.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lol.  https://t.co/ImZ5AaSRne<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Conte has to go. From the home against #Burnley, he has given the impression that he doesn't want to be there. #cfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chelsea fans should start a Kickstarter for Monaco to re-sign #Bakayako.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Mumbai on course for 200 another 'comeback' IPL trophy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Take a bow, Salah! Good luck in the final!  https://t.co/8UqQn3XH1C<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Liverpool score. That's that then. Chelsea should try to use this as warm up for next week's final. (They might already be given the way they are playing.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Typical from Chelsea Lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chelsea might be ending up in Europa. Won't be the worst thing if they can win titles in between poor seasons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, last day of PL always brings sadness. Even during a world cup year. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dhoni showing great awareness by finishing the game off in time as Chelsea kick off. :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aaaluma doluma blaring. Apt. What a thumping knock by Rayudu and a thumping win against the best defenders of the year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chelsea dropping points against Newcastle while Brighton end up beating Liverpool will sum up Chelsea's season perfectly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Raina, sometimes, plays like an absolute dumbass. No game awareness. He joins Uthappa in that club with his retarded shot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe that's why Bravo's there. Good catch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CSK come closest to @cricketingview's idea of T20 side. More focus on batting with a side glance to bowling. (Not by design)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Harbhajan, where are your darts man? If you have no variety, go for the darts! Simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SRH gonna win it all, aren't they? #FutureChampions #IPL2018<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having said all of that, Williamson and Dhawan have been awesome this year. I doubt if #SRH's own bowling would put a brake on these 2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Second no ball not called. What's with SRH getting these no calls against CSK?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #CSK had one more good bowler to go with Chahar, that'd be awesome. Sadly, not the case. Teams can choose to play out Chahar and go after the rest. 10-11 RPO easily attainable against the rest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SRH batting approach is very similar to that of CSK from past years. They aim to retain wickets in first 10 overs and go for it in the last 10.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am fairly confident #SRH will reach 170-180 from here, smart batting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Bravo shouldn't be bowling ever. He's awful!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>CSK is so similar to India of 2000s, Loaded with batting talent with almost non-existent bowling talent. Teams with weak bowling lose more than teams with weak batting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good thing CSK didn't start slowly which means they can afford off-days like today.  Even a W-L-W-L from here should take them to playoffs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cancerous argument.  https://t.co/dvTbSTOck1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If CSK play with 10 men, they'll fare better than with Jaddu. Totally out of sorts this season. We have seen this stubborn side of Dhoni hurt India before, now it's hurting CSK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dhoni with nayi soch giving Bravo the ball to get that early shower. 3rd loss out of 9 for CSK. I'll take it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With Karthik and co in fine nick, 177 was never going to challenge them. Needed 200 at least to have a contest today given CSK's poor bowling, KKR"s depth in batting and the size of Eden Gardens.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Bowling is like defense in soccer. Unfortunately, IPL teams don't give a shit about it except Sunrisers. Bowling wins you titles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First choice, second change, third change. All so predictable. #CSK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>obvious weakness*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CSK needs to lose this understand their obvious bowling is not even backyard cricket standards. Hopefully no escape today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>250 on for Punjab here. CSK are at their usual shit bowling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching Pique defend will make aspiring defenders give up the enitre sport.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Someday, a lesser Juve team will get past Real and it'll leave the current set of Juve players laughing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Madrid heading for their 3rd title while Buffon's Juve goes out agonizingly. Deserved or not, Real are through (I hate even saying it).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cricketingview But he has proved that his 'one track mind' approach has been successful for him over time. Hence, astonishing even going by your logic (no pun), right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aha_irshi Kuldeep Yadav<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apt finish to a stupendous innings!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cricketingview I am astonished by the execution of logic, in this case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cricketingview Why can't it be both?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everybody and their mom knows what Bravo is gonna deliver.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yadav and Chawla will be a handful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This score is already beyond CSK's reach.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I stick with the same prediction as I did on Saturday: CSK to get demolished here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The importance of Andre Russell to KKR is huuuuuuge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perfect launchpad for KKP against a weak CSK death bowling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chelsea! Get in lads! #RIPRay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vinay Kumar, consistently rubbish over 11 seasons. That's remarkable!<|endoftext|>
