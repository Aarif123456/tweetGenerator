<|startoftext|>@SkyNews This fear OF Covid killing far more than Covid itself. Doctors are literally telling my grandad, who needs urgent help, that it's just ”nothing to do with us” &amp; won't tell him anything... He is in debilitating pain &amp; is now effecting my nan's mental health... It's plain cruelty!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤦‍♂️🏻 Biden voters 🤡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Putting the fact he IS one of the most successful racing car drivers in history. Do y’all really think he would have got a pit renamed after him this year if it BLM wasn’t causing such a fuss?... course not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@almurray And vote in who exactly? an even worse labour government?... that’s your best joke yet.

<|startoftext|>@XboxSeriesXPS5 @0ldD0gNewTricks @SkyNews Not saying he IS a role model... Just saying its generally expected of celebs because of their influence. A felon with a gold gun just feeds into the ’I'm a gangsta, straight killer, Cuh!’ mentality, thus continuing the cycle of gang/gun crime, particularly with black communities<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pvriswhite I'm not saying he IS, I'm saying we generally expect celebrities to be good role models because they have such influence with their fans etc... I don't care he was arrested, it's his own dumbass fault. A famous felon with a gold plated gun... Sends a stupid message to kids, imo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@0ldD0gNewTricks @SkyNews Well, that's what I'm getting at. He is in a position to be a role model. People usually tend to look up to celebrities as role models, yet they tend to always do drugs &amp; dumb shit that can rub off on &amp; influence young people/ kids. Ya’know?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StuartB11668434 @SkyNews Boris can’t negotiate if they just demand...

<|startoftext|>@StuartB11668434 @SkyNews The EU, in particular macron, are getting increasingly demanding &amp; cocky, negotiations died months ago. You're right, they won't make it easy, they want to punish us... they will try to keep us strangled &amp; controlled as much as they can because they are petrified of competition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShaneDun2 @snart05224943 @SkyNews They're not offering us anything, they demand control of our waters as if we owe them something. they would NEVER agree if we ask for access to their waters/land, so why should we.

<|startoftext|>@RatedScorpio @justcallmesihle @bigtittyniga That’s some dumb sh*t. women dont lose income, you both do, you’re married!

<|startoftext|>@MxrkTT @Ye_Olde_Holborn @LFCNxsir @SkySportsNews booing isnt racism. maybe, like most, they're sick of politics being forced into everything. relentlessly forcing something on people just causes resentment &amp; resistance. forcing things on people does the opposite of what you want. whats the meaning of taking the knee now anyway.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AOC How? HOW?... you never say how!  you may think you’re being clever by tweeting out one liners like this to get young naive people hyped up “OMG yass Queen!

<|startoftext|>Joe Bidens new America, this will only get worse. mainstream media are complicit &amp; have orchestrated this.

Simply just raising tax during a pandemic will just end up causing the big &amp; lesser businesses to leave the US and small businesses to collapse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AustinOnTwitter @Wolf_P1 @IlhanMN You will have to worry when all the rich people just straight up leave or move their assets or banks etc  offshore so not to pay absurd taxes, thus leaving the least well off to fill the tax void. This will just scare off business &amp; investors and leave everyone worse off😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IlhanMN If only it was that simple.

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Lol, chill your bollocks will you. it's highly likely Biden (unfortunately) will be president. Biden is anti-British as it is... if he does become pres, the last thing Boris needs is to be on the record dismissing Bidens presidency &amp; showing favour to trump... its common sense.🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@awrightdave @geoffl65 @LBC @SadiqKhan @mrjamesob That balloon permit literally has to go through Sadiq to approve or deny it.

As far as I'm concerned, he is squatting as mayor because he delayed the election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @SadiqKhan @mrjamesob No, Trump can see, just like every other normal person, how Sadiq has trashed London and is a vile slimy weasel who plays victim &amp; pushes the blame away from himself.

<|startoftext|>@toryboypierce @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Democracy’s Integrity is more important than who's side wins, both sides should rise above their differences &amp; take fraud seriously. ’BuT tHErEs No EvIdEnCe!’.

<|startoftext|>@toryboypierce @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Yes, but what if it genuinely was voter fraud?...

<|startoftext|>@corrcomm @AFP ”War is peace”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watch this space. Biden's stance &amp; attitude towards North Korea in the last presidential debate should be cause for concern enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews They're too busy laughing at the US, they cant believe their luck. Especially China, Russia, Iran &amp; North Korea. the US will be very vulnerable &amp; weak without trump. With Biden, North Korea tensions will rise, china will walk all over the US &amp; Iran will try pushing its luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaajidNawaz @tedcruz Mate, you need to calm down, you're speaking too calmly, sensibly &amp; with too much common sense... That's very dangerous to do in 2020. Twitter is about to start flagging you for fact checks &amp; misleading tweets 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ABC You clearly don't remember, remember the 5th of November... Do some research. Biden is anti-brexit &amp; anti-British, da fuk we gonna celebrate him being elected for when It's bad for Britain?...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvonandsomerRob @SocialM85897394 De-escalated tensions with North Korea &amp; The Begining of/groundwork for peace in the middle east, I like see how long it takes Biden to squander it 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jadecsgo_OF @JadeCSGO Biden is happy enough just sniffing your hair 😂 leave that cake for someone else to eat😋🎂🍴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Well, if Biden's record of handling North Korean tensions is anything to go by, I wouldn't be surprised if we see a war with North Korea by 2022...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whatthefinance2 @SkyNews You clearly haven't listened to trump’s stance on wars &amp; conflicts. Remember, Biden &amp; Obama left office leaving America, if not the world, on the brink of semi-nuclear war with North Korea... You'd do well to remember who it was who de-escalated &amp; stopped the war from happening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews I highly doubt Biden will be uniting anyone or anything... I expect US - UK relation to be at an all-time low, Chinese manipulation &amp; US - North Korea tensions to be at an all-time high, we had a taste of Biden's capability to deal with that 4 years ago, it was the brink of war.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darrengrimes_ Jesus Christ, the Left are even segregating black or should say ”BAME”(a term of segregation in itself) people who died in war.🤦‍♂️🏻 as for this white poppy to honour those who died trying to end the war... the allies literally doing that... so a white poppy is pointless...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@am_wex @jonfavs @persistentpengn Coddling dictators?... Because going to war &amp; forcibly removing them has worked so well in the middle east... Biden &amp; Obama's incompetence left the US on the brink of semi nuclear war with North Korea... Trump De-escalated the mess. I give Biden 6 months to raise tensions again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CountDankulaTV Biden &amp; Obama’s incompetence left the US on the brink of semi-nuclear war with North Korea, which Trump De-escalated in a historic face to face sit down, something Joe could never achieve. How long until Biden antagonises Kim-Jon-un &amp; sets tensions back 4 years? I give it 6months<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cherriebIossoms Why? What did he do wrong?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly, trump has every right to  play up &amp;not accept he lost, no matter how clear it is. I hope he plays up for the next 3 years &amp; puts Biden through endless bullshit so the left understands how toxic the bullshit they tried pulling for the last 3-4 years was. Its only fair.🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fredolia @piersmorgan The virus literally came FROM china so of course he’d close off the board to it's place of origin... if it came from a white nation &amp; he only closed the bored to that nation, would you still call it racism?🙄 He didn't downplay the virus, he just wasn't hysterical &amp; causing fear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC After you've written your list of wrong thinkers &amp; opposition dissidence, why don't you just round us all up in train carriages and hull us off &amp; be done with it? I'm sure you'd love nothing more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abc88918 @yazhadi1 @Jo_Marney @Reuters They shouldn't try entering illegally then, its simple, their deaths are on their own hands, no one elses. it sounds harsh but the majority of us in the West are telling them not to come here, yet they persist because the left encourages them &amp; then politicise their dead bodies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fredolia @piersmorgan Causing a panic is the worst thing to do🤦‍♂️🏻. He closed the borders early which Biden called him xenophobic for doing, how many more would have died if he kept them open? Deaths are inevitable, we cant save them all. &amp; the lack of individuals responsibility is the problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snb19692 Biden is far far more likely to press the nuclear button. 4 years ago Biden &amp; obama literally left the US on the brink of a nuclear war with North Korea. trump had to clean it up, he peacefully de-escalated. Trump has always been anti-war &amp; has promoted &amp; brokered peace in the ME<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fredolia @piersmorgan A monster? How so?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Another amazing stat:  a large portion of votes for Biden isn’t actually FOR Biden, they are just against trump, they just had no one else to vote for  it was either a guy they hate or a senile old man, who they will end up hating too because they didn’t want him to begin with🔄.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheTweetOfGod I give it 6 month until Kim Jon un starts playing up again &amp; Biden just starts antagonising him, putting the US on the brink of semi nuclear war again, just like him &amp; Obama did 4 years ago then they left the mess for trump to deal with, which he did, peacefully, face to face.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Make no mistake, months of endless &amp; inaccurate polls telling people ’it will be a biden landslide!

<|startoftext|>to literally stop counting votes in the middle of an election is insane. just get it done! why pointlessly drag it out over 3+ days?... what happens to all the ballots while people fuck off home? why not rotate counters? &amp; why allow post votes to still be cast AFTER polls close?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pokket lmao, polls close at a certain time to stop stupid shit like this happening. people had weeks &amp; all day yesterday to vote up until official poll closing times. if you miss your train it doesn't come back to pick you up. the courts stupid decision underminds elections in general🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jb_sharpey @SkyNews that being said, US police would do themselves a favour if they showed more constraint. just because you have a firearm, doesn't mean you have to use it. there isn't much of an excuse to gun down someone with a knife when they can be subdued in a number of less lethal ways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jb_sharpey @SkyNews hard for US cops to adopt a less-lethal approach similar to the UK when its in the US constitution that citizens have a right to bear arms &amp; guns are easily obtainable. US cops have a constant worry on the back of their minds that anyone they confront can pull a gun in seconds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Children have little concept of thing such as racism. he is only thinking it is racism because the people around him are drumming a victim mentality into his young mind.

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews all well &amp;good preaching FREE this, FREE that... sounds wonderful, but its not free. it will cost millions. millions we literally dont have, the coffers are empty, the UK is spiralling into debt, we are lucky we got this far thanks to rishi, but practically can not spend any more<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sh3lby118 @jaceevs @SkyNews we have a lot less land than France, what makes you think all those 1000s of illegal immigrants will be in better conditions on UK beaches? we can barely feed our own children at the moment let alone house 1000s of immigrants in accommodation better than half the north's.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews we've told them DONT COME, yet they persist. if they die crossing, that's their own fault, they have no legitimate reason to cross the channel from a safe country. France is safe, so anyone crossing is coming for, dare I say it, handouts, not safety. @BorisJohnson fix up wise up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WatchRatio Not sure. I know I found out about some sado who made a Twitter account who just spends all day blocking anyone even slightly right wing. they never interacted with you, they instantly block you then inform other lefties to block everyone on their big list they make.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews You’d understand why if you see them in the streets... they literally call themselves roadmen. they go out in groups wearing big pufferjackets with massive hoods, masks(even without a pandemic), they make themselves look suspicious. they even stab each other over postcodes ffs...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@problem_we I mean, I have a British PEPE as my twitter header.... should I now be cancelled &amp; thrown in prison?   In the words of joe Biden: cumon man!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@problem_we PEPE. Isn’t. A. White. Supremacy. Symbol!!! The ignorant &amp; naive MSM branded it so because they don’t understand it&amp; online culture. If ‘LOL’ wasnt so well know and a racist killed a black person then bragged online in a tweet &amp; put LOL, the MSM should brand it a racist acronym🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JadeCSGO Damn, you really went from sippin tea to sippin champagne, huh? 🍾🥂👏🏼😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanRich95 Where can I watch it?  Pepe isn't even a hate symbol or a white supremacist symbol. that's just what the ignorant media labelled it as because they don't understand it. Pepe is more than just a meme too, its form of expression, no one knows this better than the Twitch community.<|endoftext|>

I say months, we all know the democrats will be extremely childish &amp; bitter about this even on their death beds...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>no wonder #democrat supporters are so hysterical when they have people like this guy in congress pushing extreme levels of fear. I think everything he is saying is bollocks but ill be honest, even I felt scared after listening to him... he almost convinced me I was going to die🤣  https://t.co/Rvmz7eaqLC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jadedcreative This is just low key cruel.  The is the purest form of selfishness, to guilt trip a dying man &amp; essentially force him to do as you demand otherwise you will hold it against him even while he is cold in the grave. you really going to make him feel ashamed for dying? disgraceful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CY25_Skip @jadedcreative Against their wishes? What the hell are you chatting?🤦🏻‍♂️sounds like its your son’s problem, not their grandparents. maybe if you riased your sons not to be so selfish &amp; respect that people have their own &amp; different options, then maybe they wouldnt be so vile to their grandparents<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews It’s as if hundreds of men illegal crossing the channel to get into the UK ISNT NORMAL!... if we set up a shiny new official building then that just legitimatises them coming across. as if we don’t encourage them to cross enough as it is...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@diediediepi almost as if Obama &amp; Biden were the ones who built those conditions in detention centres in the first place and the Democrats being the ones promoting &amp; encouraging people to cross illegally which results in them being put in the Biden detention centres in the first place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boehm_justin @realDonaldTrump he didn't push her... are you really that desperate?  he held her hand but she pulled it away so he went to put his hand round her waist but she was walking off the stage at a faster pace than trump so his waist hug was left hanging so he styled it to look like he was guiding her<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GerardBattenUK Trump’s team need a drone to fly over the rallies &amp; record just how big the crowds are. Do the media’s job which they wont do.

<|startoftext|>@AOC to streamers who are going to shamelessly pedal &amp; promote AOC's politics to their own innocent naive viewers tonight while playing with her, shame on you, it's extremely irresponsible &amp; manipulative and you should honestly know better. I expect more from people in your positions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC AOC is a nasty, vile, bitter woman, she doesn't appreciate or care about the streaming community. this is just a cheap political stunt to manipulate young people to vote democrats by acting 'hip &amp; cool' &amp; 'down with the kids'...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC disappointing to see all these streamers ignorantly &amp; irresponsibly willing to expose their naive &amp; easily influenced young viewers to this woman's nasty bitter politics for some cheap clout of playing with a politician who actually couldn't give a fuck about gaming or streaming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews We did tell them not to come... maybe if the government made that abundantly clear then they would know illegally crossing the channel is a waste of time.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden bearly answered 4 questions in his town hall, he rambled &amp; no one was satisfied with his answers while @realDonaldTrump was on fire, he was precise, sharp and his answers were clear, I can't fault his performance, tbh. if there was a winner, trump easily won by miles.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>both scary &amp; fascinating to watch but also very sad seeing all those ecstatic children &amp; soldiers chanting away knowing they are being rased on lies &amp; indoctrinated. all they know its what the party want them to know, the majority of them don't have a clue of the outside world.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC @TomSwarbrick1 @Ianblackford_MP majority of the UK rejects the SNP's bitterly divisive rhetoric. we refuse to allow the SPN's sinister actions of breeding a false hatred in Scotland towards our union so to destabilise it &amp; drive a wedge to rip us apart! the SNP represent their own selfishness, not Scotland.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @TomSwarbrick1 and the majority of the UK find it "remarkable" that @Ianblackford_MP &amp; the SNP still won't shut up with this continuous &amp; monotonous anti-UK droning and accept they lost the ref. we cant keep having such major Refs every few years until they get their selfish power-hungry way...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BBCWorld Trump finds it hard to breathe with his small nasal passage as it is so I don't know how it will be for him if he does start to show symptoms but that being said, for his age &amp; weight he has remarkable stamina to keep going like he does, he doesn't seem to ever rest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews There is an alleged 1 million total COVID deaths across the world... guess what, people were inevitably going to die, no one has the power of God to just wave away a virus &amp; stop anyone dying... We are honestly lucky that is isn't worse considering we knew nothing about the virus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Just a bit of advice, if you want to stay out of the limelight &amp; the press, it helps if you didn't spend every waking hour of your day ,from the moment you wake, trying to ensure you are in the papers almost every day lecturing the people of the UK which you turn your back on...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour really should stop trying to act all high &amp; mighty about these restrictions now... Every day a labour MP is caught breaking the rules, just like the Torys &amp; public.

<|startoftext|>Obama &amp; Biden left the US on the brink of a semi-nuclear war with North Korea, Trump de-escalated.

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews You are supposed to actually do something to earn such a prestigious award. like, oh I dunno, rapidly de-escalate away from war with North Korea &amp; meet with Kim face to face IN North Korea or help broker peace in the ME instead of help stain the sand with more blood? Just an idea<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@addicted2newz It’s going to be both hilarious &amp; embarrassing with the usual American cringeworthy moments for us non-Americans. I expect a lot of stumbling from Biden too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCWorld Yeahhh but it’s not those is it, she’s saying that because she HATES trump she’d honestly say anything as long as it hurt trump or resulted/ helped get him out of office.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC @TomSwarbrick1 I mean... theres plenty of spunk to go round, did they really need to chose his jizz when it was probably clear his had a specific terms &amp; conditions😂  like, why we feeding this mentality of same sex couples should have overriding rights &amp; special treatment over a bit of jizz🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Way to kill your own brand... 🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Why report this when they are refusing to show a single piece of evidence?... are you dumb? you’re reporting it as if it’s fact when its just claims from a trump hating news station🤣 aufully convenient timing for such a claim. almost as if they’ve been saving for the right time.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@monaco_francs @leetb77 @SkyNews If friends weren’t on TV you wouldn’t call it an issue because it would just be an everyday fact that there are more white only friend groups here in the West because this corner of the world is majority white, just like the majority of Asia is Asian or Africa is majority African<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@monaco_francs @leetb77 @SkyNews Oh dear, a friend group of just white people, damn, someone call the KKK!its not weird nor racist for there to be friend groups of people of the same colour... it’s literally like that all over the world for any colour... yet it’s only the whites who are demanded to be diverse?🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Why?🙄you could literally make an entire new show for your tokenitic pandering but instead you want to pull ‘one off’ patronising stunts or alter &amp; change already successful &amp; established shows simply because you decide the original casts skin is suddenly unacceptable...😬🤔  https://t.co/pCzSvHsjK2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just because you’re offended, doesn’t mean you’re right and it certainly doesn’t give you any special rights or status, nor does it mean that the thing you chose to find offensive should be erased or alters in any way.   “I’m offended!”, okay? Now what? Offence is subjective!...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBCNews You can try &amp; cover up the past with your token guilt all you like, that won’t change the unchangeable past, you need to get a grip. The past is the past... stop getting so hysterical over a time you never knew &amp; which can never be changed. Do something productive for the future!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Obsidian Bro, why new Vegas 2 though? Maybe a remake(not remaster) of the original but a sequel? Meh... I’d just prefer an entirely new location, Miami, Texas, Chicago or a remake of the original fallout in California, seems like the best idea so much lore there, west coats is ignored.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCWorld So, technically, they died fighting in WWII...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, over half of America has now died according to @JoeBiden  the world weeps for America in this sudden tragic event...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrumpWarRoom @benshapiro Oh that poor guy, Can't we just stop playing this game with him and stop giving him &amp; his handlers false hope that he actually has a chance of winning?...

<|startoftext|>@SportsCenter The baby isn't water skiing... he has been strapped onto it by his parents who chose to make their baby do that. it just looks so uncomfortable for that baby... Why?... Just why? It's weird to be promoting it to your 30m+ followers🤔 Would be different if he was like 5 years old.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AwesomEmergency I still dont understand this show, what, why and how it is a thing? I can't see how it fits in with things... Is this some kind of simulation or some alternate life vision imagined moments before his death or something like that?? The trailer confuses me🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@disneyplus I'm still baffled as to the point of this show &amp; how it works &amp; fits in? Is this some kind of simulation or last thoughts of vision playing out as his imagined a normal life seconds before he died?? I'm so confused... I just wish vision never died... He was too underused☹️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GMB ...a second lockdown will cause more deaths and health problems than the pandemic itself... and with an almost triple stalled economy, it’s bound to cause problems for years to come with both health &amp; the economy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB Absolutely not. We have the brexit transition ending soon, the last thing we need is another economy stalling lockdown on an already stalled economy from the previous one, especially when the end of the transition period is bound to effect &amp; stall certain parts of the economy...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Hammer19803 @BBCWorld Lol chill, it's one party that had an accident, I'm pretty sure the intention of gender reveal parties are not to start a wildfire. In no way does an accident at one mean all of them should be outright banned. 🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OrwellNGoode To that I say, fuck off.  none of that is relevant to a presidency whatsoever.

<|startoftext|>@DisneyPlusUK this is going to be a dog shit remake like many other live-action remakes... lacking everything that made the originals great. it's not Mulan, it's just some generic Chinese themed movie. you removed the one thing that made Mulan stand out as a Disney movie...

<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 Left-wing comedy is forced on us &amp; is just a form of political attack disguised as condescending comedy. whereas so-called 'right-wing comedy' is just normal comedy which normal people, whos lives aren't consumed by &amp; revolves around politics, want to be free to laugh at anything<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zara_Bukake_MP The fact we are paying that much in the first place is absolutely ridiculous! We absolutely should drastically cut foreign aid. Counties that dependent on foreign aid will never be able to grow if they stay so dependent.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chris48163264 @ffscj @emilyhewertson It’s majority of people on the right who are the ones complaining about their freedoms not the left, labour supports tougher lockdown, masks etc so why would those moaning about freedom run to a party who will restrict their freedom more than the tories😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyhewertson I mean, sunak has borrowed/ spent/pledged an extreme amount of money like it was nothing to keep various thing running during the pandemic etc, not saying that’s a bad thing, but we are now in a recession &amp; have a huge bill to pay back from wherever he borrowed all the money. 🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @darrenadam opinion polls are the biggest load of bollocks.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews well, that's utterly humiliating for Banksy, LOL. thinking he is clever painting a cute boat to tempt yet more to cross &amp; the thing breaks down. now they are stranded &amp; dying because he promised to bring them to the promised land but it failed horribly. if some die, it's on him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon you mean anything that isn't British... that's your idea of diversity. celebrating anything but the countries own history, culture, values and traditions.<|endoftext|>

From what I gather from the little I see, it’s the governors who’s watch it is on, not the presidents. There is a reason all the rioting is only happening in democrat run states.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HannaFlint people seriously acting like this is the coming for the fourth Reich... get a grip. he was just some old bloke on the far outskirts of the protest observing in just like many other people on the outskirts who were not part of the protest. there's a reason he was on the outskirts.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MizKaiii @slscwg @SkyNews it was a throwaway comment, dont get so caught up over it😂 if Obama said it, you'd all be like 'OMG hehe, he is so kind, lets start a GoFundMe to pay for it &amp; gift it to a fan'. if someone is genuinely willing to buy it for $10k, that's up to them, it's their problem, not yours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews as for the e-bay comment... come off it, you really think people haven't thought of that and are doing that shit already? wise up.  if trump had a towel he used to wipe his sweat I guarantee someone would buy it...  https://t.co/RQJP0bjMlq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews he said he "wants a little power" because his 'team', like any other governmental teams restrict &amp; plan their leader's movements, dealings, security etc almost down to the second. it likely can be a little suffocating being like that every day hence why trump overruled the guy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBSNews if trump is as stupid &amp; ignorant etc as the democrats love to keep on about... then a public televised debate is the perfect opportunity for the democratic to rip trump apart and expose him but they are too scared of letting Biden into a debate because of his mental deterioration<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews this lot trying too hard to be/mimic martin Luther king... they fail hard because they are not genuine like MLK, they want superiority, not genuine equality. they act like things are worse now than ever before. mind you, they have set race relations back like 20 years already...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews no way you are STILL pushing this non-news...  its literally nothing, she smiled at her as a welcome then went to her 'model pout' because the cameras everywhere... and i wouldn't even be surprised if smiling hurt her damn face with all that plastic in it.  just report real news.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews he won't get charged with murder or anything like that, it was clear self-defence. the idiots where curb stopping his arse while he had an automatic rifle, what did they expect? he had the right to defend himself. but he could likely be charged with use of a firearm underage.🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @darrenadam They’re homeless in the 1st place because they have no money. what idiot can think of something so stupid and think it’s a clever idea? Maybe put our own homeless up in hotels with £40 a week &amp; help them into work, instead of illegal immigrants. Help homeless to help the economy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KingJames @macawcaw123 WOW, so inspirational... such detail, such depth, such passion, such intelligence! so moving.   ...if only we knew what you were on about exactly, instead of putting out a vague tweet which most people are only liking because they're interpreting it in different ways. 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>the defunding of the #BBC is inevitable at this point, they are only going to make the defunding process harsher and harsher on themselves the more they shamelessly spout this bile in our faces. we should also remove the word British from the BBC. #ScumMedia  #DefundTheBBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@catrionalewis i believe the slaves would find a statue/memorial to their sacrifice &amp; suffering extremely patronising. the memorials wouldnt be to honour slaves, they'd be to fuel your lots moral superiority complexes &amp; egos while you circle jerk each other over how superior you all feel...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeanFletcherTV @catrionalewis damn, this is some public cringy BBC circle jerk shit... its so embarrassing. after we inevitably #DefundTheBBC i really hope we remove the word British from the British broadcasting cooperation, they do not represent Britain &amp; its people anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@braggendasz @bethvaughan15 @SkyNews well, they're British anthems... so of course, they're only going to specify the British. just as the majority of other nations anthems only specify their own people too... but because its the British saying they will never be slaves, suddenly it's unacceptable &amp; offensive...😴🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fr33_hk @LBCNews the pricing is disgusting, but they got to make their money back somehow from this stunt they wasted millions on. but hey, at least you know the trolly staff &amp; driver arent straight. thats the issue with trains, they're not gay enough. the late trains &amp; overpriced fares are fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews first &amp; last I hope, its a weird &amp; unnecessary stunt, how many millions wasted on this? all we need is cheaper fares &amp; the damn trains to run on time.

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Wait... So last week people freaked out over low grades but this week grades are miraculously the highest ever??

<|startoftext|>@TheSimpsons no one wants the Simpsons to start wading in on real-life politics... we watch you for some relief to get away from all that, not be lectured by a cartoon over a measly throwaway comparison we all forgot in 30 seconds.  stick to predicting the future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCWorld she said black lives matter🤦‍♂️. she certainly didn't say she supports the Marxist movement (BLM)... get it right. more and more people are turning away &amp; against BLM the movement, its a Marxist anarchist movement for black superiority &amp; destabilisation of western society.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bf4Russian @RockstarGames liberty city is already built, they just have to remaster it &amp; make small changes. its vastly easier than creating a whole map/game(GTA6) from the ground up. they have enough devs to remaster an old map &amp; work on GTA6 at the same time. they will also make millions from it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dsmooth1001 @RockstarGames yes, but there are rumours there will be a new location, either on the map or by flying in a loading screen. liberty city is the logical choice &amp; is already built, just needs a remaster. they can/will milk millions from an easy expansion like that while slowly developing GTA 6.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@exbortgamer @RockstarGames so they really are going to add a whole new area/map?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jackbentham34 @RockstarGames not sure they can do much with RD2, IMO.  like, what can they really add? to me, RD2 is primarily a show-off game of the level of detail they are capable of (both graphical &amp; the small detailed mechanics like the gun cleaning etc) rather than a fully feature-packed game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>stick to selling overpriced diabetes in tubs &amp; profiting off obesity. these illegally trafficked immigrants are coming from France, THEY'RE NOT FLEEING ANYTHING. stop endorsing people trafficking &amp; modern slavery. you think you're woke but you're just being dumb. #benandjerrysuk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OxfordDiplomat @benandjerrysUK @pritipatel yes, selling vastly overpriced diabetes in a tub is definitely making the world a better place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrantTailor @SkyNews @AliFortescue You realise they are coming from France, right? they pasted through at least 2-3 other safe nations to get to the channel. THERE IS LITERALLY NO LEGITIMATE REASON FOR ANY IMMIGRANTS TO CROSS THE CHANNEL. Anyone on the side of these crossing is condoning human trafficking, simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RockstarGames So liberty city isn't being added to the game? Damn rumours!  I see no point in updating the game anymore, you made your billions. The cow is officially milked. Now put all the dev time into GTA 6. It's probably not coming up til the end of the life of the upcoming console gen😩<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBCNews Between you, sky &amp; BBC, literally every 3rd tweet I see on my feed is you lot tweeting every hour about this fucking non-issue... I get it, she's just doing her usual race-baiting... Stop feeding her ego. There was no racism on the officer's side what so ever. End of discussion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @NickFerrariLBC No. the officer confirmed they mistyped the licence plate... it was nothing more than a minor insignificant error of a typo. yet old dawny here can only see skin colour so she immediately flipped it into an end of the world racial problem. She was just the mouthy passenger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THE OFFICERS MISTYPED THE NUMBER PLATE INTO THE DATABASE, THAT IS NOT RACIST!! It wasn't even her car and she wasn't even driving! Why is she making it about her?🤦‍♂️🏻🤦‍♂️🏻🤦‍♂️🏻 if I was those officers i’d say fuck this shit and quit. They shouldn't put up with the BS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBCNews £30 million for what? to service some more ships to escort more illegal immigrants across into British waters?... they have some cheek, why would they want to stop illegal immigrants leaving their territory? once they cross into our waters it then becomes the UK taxpayers burden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewBurfield @harrylee19891 @LBCNews he mispronounced 1 word then immediately corrected himself. if you think 'the most powerful man in the world' mispronouncing 1 word is bad wait until you see how the candidate running to be the 'most powerful man' struggles to even put his sentences together. 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SholaMos1 THEY HAVE NO LEGITIMATE REASON TO CROSS THE CHANNEL. they're coming from France, what are they fleeing? snails? we're not welcoming ILLEGAL immigrants because a less than a 000.1% chance a descendant might become a mediocre PM in 100yrs. we have 66m legitimate civilians to be PM.  https://t.co/hAt9tz3GQA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@petertimmins3 absolutely no one on those french beaches has a legitimate reason to cross the channel. they aren't fleeing from war in a safe country like France... they come because of how soft &amp; weak our establishment is in dealing with illegals, they get treated better than our own poorest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCWorld god forbid an actor ACTS!... like fuck me... get we get a damn grip already. this kind of mentality can not go on. it's going so far that now even black women are shaming themselves for playing the part of a black woman... its insane.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RockstarGames that's nice for the 100 players who play.  so when is GTA 6?

<|startoftext|>@50CalBeats @JimMFelton @elonmusk sending a car into space wasn't the point. and tesla is the leading company in electric vehicles, the truck is an energy sustainable alternative. all these things benefit the future of humanity immensely. also, they are not 'hellish' conditions... sweatshops in Asia are hellish.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews GOING. ABOUT. IT. THE. WRONG. WAY. cheap money incentives &amp; banning adverts is the wrong approach! we need to promote a positive mindset on working out &amp; exercising! make gyms &amp; healthy foods cheaper. incorporate gyms into schools. promote good workout/exersise routines for free.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Your colour doesn't entitle you to a ’powerful’ job or any job. If companies are hiring based on skin colour that is literal racism.

<|startoftext|>@LBCNews This is only happening to appease BLM Marxist. nothing to do with honouring historically significant black people.

<|startoftext|>@HappyHarryMedia she isn't calling for equality, she is calling for superiority.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews she doesn't understand that people don't have the same level of capability And before she tried playing victim, she should consider accepting the fact that maybe she is just generally a shitter driver than her costars so required more time to train?...

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews as for adults, it wont stop them... if they are addicted to junk food, they will go out and get it, not wait for a damn advert. and they will obviously be aware of a junk food ad ban so they know the food will still be available in the shops, even if they don't see it on TV🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews for a start, Kids dont watch TV, they are too busy playing fortnite NOT GETTING EXERCISE all day. nothing to do with adverts. you know what will help? gyms at schools, building a positive mindset for exercise. instead of meaningless sports games for P.E., do gym routines.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBCNews ’fake content’?... Na, its probably to do with how gobby she is🤣 she's so vicious &amp; rude.

<|startoftext|>@kay_1773 @BBCWorld why do they deserve it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCWorld a bunch of yobs broke in looking to vandalise private homes on a gated community... so a couple comes out on their property with their guns to rightfully protect themselves, their property &amp; community. yet the left-wing mayor has made them the bad ones in this... its humiliation!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews I hope we are talking about how it goes BOTH ways, not just gay to straight therapy. straight to gay conversion therapy is far more prevalent in the west &amp;  is far more damaging because it involves pumping pubescent kids fully of harmful hormone blockers before they understand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews Urged only by the very people who sympathise with them obviously. Meanwhile, the majority of us normal people see this and feel ashamed of how weak we are as a society &amp; people to allow this shit.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@opfirestorm @LBC @TheSpurrShow People are so much easier to control when they're divided. And the left are very easily manipulated.

<|startoftext|>@LBC @TheSpurrShow NO, thats some major BS! we live in the hight of a society where playing the victim is incredibly advantageous, claim you're of an oppressed ’minority’ &amp; you're fast tacked for jobs etc. Of course, they will exaggerate racial issues, it gives them so much power &amp; we cant question<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good for them. If I was in school now I 100% GUARANTEE I would be pulled aside &amp; told I've been ’assessed’ during class &amp; my pubescent self isn't right, so before letting me develop through puberty naturally, they'd push me into taking hormone blockers &amp; adle my pubescent brain😬<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BBCWorld trust the BBC to bring this down to a race issue... shes just a girl who likes Irish dancing.  how can you make this a racial issue while in the same breath saying how "OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE" the response was yet you literally ignore that and focus on "A FEW" negative comments?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews In my experience, polls are never accurate. They just seem to always be a morale boost for the left to make them think they are winning to inflate their egos. In society it is made to look as if the left are popular &amp; win at everything but in reality they flop almost every time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickygervais To freely argue nowadays is rare. Dare to question or debate something and you will be cancelled. Just look at the new ’hate speech’ laws the SNP are trying to impose on Scotland. If they vote to pass the new laws, I honestly fear for the Scottish people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews Get over it ffs... its a memorial to a dog from a time different time.  it was literally the dog's name, I don't really give a shit if someone CHOOSES to be offended, that was the dog's name. you can't just erase history. removing it's name is the same as spitting on its grave.🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A damn disgrace. the British people have never been so united in their disdain &amp; disgust for this girl... Yet the courts/authorities side with the traitor. If she does worm her way back, it should be straight into a cell on a charged of high treason. Reinstate the treason act👍🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andyn63 @SkyNews Oh make no mistake, she's coming back to a very very cushy life... she will be treated better than the Queen by the authorities, they won't be able to do enough for her &amp; she will have benefits out the arse.

<|startoftext|>@LBCNews @afneil, arguably one of the greatest interviewers on TV is just chucked aside. meanwhile, Gary Lineker is sat there on well over £1,000,000 a year just for talking about men kicking footballs around a field... it's embarrassing &amp; rather disgraceful...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@verokins @Sion67_ as i imagine you disgust him also... just because you are disgusted, didn't mean your views are right/better.  He has the right to voice his views, it isn't exactly forcing you to comply with them, he just filled in a little bullet point tweet going around. you can do it too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCWorld is that not literal fascism?...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews but... its literally a fact? besides, BLM doesn't care that the number of black Americans killing black Americans are far higher. supporters of BLM have killed a number of black people since Georges murder and because they weren't killed by white people they kept real quiet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is he happy now?. lets take note of how less the virgin internet cuts out now🤣. while he was throwing a tantrum about not getting taxpayer money from the government, his virgin internet was going down at least once every 2 weeks for a few hours. my theory is it was deliberate🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Stop_The_Panic @sustrapperazzi_ I’ve never seen any of his arguments be based on colour. So the whole racist thing is kinda, meh🤷🏻‍♂️.

<|startoftext|>@CarlaSpade @BenIrvineAuthor OK. go inhale someone's COVID juice&amp; wait until you get so ill that you won't need a mask, test or vaccine because you'd likely be dead because you didn't want help because you think you're being controlled🤣, whilst tweeting on social media, the biggest controller of society.🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenIrvineAuthor Evil &amp; humiliating🤣 no, It’s just sensible during a pandemic, we wont have to wear face masks forever, stop being hysterical. We’ve been in lockdown for 3+ months, you can’t get anymore antisocial. And i’ll tell you what is unhealthy... catching COVID. Your priorities are wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Yes, we know... for the thousandth fucking time... WE KNOW. It’s not news and we literally don’t care about two kids we don’t know. we couldn’t care less that they are getting married. They will be devorced with in 2 years then you can have that ‘news’ on repeat for a week too...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenIrvineAuthor Christ, it's hardly a massive sacrifice, is it?...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only a mug would politician drinking mugs...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DVATW Just wear a damn mask... really isn’t a big deal, it’s a minuscule &amp; temporary sacrifice, no point in getting upset about. It’s a necessary step in getting back to normal &amp; the economy churning again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews And the money went where exactly?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews BuT tHaTs AgEiSt! Not to mention it is also discrimination and she must stand aside to allow an actual chicken to play the role, she is sick for even considering to reprise the role while so many chickens loose out on work! DISGUSTING!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Well it’s just pointless making a damn sequel then. squals are set AFTER the previous film, so of course her voice will be older. A sequel of a voice acted film after so long without the main characters original voice will ruin the nostalgia for a lot of people. It’s silly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCWorld It’s only facing a boycott because the way you have reported it... you slyly reported it in a way in which you’re basically calling on people to boycott the food brand... you know how people on the left are sheep and once they see this headline they will be like “BoYcOtT gOyA!”🤪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews Was only a matter of time until some dickhead took George Floyd’s genuine call for help &amp; mimicked it &amp; took the piss to get out of a situation.

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews wonder how many patients have died unnecessarily in hosptial because the nurse or doctor etc were just those few minutes too late to the bed side because they had to go pay for another parking ticket.

<|startoftext|>@lewisdandrews so basically we're teaching about the past 5-ish years? because 98% of these genders/sexualities literally never existed until wokeness kicked off around 5-6 years ago. this will without a doubt be vigorously pushed on kids with intent of indoctrination, rather than education.🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>

There was nothing racist about it. She can try play victim all she likes, she's only embarrassing herself &amp; her image.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sophieloux__ ikr, 've spent most of the past 3 days off this shit and it is actually so relieving 🤣. particularly with how much twitter is a toxic echo chamber, it genuinely feels good to stay off it 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Yeah but it’s just the flu over there, it’s fine. he will be right as rain in a few days.......... 🤪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@halleberry you ain't this BS made up 'cisgender'... you are a straight woman. don't let 0.1% of people suddenly decide to erase your sexuality &amp; create some degrading 'cis' label. stand up for yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@halleberry you lost far more respect for apologising than you gained for apologising.   it is literally your job to ACT as other people and should be free to do so...   actor?... more like pandor, am i right?😀 HAHAHAHA...😐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ughh... why apologise? you are an actor, IT IS LITERALLY YOUR JOB TO PRETEND TO BE OTHER PEOPLE AND 90+% ARE FICTIONAL CHARACTERS TOO!, THEY ARENT EVEN REAL!! you're an ACTOR, you can ACT as anyone you want as long as you're a talented actor, otherwise, films just gonna be bad.🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@estherk_k huh? anyone can get cancer, no matter how fit &amp; healthy they are. Being fit &amp; healthy certainly helps to fight &amp; kill off cancerous cells before they grow but cancer could still occur.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaronCarter @agw1437 @ChristieLinford you are clearly confusing American police with UK police. they are incomparable. the recent behaviour of our police (UK police) is comedic, literally running away, kneeling and knocking themselves off their horses...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChristieLinford where is the racism in this clip exactly? they ask the guy to get out the car, to search for a WEAPON. and the woman in the car freaking out makes the situation 10x worse, scaring her child far more than the cops ever would, she is instilling a false fear of cops into her child.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>oh fuck me, China needs to sort its fucking self out instead of crying about Hong-kong independence, a few mountains next to India &amp; panic building island in the SC sea while buying up all the shares of all the crashing markets around the world due to their last fucking disease!.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowthisnews that's a YOU problem, not a trump problem. the American baldheaded eagle has been a symbol of America for decades! you are just looking for excuses to casue problems where there is none to stir up hate and division... literally divide &amp; conquer tactics, its pathetic &amp; sad.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@negroprogrammer don't like the term blacklist? yet you love to blacklist users... blacklisting is no different from shadow banning... just its a lot darker in the shadows (in other words, at least people know when you've been blacklisted).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eszara_ @TwitterEng same bollocks too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>yet to see a single comment or retweet in support of this utter BOLLOCKS!...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews @BorisJohnson people are legit attacking &amp; criticizing Boris for getting tongue-tied over 2 words... as if it never happened to them in life too. 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews @BorisJohnson OMG, he got tongue-tied, he is definitely hiding some disease or terminal illness!  put it in the front page!... we must all know about the 'growing concerns' of the PM's health...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews I'm sure there is a common denominator for all this... just can't quite put my finger on it.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dexerto reckful, on the other hand, never did anything to warrant trolling, he was a kind soul with deep mental health issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dexerto she is using Reckful's suicide as an opportunity to play victim. she is an opportunist, from 'copy strike pewdiepie' to openly admitting marriage fraud to get a green card. its all had selfish malicious intent &amp; she faces no consequences &amp; shows no remorse, hence why shes trolled<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlotteCGill the left wont learn how cancerous cancel culture is on society until they experience it themselves. only the left has this magic power to cancel people. the only way it will stop is if they taste their own medicine. once they're CC victims too, they will soon campaign to stop it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCWorld Read the damn article before you start crying 'BrItiAn Is StEaLiNg! DaMn CoLonIaLiSt ThIeVeS!', idiots. if you knew the situation, you'd understand why the UK denied Maduro access. he is a cruel tyrant &amp; is starving his people, they would never see the money with him in charge...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Twitch at least a plaque or statue of Reckful sitting on a bench or even at a streaming setup should be put up outside twitch HQ in his memory. as a pioneer of streaming, without him, many streamers &amp; the industry itself will not be where it is today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealSaleemJuma @MarkDice apparently according to BLM, black people are all one &amp; their home is nowhere but Africa (even if they never been/born there). So surely she sees her home as Asia? Why doesn't she want to go and liberate her people suffering in Hong Kong? Instead of threatening to stab people😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The priest is just a cuck, Christianity is dying out in western society. When's the last time a church was built? They can't even find funds for repairs. Christianity is a choice nowadays unlike Islam which is mandatorily drilled into you from birth. &amp; Kehinde just hates Britain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's the left creating racial divisions for their cultural Marxist revolution. They are using black people as a means to an end. This guy is exactly right, the black depiction of Jesus is literally just a token by white (cultural Marxist) to fuel their cultural revolution BS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you can just start to pick &amp; choose what race Jesus was like it's a damn twitter trend &amp; not be challenged harshly, just shows how meaningless religion is now. We are now trying to literally change Christianity to appease BLM. They will want God on his knees nexts🤦‍♂️🏻🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews of course, the change will happen and of course, he will win the election... why we playing games?... the outcome was obvious before it began.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexand_erleon you're just chatting shit mate. next, you will be mouthing off about white men (as usual) are sexist or some BS because some don't find obese women attractive... or you will stoop lower and moan not enough men are shagging blue-haired woman. YOU CAN NOT FORCE ATTRACTION...🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetimes literally, couldn't care less. the whole George Floyd problem is an issue specific to America, not here. anyone calling for the change is basically saying black people are the devil. whereas us normal people see a saint defeating satan... because that is literally what is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @eddiemair this vile woman is one of the biggest reasons it took so long to sort Brexit... she didn't get her way &amp; even lost her seat because of her vile &amp; disgraceful behaviour. why on earth you even gave her the time of day is beyond me, she's a washed-up disgrace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews so practically a very large majority on the left, especially those Marxist anarchists are banned then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 @MPSHomerton i mean... if they are doing their job and have the right warrants &amp; intel etc and are keeping the wider public safe, a few kicked-in doors &amp; fewer criminals on the streets doesn't exactly seem like such a bad thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCWorld get fucked if you think I will ever vote for someone for their colour...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MKBHD its going to be aids. will not even be about youtube.. nothing has gone viral on youtube this year... so it will just be a bunch of left-wing propaganda with the overall theme being COVID and it will only feature black YouTubers with 100 subs of less because they "aren't heard"🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCWorld what is hate speech &amp; who decides?...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanielBostock4  https://t.co/wixpxCyTiX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreitbartLondon arent they the perfect type of people to have as your special forces? their No.1 goal is to protect Germany... who else is better for the job than nationalists... no need to disband them. its only a few that have gone over the line... its hardly the coming for the 4th Reich... 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews oh, fuck off. go look at the black lives matters UK website... 90% is all a political agenda. they literally want to dismantle an entire political system! you can't get any more political. I will tell you what isn't political... wearing a poppy in memory of our fallen in war!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>something we must all get behind.  it's no longer about equality, but superiority.  the genuine argument is being lost &amp; the cultural Marxists anarchists are corrupting &amp; manipulating everything. it was a police brutality issue which is becoming a cultural Marxist revolution...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TarekFatah probably attacked themselves again by accident like the time they humiliated themselves out of WW3 after they shot down one of their civilian airliners thinking it was an American fighter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCWorld as if there was ever going to be another option other than Putin LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews basically, if your opinion deviates from the left's narrative it is hate speech. it's only the right who can ever be guilty of hate speech &amp; its the left who are the only ones who can ever enforce speech censorship on social media because big tech is run by the left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews has biology been erased from history or something?... scientific facts beat opinions and feelings at every turn. your opinions &amp; feelings do not mean as much as literal facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetroUK it's not a claim, it's literally a fact...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews get a damn grip for christ sake... honestly pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>China must be held to account. it has a complete disregard for cleanliness &amp; hygiene. it's a breeding ground for so many diseases &amp; its the whole world which has to suffer. China couldn't care less if their diseases affect other nations, it's an opportunity China can exploit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews i mean, he wasn't wrong. weak &amp; lack of courage is a huge understatement of Theresa may premiership. dread to think what her handling of corona would've been like...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thedrunkenfool @SkyNews thats not how twitch works. their record of unfair &amp; unjustified bans hurts their rep a lot, they likely took a hit for this. the platform is mainly gaming &amp; most viewers will just meme that the presidents banned on a gaming site &amp; won't care that its blatant political meddling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simpson_anton @SkyNews I'd argue Joe Biden doesn't even know what day it is anymore. like burnie sanders, Joe is physically unfit for office before even being elected to office and in joes case, mentally unfit also.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Christ... its literally political meddling by big tech. banning a political candidate from a platform is like banning them from a town square. never moan that government is controlling/manipulating you, they dont, its big tech, i.e. social media companies who hold the real power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews is really trying to push the narrative that the white couple are the bad guys in this trivial standoff. they were well within their right to protect their private property on their gated private road. the mob was literally trespassing &amp; intent on graffitiing the area.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews they had every right to point guns, it's their private property &amp; private road... protesters shouldn't have been there anyway, they were just looking for trouble. those protesters would've no doubt vandalised those homes with various graffiti if they weren't warned off with guns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrdrowzy @SkyNews I'm white and in no way do the majority of white people represent me at all. so why is it the case with POC &amp; the need to group them based on colour? obviously, there will be less POC in western media... the west is majority white, what you expect?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrdrowzy @SkyNews representation of what exactly?... skin colour? we keep hearing 'RePrEsEnTaTiOn' but what does it actually mean? Sounds racist to me, using POC as tokens. just because someone is the same colour, doesn't mean they represent all POC. there is more to people than just a colour...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@T4AB14 @nymnion @drdisrespect Nothing is too long ago for MeToo🤣. I thought it was a MeToo thing but the last 8 mins of his stream he was talking about being a fan of a major conspiracist called David icke &amp; encouraged views to watch. gov/authorities get weird about conspiracies. Doc is deep in that gulag🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nymnion @drdisrespect what if the leaks are true &amp; Doc did cheat on his wife with a massive female streamer &amp; its true twitch is protecting her. who is the most protected female streamer on Twitch? ALINITY!... maybe she sees the streamer MeToo scandal &amp; wants in on some drama so changed her story KEKW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrdrowzy @SkyNews we are talking about voice ACTING, their job is to literally act like other people... if you think actors voicing cartoon characters is racist because they don't look like the character then you are the problem. there is no racist intent in voice acting. CONTEXT MATTERS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paddyfandango @prolloyd1 @SkyNews @TheSimpsons the majority wanted him to continue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bill19831 @SkyNews I don't think they realise they have just put hundreds of VOICE actors out of work because their physical skin colour isn't acceptable... there is a word for that but I can't quite put my finger on it...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wookdewook @Chriswilts17 @SkyNews the 'white man' has to get on their knees and apologize to Eddie for forcing him to play such a degrading and dehumanising role.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Its fucking VOICE acting!!🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ since when has voice ever had colour?!  You're now going to put hundreds of VOICE ACTORS out for work because of their skin colour... this is literal racism. Will animals voice cartoon animals now? will an alien voice Roger (American dad) now too?🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrdrowzy @SkyNews since when has voice ever had colour, fool. stopping voice actors from voicing CARTOONS because the voice actors skin colour is unacceptable is literally racism... will we now get a dog to play brian in Family guy? or maybe an actual alien to voice Roger from American dad...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wormgrinder @TVGuide its a cartoon... the only thing that should be represented is good voice acting... they are there for their voice, nothing more.   voice has no colour.  I guess aliens &amp; other fantasy characters etc will all be cut from cartoons until they too have real-life representation...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>oh great... I don't really want to remember the details of the time I was completely powerless to stop my identity &amp; my nations identity, culture, heritage &amp; history be erased &amp; torn down. 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just fuck off. these talk shows know damn well 90% of the stories they peddle are false... they create this exaggerated bollocks to cause outrage so they can capitalise off the viral clips. unfortunately this shit they peddle snowballs in leftist minds, making them go further...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews lol, people literally aren't interested in clapping for the NHS anymore... it's not the lastest trend to brag about on social media, #clapforNHS is so last month... the latest trends are anti-white, anti-police  anti-gov, pro-anarchy, cultural Marxism... oh &amp; slavery apparently🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @TomSwarbrick1 is a damn disgrace and absolutely disgusting!... and what's more disgusting is the fact his girlfriend has been fired too, in a time like this, for something that literally ISNT a crime! AND they tried to force her to take a brainwashing course to changer her thinking!  PATHETIC!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>just get a damn grip already...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>fuck me, can we clam down on the hysteria... getting way of hand. wtf do you need an FBI investigation to see that it was blatantly not a noose? you didnt even clear the detail up... because fuck white people, lets keep them looking bad, you are after a race war after all... scum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stonewalluk must be depressing being reduced to nothing more than a single letter of a huge diluted group that defines people based on their sexuality/gender then groups them all up (excluding straight people). just imagine having your identity reduced to nothing more than a + sign. how sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews just ban white people...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews you are not entitled to a job based on your colour. what will having a perfect ratio of each 'race' in every job achieve? we are supposed to be progressing, not regressing. you want a managerial job? work hard, put the effort in the skills &amp;qualifications needed, take initiative!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NHSMillion you won't get followers by begging for them... lol. I bet you even got her more followers than yourself by promoting her with your rant about her having more followers than you, lmao. (before she was permabanned obviously)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews there is a word for condemning white lives... I believe it is called racist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaheemKassam people need to stop talking about slavery as if they are still slaves themselves... b*tch please, you ain't no slave, you never have been &amp; never will be. quit crying about something long since abolished and short your attitude out. its not slavery holding you back, its yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC how the f**k does some random MP know that?... and why the f**k is he the one to 'confirm' it and not the police? its just labour jumping in to protect yet more immigrant criminals... guess you can't blame them for wanting to protect the minuscule voter base they have left.🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justiceforjohn @LBC pretty sure that's one of Antifa's mottos/ warnings... 🤣 their hate for the police &amp; their desire to defund and abolish them would give them great pleasure in making the pigs (cops) fly in a number of ways...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCWorld lol, the more the media posts, the more they prove trump right.  'comfort-blanket' is just direct media bias.  you go instantly for the anti-trump rhetoric to attack him &amp; downplay or exaggerate things about him depending on what you can smear/discredit/embarrass him with most 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Americans, in general, may have ignorant &amp; arrogant attitudes toward the virus but its obvious people, even some Americans, are still aware of the fact we are in a pandemic &amp; know its folly to join a rally in person, whosever it is. online, however, viewer numbers where massive.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews is that really the best option you could have chosen lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snb19692 got here because of you lefty lots BS🤣... especially the past 4 years, making everything harder so nothing got done. as for this year, no one expected a Pandemic, it has thrown the entire world off &amp; into a mess for this year and likely most of next year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HotelLubyanka @DawkinsReturns @MOB51 you are still responsible for all of history and you must bend the knee and repent your sins! SAY SORRY! 😡😡😡 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brw51 @SeanMcNamara750 @dogsmakesense @BritishHistorym @DawkinsReturns yes, British, exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawkinsReturns agreed. though losing The Revolutionary War was pretty embarrassing, also the break up of the empire stung a bit🤣... we did end slavery though and our royal navy spent decades ensuring others followed suit, so there is that small deed at least🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@covid69420 @Xbox oh dear, that's embarrassing...  https://t.co/cEFcYGlnO0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenJolly9 compare the state of London with Boris as mayor to the state of London with Sadiq khan as mayor... London without a doubt is far worse off &amp; run-down with crime out of control with Sadiq in charge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hrespresso @BenJolly9 surely the 20,000 police cuts is a dream come true for you, surprised you aren't calling on him to cut more or abolish the police altogether🤣 khans spending priorities haven't exactly priorities the police either, lmao.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@godblesstoto the sad thing is they don't even give you a description of what the films are even about now...they're just like 'Hey, heads up, this shit is outdated so don't take these fictional films seriously otherwise you could become racist or have a break down after watching this, ENJOY!'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@godblesstoto almost all these movies are based on/set in fiction...  christ, if you are sad enough find fiction offensive... literally imagination, offensive... you need to be imminently put into a psych ward because you are schizophrenic or some shit and you need serious help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyCinemaUK sad cunts. 🤡🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 It honestly makes me feel sick... The vast majority of us want our culture, heritage, history and statues LEFT ALONE!!! I feel so degraded, so demoralized, so helpless that I can not do or say anything to stop it as me &amp; my country's identity is erased before my eyes... No hope😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Let's not get ahead of yourselves &amp; start arresting cops for the slightest thing to make it look like you are doing something.  they clearly had a right to shoot, he stole a tazer but shouldn't have shot to kill, literally no point... He he was drunk so he wasn't gonna get far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews Islam's got a real thing for terrorism🙄... Maybe time to have a little word about that instead of trying to erase British culture, history &amp; identity... Makes me sick.  It feels like worse crime to be British than a terrorist... That's honestly how the media makes it feel...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews @HillaryClinton @KayBurley Pretty sure she died soon after the election... she disappeared for a while then popped back up randomly looking half dead with a different facial structure, as you can see^. it must take a while for a lizard to get comfortable in their new skin. 🤣😂☹️😆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Xbox wtf is that😬  it goes from a PS2 startup sound to a bag of shingle to a pair of scissors or a knife being dragged along a brick wall...  such a dirty sound.  https://t.co/tTBBzcLW3j<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews they banned the use of the poppy on their shirts because it was "too political", did they not?... yet they will plaster a corrupt politically motivated Marxist organisation which uses &amp; manipulates the black communities. might as well just put ANTIFA across your backs...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews £900,000 is literally nothing in the grand scheme of things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WileyCEO I doubt that... the Europeans were far more advanced than Africans in many ways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WileyCEO if we are all going to think like this then we'd all be back living in Africa... the entire human race literally started in East Africa.  you telling black people "this ain't ya home" because some ancestors they never knew were sold into slavery just creates silly division.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>can you not? @NorthKoreaDPRK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WileyCEO okay then. if thats your thinking, go back to this other home of yours and start building it up, get rid of the warlords, build infrastructure etc instead of sitting here with your feet up for the past 40+ years... maybe have a word with those who willingly sold you into slavery.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawkinsReturns maybe they should take a leaf out of the book of North Korean defectors or middle eastern illegal immigrants... and either escape or flee from this terrible island, I'm sure they can find some dinghies littered across the south coast abandoned by illegal immigrants to escape on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>absolute disgrace and I bet even those who warn about illegal immigration &amp; how many are here will get a shock if we ever bother to find out just how many illegal immigrants are actually here...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews watch the full thing... they literally deserved to get shot, they attacked him first and tried to swamp him... he had every right to defend himself, they only have their cocky selves to blame. sort yourself out will you, you completely ignore that fact...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC "no foreign interference" but Facebook itself will most certainly manipulate and interfere...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DefenceHQ OH COOL!!, now get those boats with their newly serviced &amp; polished engines in the channel and protect our damn border for once...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gamingbible mobile game!?... ight, imma head out...  I'm still waiting for the 3rd LOTR: The Battle for Middle-earth game...  https://t.co/MwPwx1e9rk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>no shit sherlock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews okay, but let's be honest here... how many people of ALL colours are killed with chokeholds from cops? if police cant restrains someone, they're just more likely to start popping shots off instead lol.  i personally think a chokehold ban will actually make things more dangerous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1daresnakes Hitchens be like...  https://t.co/TAwY0wsgsa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iromg I've yet to see anyone from the 'other side' be arrested &amp; sent to prison and plastered over BBC News twitter feed every 2 hours for the next 3 days talking about how despicable they are for vandalising &amp; tearing down statues &amp; beating people. just feels like no equal justice😩  https://t.co/cVmlVecHF7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>so the left was wrong, WW3 wasn't going to be trumps fault with the US vs Iran... it's their commie Chinese friends starting it by pushing in on India... taking full advantage of the chaos in the world with the virus. we also got their puppet state, north Korea playing up too🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not now!... Please... For christ sake, NOT NOW!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomas29472 @SkyNews sorry, I just miss understood the joke.  I get what she was saying now... racism is 'bone-deep' because bones are WHITE!  I get it now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CherrieHere @YouTube  https://t.co/RWrlVuUWMv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouTube they work fine for them. isnt it to be up to the viewers to watch what THEY want to watch, not what YOU want them to? i see no reason to 'amplify' specific people just because they have the same skin colour as a man who was killed in a certain country.  you are a global platform.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews LOL! that's some bull shiitttt.  https://t.co/zfOEYjcFAK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@calebsivyer notice how the British passionately celebrate St Georges day and never moan about him being Turkish?... notice how its the left bringing up the subject of race/ nationality, yet again... they are obsessed, constantly bringing up peoples race &amp; colour etc... its all they see.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>sorry, humans are too busy bickering about trivial things like what colours they are, banning comedy &amp; erasing their history &amp; culture because a tiny minority of them want to punish those today for actions of others in the past... we have no time for communicating with aliens🤡👽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HERE'S AN IDEA:  DONT RENAME IT, YOU PATHETIC CUNTS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @LBCNews if she is found alive, there won't be much point in her going home now, like what's the point 🤣 what is she gonna do? go back to a house she won't remember to a family she basically never knew?... if she does, wait until she finds out it was her parents who did it all to her🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson YOU MUST TAKE THIS STANCE! don't you dare give in and bow down &amp; allow a vocal &amp; tiny minority of hateful anarchists to erase us from history &amp; tears down &amp; desecrate our statues &amp; memorials &amp; cancel our culture! Boris, stand with the many, don't kneel to the few.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>justice must be done equally or there is no justice at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snb19692 ECHO... ECHO... ECHO... ECHO... ECHO... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>imagine someone asking who inspires you and you turn around and say DIANE ABBOTT... 🤣🤪🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SadiqKhan Really wanking yourself off over this ain't you... You seem to forget, violence from the other side was far worse. And your lax condemnation of the events last week was like a parent telling off their favourite child. you then decided to join them in tearing down our statues!😠<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You are trying far too hard to not look guilty of removing it on purpose... You look 1000x more guilty than before. Please stop and just apologise for being pathetic instead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon @hopenothate And what of ANTIFA?... the puppet masters of BLM, they hijacket it and ruined what it tried to achieve. They are the reason the so called far right came out yesterday. antifa are baiting a false race war as they try to erase the identity of my country &amp; it’s cultural heritage. 😒<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>lmao. I want to watch over trumps shoulder as he tweets, I imagine it is fascinating...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lunaperla @snb19692 @montie half the stuff you listed either didn't happen or you are just confusing those you say did some of those things with those who actually did them. here is some context of the other sides actions.  https://t.co/Eb4WD2TtuN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/dKOKLIynBs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>0:35 man literally said "mission failed, we'll (try and) get 'em next time"  don't disgrace call of duty like that, you disgrace yourself and your cause enough by 40 of you dogpiling one man and stomping his skull into the pavement...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JusticeTill @SadiqKhan a screenshot from a video is not evidence of nazi salutes. people raising their hands above their head is not a nazi salute, those out today were primarily football lads, their raised hands are to do with football chanting, not nazis... go to a football game &amp; you'll understand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>essentially what they mean is, 'sorry history happened, we will start burning books as soon as possible! we are so sorry we didn't do this sooner!'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_daryqueen @mattuthompson @JavierMunoz123 @LBCNews @LBC jokes on you. Trump doesn't have a say who we let into the UK. 🤣🤪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC its cool, you can stop crying about "the green being littered with cans" now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>this kind of talk is literally racism...  if you want to defeat racism then you need to realise it's not just whites capable of racism. calling white people Gammons &amp; pork IS racism. if you don't see that or refuse to acknowledge that, don't you dare claim you are 'anti-racism'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't remember nazi salutes ever being 2 handed. also, if this is a riot, god knows what the violence last weekend was...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imjustbait just looks like a large game of slapies compared to last week...😂 🙎‍♂️🤚✋👮‍♂️ could be worse, they could be popping fireworks directly at police and throwing Boris bikes at them... 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>agreed, but the police literally never help themselves, these lot wouldn't be out today if the police protected our cultural identity, statues &amp;war memorials etc. this is what happens when you degrade &amp; demoralise an entire nation &amp; its people constantly, tension begins to flare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ruptly lol, of course, Antifa are there, popping fireworks again and throwing smoke bombs at the ones out wanting to protect their cultures sites to agitate things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>who the f**k seriously wants to live in a CANCEL CULTURE!?? I've never felt so distressed, demoralised &amp; degraded the past few days as I've watched my country's culture, heritage, history &amp; identity be desecrated, vandalised &amp;cancelled by people driven by real hatred for my home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EAStarWars i can just tell it will just be dirty backwards &amp; overly complicated &amp; awkward flight controls like those in battlefront 2 and games like Battlefield.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewStadlen @LBC that fact you even tweeted this is pathetic.  funny, even on here, the biggest lefty cespit on the internet, they don't agree with such a suggestion. not to mention the continuous battering of white brits for a past they had no part in utterly demoralising for Britain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SadiqKhan its the extreme far-left (ANTIFA!!!) doing the hijacking, idiot. if the right is the ones hijacking &amp; tearing down&amp; vandalising their own cultural &amp; historical sites, why are they specifically coming out to PROTECT those very things being destroyed? FOOL, its YOU sowing division.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lazybastarandy Me personally, probably not. But if we had a 2nd amendment, just think how bad London would be... A majority of the past 2 years of stabbings in London would have been shootings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@addicted2newz careful, that is lefty hypnosis.  https://t.co/JlxoNKfTPC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RomeoKomTrikru @DefundBBC lol honestly, they have cancelled so many programs &amp; films the past few days, someone with enough money could actually just buy up all the cancelled shows &amp; films and create a non PC streaming service🤣🤣.  something I would honestly pay good money for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlooThistle @DefundBBC Well, they're not far off book-burning, I assume they will start microwaving CDs &amp; DVDs soon after that :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>don't mention the war? more like don't mention the comedy, 🤣am I right? eh!? eh!? yeah😒... comedy isn't my strong suit... f*ck it, ban all comedy! REEEEEE!...😂... but seriously, fuck the BBC, absolute embarrassment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the answer is OUR statue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @TomSwarbrick1 get a fucking grip!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, fuck off 😀<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I see actors acting, nothing more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>we said no!. she literally said she doesn't regret a thing, she feels no remorse at all whatsoever!.. you really think she'd come back begging to be let in if her beloved califate wasn't destroyed? no, she'd be more than happy to continue pumping out little ISIS babies. #BeGone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>maybe demilitarize the average American too... no need for anything bigger than a pistol.  then maybe the police will go a lot easier knowing there isn't a chance they could have a damn military-grade assault rifle with armour piercing rounds pulled on them at a traffic stop😂🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>mhmm, because editing &amp; posting stuff like this will definitely help heal race relations &amp; divisions etc...🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iwilldrainu @kindapopular "look like this"?... you only want them because of their skin colour/ethnicity. that is literally the only reason you are choosing them... to be your little virtue signalling tokens. you lefty lot constantly picking &amp; judging everyone &amp; everything based on skin colour.🥱🥱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@problem_we She's not exactly a good role model to inspire people... If she does inspire you... I'm so sorry for you... 😆😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MortalitasAmare @AndyJB1988 @SJRogue @semenhitler @Chinchillazllla @darrengrimes_ And the black cop killed by rioters in US? you are confusing America's situation with the UK’s. We haven't used tear gas or rubber bullets here... But thanks to people importing America's problems to the UK to cause division, people are now attacking &amp; throwing bikes etc at cops.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews We are coming out of lockdown too fast, the government doesn't seem to care about the measures since the BLM. It doesn't bloody matter now. No one is bothering to care about there being a pandemic... So F it... Cough some COVID juice in my mouth already... Come at me, 2nd wave!🙌🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brilliant 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Ooooh, f**king hell, they're ballsy... Basically feeding him to the wolves😆. Is it smart to be reporting this too? You know there will be people who want him dead... You are just inviting people to hunt him down lol. Now a very angry mob will gather outside his house day &amp; night<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nypost  https://t.co/1W1uKdBCky<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews this is what happens when leftie cultural Marxist anarchists import &amp; inflate an American police brutality problem into the UK and exaggerate it so they can sow division &amp; set back race relations in the UK for years all for their own political gain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>honestly, I think it's true, I was seriously ill around November like I've never been before and all the symptoms were COVID symptoms. since then my lungs haven't fully recovered, can't take as deep a breath as I used to and my eye sight has definitely got worse since...😷😟<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@artisticatty i was petty damn ill in November with pretty bad COVID symptoms. the whole house got it mild but I was serious, high fever, couldn't eat for 3+weeks, insane night sweats the dirtiest cough and unbearable chest/rib pain, lungs filled with gunk, could barely breathe. coincidence?😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HRC isn't the whole point of being 'trans' to transition from one gender to the other?... surely once they have completed the transition period they have officially become the other gender? so why would you need "trans-inclusive" feminism if all trans woman are women and vice-versa😆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@problem_we of course, the highest number of people saying 'they should' is also the age range of those most easily influenced 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>this is why we should not just start to teardown &amp; desecrate our own statues &amp; monuments. sheep have no clue whats going on... they go where the one in front goes and they only do it when there is attention on social media so they can feel important on the latest bandwagon...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NickFlaks @LBC perhaps not...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Starmer on his knee, a leader of a party also on it's knees🤣...

<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon you are actually vile. what's next?, book burning?

<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan well, she's kinda right?... no point fighting a ghost. no one looked at the statue &amp; felt proud about slavery or felt inspired to pursue a career in it. tearing down statues wont change history or 'fix' it. the statue was there as a reminder, not a glorification or celebration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MortalitasAmare @AndyJB1988 @SJRogue @semenhitler @Chinchillazllla @darrengrimes_ it's really not a big deal, 1 horse lost its nerve. even the most rigorously trained soldiers can still lose their nerve. a loud crowd is nothing compared to the wars etc horses were used in over the past 2000+ years but they can still lose their nerve lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TwitchSupport @Twitch companies have noticed the massive increase in traffic on twitch &amp; seen streamers flourishing during the lockdown. they want a slice of the pie, squeezing out every penny they can. twitch may be popping atm but can its integrity take much more of the restrictions &amp; suppression?😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MortalitasAmare @AndyJB1988 @SJRogue @semenhitler @Chinchillazllla @darrengrimes_ horses have been used in protests &amp; riots for crowd control for years. you &amp; others are quick to call for horses to stop being used &amp; they shouldn't have been there etc, yet if the protesters were people you didn't agree with you'd all be the first to call for the horses🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews oh yes, this is going to work so well... defiantly won't be criminals &amp; gangs preying on the weak/average person because the police ain't a thing anymore. i imagine it as some sparrows shit from Game of thrones 🤣🤦‍♂️🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the most violence I've seen towards police since a terrorist killed an officer at the gates of parliament. and all the police want is a pathetic meaningless apology? lmao, the police have to be trolling... right??  https://t.co/PGNMFxhmI7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SadiqKhan Lmao, funny man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chinchillazllla @darrengrimes_ Wait, I just realised... what if the officer identifies as something else? that means you misgendered the officer twice 😱. And I’m pretty certain it was a traffic light not a ‘light pole’ or lamppost 🤔  https://t.co/nOyMH9JYP7<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@donorsHATEhim @Chinchillazllla @darrengrimes_ 😂Not hard to comprehend a horse can still get scared 😅 You think horses never got scared during the hundreds of years we used them in wars etc...🤪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stereosaur @Chinchillazllla @darrengrimes_ whos saying its the horse's fault? it didn't scare itself. humans have used horsed throughout history for hundreds of years from labour work to wars and you are upset police are using a few of them to crown control &amp; push some rowdy protesters back?🤣🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dreamboum @Legend_Arts this footage is from months ago during the yellow vest protests, not the current BLM protests.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imjustbait a good way for them to lose support, I'm sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoahCarl90 If they keep this kind of behaviour up then they will only haemorrhage support. continuation &amp; escalation of the damaging, defacing &amp; tearing down of our statues &amp; war memorials will only hurt #BlackLivesMatter. that behaviour coupled with Antifa &amp; anarchist hijackers is not good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrRosena I have one in mind who is truly unfit for mayor... that is the current mayor. he has sat back and done nothing but push the blame as he let young black &amp; Asian boys stab each other to death in the hundreds over the past 2 years. and he has the audacity to say black lives matter?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrRosena never mind who the person was... their deed of cleaning the monument was a good deed, doesn't matter who it was who did it, its the deed that matters, not the person.  luckily for you, that person fits into your narrative so you jump on them and ignore the deed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPJHodges no one looked at the statue and suddenly felt inspired to take up slavery. it's obviously not there to glorify slavery, it's there as a reminder of history.  YOU CAN NOT CHANGE OR DENY HISTORY!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geddon_ You are literally antifa, stfu🤣. Your opinion is irrelevant because it's you lot which are ruining it for the #BlackLivesMattters movement... You are using them as a way to deliberately start a fight with governments &amp; cause anarchy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BLMcCallum @Phil_at98 @darrengrimes_ It was a female officer and horse was bolting while she was on the horse. Maybe condemn those who popped a flair in the horses face which made the horse bolt in the first place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chinchillazllla @darrengrimes_ the officer is female &amp; the horse was bolting because a protester poped at flair in it's face and while she lay crippled on the ground protesters threw glass bottles, bricks &amp; even rammed a few Boris bikes into the other horses which could have startled them &amp; trample her.🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyMartin_UK pretty frustrating though when they both think you are their enemy &amp; each side thinks you are on the opposing side to them lol.  https://t.co/fn34kbfUzI<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@davidwalliams @BarackObama he did f*ck all to fight racism lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drdisrespect a lot of it is people doing it for the LOLs. they're literally doing it to meme and be edgy and try to get reactions and because its online in a chat they dont care because there will be no consequences. they just want to spam the most shocking &amp; edgy things they can for the LOLs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sophieloux__ those hills 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews you're killing each other 90% of the time in the UK, maybe have a word with yourselves first. America has some big issues it needs to sort out itself... theres no excuse for the violent protests &amp; selfish looting to come to the UK when the issue is engrained in America itself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@starwars @DsnyPk_StarWars @JohnBoyega lol says the ones who minimised the black man to appease china... hypocrites. and no, now is NOT the time... there is a pandemic which affects us all no matter our skin colour... those officers did murder George and they must/will pay, but not at the cost of a 2nd wave of COVID.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>this is embarrassing &amp; humiliating... not just for the UK but the BLM movement too. how can we take this whole thing seriously when they literally play into their stereotype &amp; mug &amp; attack people. this whole issue is specifically a problem within the US, why start a problem here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews ah yes, you have discovered the true intentions of the virus... you foiled its racist supremacy plot. nothing to do with the fact BEME communities &amp; culture is more close nit and intimate than those pesky white communities &amp; culture...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CallofDuty surely releasing the new season will help keep some people off the streets out of harm's way during the riots, that's only a good thing. many people around the world play COD, why should they missout because of the actions of foolish arrogant Americans not connected to the game.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IainDale Good, no need to consider it and I hope he sticks to his guns &amp; doest give into the media’s bullying &amp; harassment. We need a bit of back home in a government for once in this country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamboultonSKY Oh please, you lot did it to yourselves. Maybe the media shouldn't act so scummy then so the majority if people don't feel that way, just a thought. and maybe if the media industry genuinely started trying to sort itself out people could start to regain some faith in it...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SadiqKhan you realise after lockdown roads will be extra clogged, right? congestion will skyrocket, especially with your bright idea to thin London's narrow roads... it will create more congestion. people aren't just going to give up their cars for bikes. change habits, not roads...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmmaKennedy if cummings is forced to resign then so should half the UK be too, surely? vast numbers ignored Boris's plea to stay home. but those who should be 'done' are those reckless journalists... few masks, no gloves and no social distancing whatsoever. far far worse than what he did...  https://t.co/my02qWmH7v<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 nice, targetted harassment is always the answer. anyone breaking lockdown is an idiot but to demand he resigns is pathetic considering half the UK ignored lockdown too. its about who he is, not what he did. i'd argue the journalists swarming over him at his car was 1000x worse!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Four_Four_Stu people aren't comparing the people... they are comparing &amp; highlighting the continuing trend of targeted harassment by the media.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews of course, he would wait to reveal it until this day &amp; age where race-baiting &amp; playing victim is the norm. coming out with it now just stirs resentment. he knows full well 50 years ago the world was very different... that stuff was the norm why try using it now to create outrage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SlimJosa Who is the ‘us’ exactly?... sounds to me like you’re just trying to take credit for something others have achieved just because they identify the same way as you as if you're some kind of hive mind. your self-identification is likely the only thing in common so there is no “us”😆<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@George_Osborne FYI, the tax does nothing but make people struggle with shopping budgets. If you think a few extra pennies on sugar products will stop obeasity then you are dumb AF.

<|startoftext|>@DVATW fine to do this in the middle east where its the norm but in the UK where its not the norm, the call to prayer shouldnt be allowed. the excessive wailing in the middle of a residential area every day is ridiculous &amp; obnoxious. just ring bells like churches do, far less annoying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DVATW this is just dumb. masks/face covering may not be 100% effective but they will obviously lower the chance of the virus transmission. i dont get why people are so arsey over advice to cover your face around strangers during a pandemic... its hardly a big ask so why take the risk?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TrumpsTaxes theres no racism. he answered her question but she didnt get the answer she wanted so she tried pulling the race card, you literally see her sit back to consider how to act up. there was no sexism either... she was just too slow to respond+the reporter acting up interrupted her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRickyDavila everything about the reporter, except the network she works for (which you failed to mention), is irrelevant... you just want to race bait.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looked to see why Katie Hopkins is trending... turns out its people tweeting about how outraged they are at the fact she is trending... ignorant to the fact they are the reason why. its funny that they're slating her for being hateful while being hateful &amp; vile themselves... 🤦‍♂️🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NHSMillion you cant compare her followers to yours. you &amp; she are vastly different. most of her followers likely support you anyway &amp; a good chunk of her followers are probably people who hate her. followers are irrelevant &amp; getting upset that Katie of all people has more followers is odd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sadiq having a tough time not being able to use is race card on people during lockdown so he has gone after the virus itself saying it's unacceptable that the virus is apparently racist. he's not even trolling either. I just hope they arrest the virus &amp; hold it to account!🤦‍♂️🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews £500m to him is practically nothing🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews People were encouraged to stay home and they didnt listen... Wtf makes you think they will give up their cars after weeks of not using them? Car useage will rocket. If they do choose to bike, there is a 90% chance their bike will be stolen in London by a bunch of roadmen anyway😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>what a surprise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JacquiWilkie2 @Nickpg1 @SocialM85897394 and more will continue to die because people continue to ignore government warnings to stay home. the government can only do so much when people don't listen. everyone has a responsibility during this pandemic but too many people have a selfish 'dont tell me what to do' mentality<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Roppa77 Boris is slacking sure, but by no means has he failed. this death toll is far from solely his fault when people ignore his stay home message to go sunbathing in parks etc because their selfish 'dont tell me what to do' mentality. it takes more than just 1 man to stop the spread.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nickpg1 @SocialM85897394 absent in a time of crisis? the bloke was in ICU for about a week or so because of this virus and is likely still not 100% recovered (body wise, not virus wise).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ytcitraining @DavidLammy their desperation stopped once they passed through multiple safe countries, they just want to get to the one with the most relaxed rules. why else risk crossing the busiest shipping lane in the world? they literally have no reason to flee France, its perfectly safe there... 🤨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@transiness @DavidLammy we are literally the most tolerant nation in the world... that's why they keep coming here. but we should 100% be intolerant towards them trying to enter the UK ILLEGALLY, especially when they have passed through multiple safer nations. there is no reason to cross the channel...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidLammy why are you concerned about one man (+cameraman) on a cliff while there are 10-30 ILLEGAL immigrants a day (we know of) just waltzing on in which are highly likely to be infected with COVID-19? where the hell do they go once they step foot on our shores? why do you MPs allow it!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DVATW the 'dont tell us what to do' mentality is one of the big reasons we are now the worst-hit place in Europe, no one listened. those staying home are not "huddled in fear" they are being sensible &amp; stopping the virus spreading so we can get back to normal quicker...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews All from countries which have vastly weaker healthcare systems, higher poverty and poor living conditions... This making the virus spread earlier in their communities... Or we just going to go with the narrative that the virus is now racist? 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PerezHilton @alicecassell @Adele she's super sexy and all that now but i think i prefer her having some thiccness to her IMO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews I don't like football... so I will 'press X for doubt' on this.  us 'average' people are struggling during this pandemic while these footballers have been barely affected by it as they kick their footballs around &amp; getting paid millions for it &amp; taking no pay cuts of any kind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews it came from a bat in a lab as the 'whoever the fuck' carelessly clocked off work contaminated and went to the wet market literally down the road to buy some dog paws to suck on for dinner. its not about if it came from a lab, its about if the virus was released deliberately...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews New Zealand's entire population is less than half that of London... The entirety of New Zealand has a population density of 45 people per square mile while the UK is 600 sq/m (London is 14,000 per sq/m). NZ is also in a remote part of the world. You literally cant compare them.🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DVATW ever considered the reason there were only 315 deaths yesterday is because we are locked down? if we weren't, the death count/rate would be considerably higher. just because there were fewer deaths than usual doesn't mean we should end the lockdown early &amp; risk a second wave...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews all the suicides and mental health issues the show causes and that was fine, keep it going. but showing them chilling in a villa getting a suntan &amp; shagging while the viewers have to stay inside?... too far my dude!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaeljknowles yes, it is America &amp; yes, stay the fuck indoors...  if you're ignoring the lockdown to get a suntan at the beach, you are part of the problem. so don't start moaning about being in lockdown or preaching about how you don't have freedom anymore, you do, but there's a PANDEMIC!🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darrengrimes_ I'm all for Boris but I'm not gonna lie... we did see this coming &amp; we watched it coming with the front door wide open.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCNews everybody knows most conspiracies are BS &amp; just ignore them but when they're covered up/censored it only makes people believe them more, censoring them makes it look like there is something to hide lol. besides, reporting this as news only make him &amp; his conspiracies more popular<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KTHopkins @GovWhitmer i wonder why America is the worst-hit place in the world...   bunch of fool with guns acting like this minor sacrifice of a few weeks at home with their feet up is the end of the world &amp; the end of their freedom. when in fact staying at home will save the world &amp; their freedom🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews they need drastic pay cuts in general... never mind during a pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>wait until they watch white chicks... men dressing as women to show they are superior and the white face... well thats just too far... (FYI white chicks is one of the best movies ever and there is nothing offensive about it, same with tropic thunder, stop being so fragile minded)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews still going on about this? what a surprise. guess what, spamming the story wont change the result. sorry it ruins your narrative. probably time to realise we dont buy your BS no matter how hard you try to force it on us. unfortunately, you helped fuck the younger generations mind<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews anyone actually considered Kim IS dead and the satellites are just picking up images of the North Korean officials on a mad one getting pissed &amp; having boat parties at Kims luxury resorts to celebrate freedom?  below is leaked footage of an official off his head on kims meds🤣  https://t.co/UdoPRpwtpd<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RuneScape I think i started on the 3rd one but none are more iconic than the cinematic panning one that flew through all areas. seeing cools places I never saw before from quests &amp; high-level areas made me so excited to keep playing to get to them myself. it NEEDS to return 100%.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@odey_owojela the 3rd one is literally impossible.  I'm too fat to fold up like that and the closest I do get to it my knees don't even come close to my chin like that in the picture, haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@collector_vault I'd rather see lockdown overextended than ended too soon. is it really worth risking a second wave of the virus because some people can't handle the small sacrifice of chilling at home? the Spanish flu's 2nd wave was 3x as deadly than the first. better to be safe than sorry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KTHopkins da fuk? why so many against vaccination? that sounds as stupid as it does selfish to have a defence against a very serious virus. no one is going to inject you with nanobot microchips to control you or spy on you... as long as the vaccine is properly tested, what's the issue?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SWAM10056 @MailOnline why do we sit back and allow this bollocks... denying/banning a county being able to celebrate its culture in its own lands is in its self extremely offensive &amp; ridiculous. what gives a foreign culture the right to dictate what the host country can &amp; cant do with its own culture?  https://t.co/u1FL04kZDg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DVATW these little 10-second TikTok's are likely one of the very few moments of downtime &amp; stress relief they get atm. as for social distancing, they work hands-on with the infected. social distancing for NHS staff makes little sense giving they have to literally touch the infected.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews I mean... it's not exactly a bad thing🤷‍♂️ probably one of the few positives to come out of this pandemic.

This current situation is literally out of the hands of Boris, especially went people are still ignoring the lockdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PointlessBrexit @SkyNews I mean, its not exactly all his fault... At first he tried being PC about it to appease the left so they didn't scream dictator! by ASKING nicely for people to stay home But no one listened. so he had to TELL people to stay home... What happened? People went sunbathing in parks🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So can you lot just stay home now?...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Some irrelevant horrible ex-PM war criminal says something was ’PROBABLY slow’... Wtf is the purpose of reporting this as news???  I probably will go for a shit tomorrow... Put that in the news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Da fuk? I highly doubt that will happen. All well &amp; good remembering this ’event’ but shutting everything down for a week just to remember isn't very sensible, we still won't know the full effect of this current lockdown or when it will even end. Probably stick to a big statue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Can't they just press pause... If nothing goes in &amp; nothing comes out, they can't collapse. Just pause the game bruh.  https://t.co/poHWO6DXPf<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KTHopkins @MattHancock I disagree, I despised hancocks attidue in this interview. he tried to run the interview &amp; dodge questions, he made himself look &amp; sound stupid. He is a typical politician who thinks they are above answering to the people &amp; being held to account. Same old answer phone replies...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sophieloux__ 😍🤤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Thats one of the problems with Americans obsession with guns. They think more with their guns than their heads. How will guns help once you get corona? people sacrificed their lives in WW2... We are being asked to stay home &amp; watch Netflix🙄. Poor us having to struggle😑🤦‍♂️🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amnestyusa You need to realise, little to no one ever agrees with anything you try to preach or ’remind’ us about. 🤣  You are pissing in the wind with a mouthful of bullshit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimCognito2016 @RobBfromDerby @SkyNews Wait... You tweeted it 1 hour ago, they tweeted it 2 hours ago... Something doesn't add up 👀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews He abandoned his family, country &amp; duty so i’d say it's highly likely he will ’give up’ hunting... Harry enjoying that cuck life too much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulietB270880 all that is irrelevant... he lead labour to into a collapsing defeat in GE19, the worst for labour since 1939. that's nothing to be proud of. since the GE17 we had time to reflect &amp; realise just how devastating Corbyn would have actually been, we came to our senses :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarieAnnUK @davebending22 The Guardian. a bunch of over-exaggerating hysterical snowflake drama queens who find their own shadows racially offensive.😐  you preach about the graph yet the moment police crackdown on the idiots not isolating you'd be the first to cry that its oppressive &amp; controlling🤦‍♂️🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stronger_alone @MarieAnnUK its not Boris fault idiots dont listen&amp; rather get a tan than stay home. &amp; if you lot didnt prat about for 3 years deliberately ruining the UK out of spite because democracy didnt go your way, we would've left sooner &amp; got ourselves in order with a new, more secure border system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MsLFields @essenviews ughh😒, so Boris created the virus then? You need to research COVID-19's origin and look at other countries with the same, if not worse, situation then the UK is in, I imagine that is also the fault of Boris? sit back in self-isolation and have a think about how stupid you sound.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bobby19_ @ghoulgamer_ i get this is a meme but Christ, how can anyone make this pandemic, which no one was prepared for, into a party political issue... especially when the virus is so infectious it can, has &amp; will overwhelm even the most advanced health services in the world, its pretty pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews oh yikes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WellAged_ Bernie's heart almost gave out during this race, he literally had a heart attack. Ain't no way he can make it in another fail attempt in 2024 haha.

<|startoftext|>@rickygervais Oh dear, if the Happy tree friends theme tune is what plays in Ricky's head, I'm very concerned 🤣. Then again, maybe it's more concerning that I thought the show was brilliant and enjoyed it's dark &amp; sinister turns😆  https://t.co/pHkGk2KhwB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCWorld Is this is the point we must condemn the virus for racism or something?... Because we aren’t allowed to call on the said communities to make some changes because that would be branded racist in this day and age. 😆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CountDankulaTV I really can't decide who looks more like Wallace from Wallace &amp; Gromit, him or Ed Miliband... Ed certainly has Wallace's mouth 🤣  https://t.co/0Z52hPpf2w<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnBoyega Human trials NEED to happen somewhere sooner or later regardless of what race people are. Trying to cure/stop this virus goes way beyond petty skin colour bickering. The virus can infect everyone. If the tests where only done on whites no one would cry out for diversity then😆🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Mate! Wtf, spoilers!? Why the fuck ruin it... 😒<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CCbucko @PrisonPlanet he is clearly a new cop doing as he's told by his superiors so he doesn't get in trouble. whats more its embarrassing is that lot in the car are out unnecessarily during a lockdown in the first place... they are either ignorant or just stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet stupid people get asked stupid questions. those in the vehicle shouldn't be in their together in the first place, ignorant people like them is why the virus is able to spread like wildfire. we cant act as if the police are the only ones sounding/acting stupid in the situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Wow, so brave, so stunning so powerful, so inspiring. 🙄🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No way is Sky news taking an actress's advice on a real pandemic simply because she was in a film about one 10yrs ago🤦‍♂️🏻. celebs are giving tips they googled just for attention😒and Surely the films creator has better advice since they created it, not just read a script🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you are complaining about police doing their job &amp; saving lives in the process by telling dumb c*nts who don't listen to fuck off home because an infectious virus is going around killing people, then you need to sort your priorities out &amp; think about how stupid you sound.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SocialM85897394 That's the thing about celebrity &amp; politician socialists, they want to give away everybody elses money while they shamelessly hoard their own.  https://t.co/9h8TAr6Kh5<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SadiqKhan @unmeshdesai Yes, let’s get a “global response to a global virus”... the global virus which originated in CHINA, The one they covered up for 2 months... Hence the now ”global” part.🙄🤦‍♂️🏻 Lots of diseases are named after the place they originate. sorry but facts aren’t racism or hate.🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>half of this lot look like actual crack heads and the other half look like they are swelling up as if they've had an allergic reaction... 😆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews @SadiqKhan London Underground being open at all is ridiculous.  You might as well just cough the virus straight into everyones open mouths who are using the underground during this pandemic... 🗣🦠👄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews Here's an idea... Get rid of all alcohol in your home before you isolate. That way you won't be able to become an alcoholic because there will be no alcohol to guzzle on &amp; you won't be able to leave your home to get some if your self isolating... 🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews ok, get infected then🙄  *highly infectious deadly virus spreads around the world like wildfire*  BuT wHaT AbOuT tHe ThEaTeR pRoDuCtIoNs🤪 🤦‍♂️🏻 You moan Boris isnt doing or saying enough yet when he does you moan. think yourselves lucky its just ADVICE &amp; not mandatory...Yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missalicegrant If you know you are infected yet you still go around willy nilly knowing you can spread the virus doing so &amp; knowing it can kill people, especially older people... That is especially murder. It is illegal to deliberately spread HIV, it is also classed as murder, I believe. 🤷🏻‍♂️🦠🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews Yes, the US has them, they're perfect for London. You use an app to find a scooter &amp; pay to use it &amp; you can leave them anywhere &amp; the company(bird) finds them on GPS &amp; picks them up &amp; recharge them etc...Unfortunately, people like roadmen will steal or vandalise the scooters🤷🏻‍♂️😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Surely there is some way they can be ’frozen’ or whatever so they don't lose money etc...?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You do realise they banned us from travelling to the US last night, right? Literally no travel will be happening 🤣🤦‍♂️🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews The white boy &amp; his family were targetted and had to go into hiding for a year and move school because they were targeted but no one cared lol🤷🏻‍♂️. besides, Tommy will never get a fair hearing/trial no matter what because of who he is. the authorities wouldn't dare give him a win😆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HC_Richardson 10/10 for the troll👏🏼, very convincing, I almost thought this tweet was serious for a moment😄.... 😒.... 😐 ah.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews All talk, no action.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews ridiculous... it will never work. it will cause endless issues and problems on the already narrow roads of the UK... many people HAVE to park of pavements in residential areas to allow cars through &amp; so their cars don't get sideswiped.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Saying you dont need to be tested after hanging around someone who is confirmed to have the virus because you have no symptoms is the most irresponsible &amp; stupidest thing I have ever heard!

<|startoftext|>@darrengrimes_ If only the remainers didn't waste the past 3 years pointlessly delaying Brexit. We’d have left earlier and got our immigration sorted sooner so we could properly control people coming in spreading corona. Then again, seems like every British government is inherently incompetent.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RichardNorthey @britainelects @YouGov Sadly, Sadiq is unbeatable.

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Should have sung happy birthday when she washed her hands... 🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimMFelton He is speaking more common sense on the issue than almost all other politicians... even the PM, who is just telling us to sing happy birthday when washing our hands, meanwhile flights still arrive back from Italy &amp; other infected areas and we aren’t screening anyone. 😩🤦‍♂️🏻<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 the vicious &amp; relentless mob mentality of leftist makes it easy to no-platform people. But it shuts down debate. We must be free to debate, challenge &amp; hear ALL views. Trying to gag all opposition instead of engaging civilly makes leftists look weak &amp; afraid of being challenged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 We must all have the right to the same platforms so EVERYONES views can be debated &amp; challenged without fear of being deplatformed by leftist mobs who hate anyone with a different opinion. Its forcible suppression of opposition. Which is a key characteristic of, yes... fascism🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SadiqKhan @WOWisGlobal Everything’s a fucking hate crime according to you lot...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews The attack on pritti Patel has practically failed, just have to waste time &amp; millions on a meaningless inquiry to state the obvious fact it was all lies... so an attack on the Conservative party is the latest attempt to try and weaken our strongest Government in 40years 🤦🏻‍♂️😴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Get a grip, the pupils also make the same comments, if not worse. I guarantee that teacher was very popular with the pupils &amp; connected with them far better than the other teachers. Being strict &amp; shouty is far less effective than being a relatable teacher with banter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlazeBarnation Are you ignorant or just dumb? Look at the white woman before Boris girlfriend... she continued to clap as he got to her and she didn’t put her hand out to shake his hand... the two black guys did EXACTLY the same thing 🤦🏻‍♂️ no one was obligated to shake hands on either side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews it was never going to be cheap or easy to transition... especially after 3 years of remainers doing all they could to sabotage leaving, their actions cost us millions with the uncertainty they caused. In the scheme of things 4bill is nothing. short term cost for long term gain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Luton... enough said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews Why do people chat so much shit nowadays... they just don’t like that nothing is going their way anymore so out comes the hate card, offence card &amp; race card(Islam/Muslim isn’t a race FYI yet it’s still played). They are playing the same BS game as those gunning for pritti Patel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews If you look down while walking on the opposite side of the road to a Muslim you get called Islamophobic to some degree ffs. Guilty by association is a cheap BS election tactic. We all know London can only be won with the Muslim vote🙄 thats why Sadiq will win &amp; why #LondonIsOpen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So basically, if animal abusers kill animals fast enough they can get away with it🙂.  Maybe @rickygervais should give the RSPCA some advice on their next joke...😆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews well of course it is doesn't🤔. magic isn't a person so obviously, it won't have a gender, you prat. 🤦‍♂️ but its pretty damn clear the fairy god MOTHER has a gender... can you guess what one?... no silly, not male, its the other gender...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews That is just dumb...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews People need to start paying attention in biology class... No matter how much semen I dump up my bum, I will NEVER get pregnant, just as every other male wouldn't either.

<|startoftext|>@Ruptly Why are people seemingly only panic buying vegetables/ fruits &amp; various pastas 😆 the veg &amp; fruits will go bad in a week. You need long-lasting products like rice &amp; tinned food people! 👏🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews ...Nor were any other mayors invited. Sadiq is already on a massive power trip, him being in a cobra meeting is the last thing London needs. It's not coronavirus London has to be worried about, it's the #SadiqKhan virus that is destroying London as we speak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jdpoc lol, and how do you know the "actual story"?😆 I'm pretty sure no one knows exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hopenothate you'd think everyone would applaud a father for protecting his 8-year-old daughter from a pedo... then I read the comments of this hate groups tweet...😂🤦‍♂️the comments are full of lots of ignorant &amp; naive mindsets and lots of hate for #TheSun newspaper as well as hate in general.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Diamond__Lights @hopenothate @MOxlonge calm down, its just a newspaper 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlademarkSUFC @hopenothate he wasn't exactly going to shake the hand of the pedo who just groped his 8-year-old daughter was he?...🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samcro1882 @hopenothate @Daisybelll lmao. grow up, its a newspaper, ffs.🤣 its spouts just as much shit as all the other newspaper😂.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NinaNchaudhry97 @hopenothate i assume you think the same of his 8-year-old daughter...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlanChr45778212 @hopenothate Like how the pedo 'couldn't help himself' when he groped Tommy's 8-year-old daughter in the pool, huh?  the pedo is not a danger to society or little girls at all...🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyoCaesar a pedo groping your 8-year-old daughter is probably a very good cause for a 'fight'... 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Police just continue to prove Tommy's point every time lol, it's embarrassing.   And if they think they can silence Tommy again when this time it's his own daughter who is the victim, I think they have another thing coming, he will not let this drop if the pedo gets away with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews The guy molested Tommy’s 8 year old daughter in a swimming pool in front of him... are you really going to be that blatant and leave that very key detail out? That just show all people need to know about the media, they’d rather protect pedos than expose them. 🤦‍♂️🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews how pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Honestly, no one cares... Like we really REALLY don't care. it was an act and any normal person understands that &amp; didn't gave a shit what was on their bandanas, it was irrelevant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews They better hurry up and gain independence then so they are immune.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews What about the duty to provide men a ’safe space’ too?.... It goes both ways. Gender-neutral toilet are a stupid idea.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews @Stone_SkyNews so they stay at the Turk/Syria border for 2 years instead of trying to head into Turkish cities to get a job. but the moment they know the Europe border is open they rush there because, like the guy said, free health care etc...🙄 last migrant crisis crippled many EU countries.😑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@raggapegs it was because China has had to close factories because of the virus which has started to cause a knock-on effect, it had nothing to do with trump🤣. stock markets are dipping all around the world right now because of something out of the hands of any one world leader.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBCNews no 3rd runway will soon cause the UK &amp; London to drastically fall behind from the rest of the world... its Europe's busiest airport, we NEED that third runway. better yet, lets invest in and build the 'BORIS ISLAND' airport it will be very beneficial, especially in the long term.  https://t.co/arIDgyADTF<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tonyforindy more than half the stuff in your house was made in china... 🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Stating facts isn't racism.🤦‍♂️ This obsession with branding everything racist is getting very old, very fast. The term racist is so overused &amp; wrongly used that it will end up carrying no weight &amp; little meaning and more &amp; more people will just shrug off being called racist🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews Thing is, that first part is true no matter how much you try to argue against it 🤣 the second part though... Can't say I agree...🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCBreaking We ain't interested, we are focusing on how racist white people are for the next few days 😐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews The polluting part of airports is the planes... Not the terminals 😆 You can never be carbon zero because of humans, as well as every, leaving breathing thing releasing Co2 as they exhale 😆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah but it's literally not racist though is it...  You just want it to be racist so you have your daily fix of branding someone or something racist. If you think it's racist then you are racist because you see &amp; judge everything by race &amp; colour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews just because vegans shout extremely loud about being vegan it does not mean it is a popular or modern lifestyle choice... vegans are a vocal minority, stop changing everything to suit a mouthy few that spites the many.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carljokl huh?... where exactly has the NHS gone🤔it is still there &amp; will continue to be there.  and the majority of people, whether they are on the left or right, do not wish to pay the BBC licence fee. and if you think with no licence fee there will be no BBC, you are an absolute fool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarolineVoaden @patel4witham Immigrants aren't slaves🤦‍♂️🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews Jeremy, you’re irrelevant.  The flooded areas are dangerous so why would boris go there? It gives authorities more things to worry about just for the PM to have a few photos, he cant do anything useful there but shake hands with people that are going to be really pissed off. Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Well she is right... we’ve become lazy... we sit back with our feet up while immigrants flood in and do the low end jobs for a much lower wage. we have more than enough people do those jobs but they feel they are above the work because we’ve exploited immigrant workers too long😒<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetalFox8 @GrossieGore @RSPCA_official well he is always OTT about everything but i think he is just happy at the fact the 'trolls' failed in trying to get his dogs taken away after the RSPCA came to check on the dogs and were satisfied there was no animal abuse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews @BorisJohnson Well, Boris isn't a ”real racist”... Whatever that's supposed to mean?... Also, Windrush wasn't due to racism, it was an administrative error.🤦‍♂️🏻 as for reparations... Who exactly are we paying? No slaves or slavers are alive today &amp; Britain ended slavery over 180 years ago<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please, Just fuck off... Shits going far too far😩. Jokes are not harassment. to try claim they're is bloody pathetic &amp; ridiculous. It's just another way to forcefully shut down criticism... I believe it's called fascism, no matter how you try to sugar coat it &amp; play the victim🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews @charli_xcx Don't start preaching &amp; complaining about so called inequality in front of the cameras while in the same breath saying ”we (woman) are the main event”. That doesn't solve inequality that flips it. not that it matters because we vote on talent NOT gender anyway🤦‍♂️🏻#Brits2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>bisexual female tomboy/hipster makes her life unnecessarily difficult for herself and blames everyone else &amp; moans about trivial things like being unable to decide on a haircut (i have that problem🙃) yet blames the hairdresser for making a "fuss"🤔. #GoBald no more haircuts...🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews its not reported because it is literally a non-issue.  they cant know who on the train they're sending to &amp; you cant know who sent it. who the hell keeps their Bluetooth or airdrop etc on anyway, thats a yikes. if you do receive a photo, just instantly delete it and move on.🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews 'appear to be falling'... that's coming from a communist country where their top priority is to not be humiliated or be seen as an embarrassment. not to mention they are arresting every person leaking real first-hand footage of the reality of what is actually happening...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BernieSanders 11 million undocumented people in your country!? Wtf, that should scare you... Yet you want to play them as the victims and reward them for sneaking into your country illegally... Nice dude.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews this weasel acting like he runs this country... how about you go clean the blood-stained streets of London!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews so what?... we are voting for the music, not the gender.  get that into your thick heads.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>it is not an 'absolute disgrace' at all... why should they be nominated by gender for something that has NOTHING to do with gender... miss me with this absolute bollocks, please...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Okay... You save that minuscule number of trees &amp; hult the production of hundreds of electric cars... Hope it makes you feel better🤣. those electric cars will help cut down pollution 10x what those few surrounding trees would. 🤣🤦‍♂️🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews Yeah well, she can re-submerge &amp; disappear with the other remnants of her beloved caliphate. Which by the way, she would still be happily living in as she pumps out babies to create ISIS soldiers. She didn't give British citizenship a second glance until her Paradise fell part.🚫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SadiqKhan No sensible level headed person would ever vote for you. Look how you've ran London into the gutter &amp; stain the streets with blood. You are dangerous. Its a shame you have imported your voter base that will vote for you simply because you have the same religion &amp; skin colour. 😐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent Those in the comments with pitchforks ready to lynch Freeman need to learn the difference between beating a child &amp; smacking a child. One is abuse, the other discipline. The lack of child discipline nowadays is a major factor as to why more &amp; more kids are stabbing each other🙄😐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i love #cybermen this one was awesome. finally some good acting. shame the serious tone &amp; evil demeanour of the cyberman was completely undermined by Dora the 13th explorer &amp; the clueless 'fam'. you know the shows in a bad place when you think it would be better with no doctor...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcusjdl We've had many worse governments... This one is far from the worst.🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews As if the majority of people will listen... Can you imagine the PC uproar from the left screaming nazi if we forced isolated like China? Can you really see the roadmen self-isolating? 🤣Same with those who cant afford to take a day off work &amp; those who think it's all fake...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon The homeless would have a chance if you didn't flood London with your voter base.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoveIsland @chloeweekender_ i mean... she didnt help herself but her presenting #LoveIsland was probably the only thing that kept her from hitting rock bottom and kept her going during all that stuff she had going on but you snatched it out from under her and kicked her to the curb🤷‍♂️🙃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FreddieBailey96 #Megan &amp; #Caroline are complete opposites. you can not compare someone who is a literal princess who will never want for anything to someone who hit rock bottom in both career and private life. #CarolineFlackRIP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews just run ads... the revenue is insane. also, reduce the wage of overpaid presenters &amp; fire the shit ones. a few just got a pay rise. they already get well over £11m a show. also, you'd save a fortune &amp; become 100% more efficient if you wasnt overstaffed with diversity employees.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmyMek He was likely born &amp;raised here. yet look at his attitude/mentality towards us. he was clearly raised here on foreign values &amp; mentality. He was born in this land but raised to despise the natives &amp; their culture. He has the typical Islam ’us vs them’ mentality &amp; so will his kids<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SadiqKhan So much for ”London is open”...🤦‍♂️🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SadiqKhan @stephenctimms @rokhsanafiaz @unmeshdesai @newhamlabour @LondonLabour This is the diversity Sadiq khan speaks so highly of.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK When you say “Muslim pride” is it pride of being Muslim or pride of being a gay Muslim?😂(pretty sure the 2nd is a big no no in Islam).

<|startoftext|>@BilldeBlasio @OwenJones84 @BernieSanders That’s if the fella doesn’t have another heart attack during the campaign trail 🤪🤣🤦🏻‍♂️ he is literally unfit for office 😂😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UN @UNPeacekeeping Gender advisers? Wtf? gender is literally of no concern to the people of DRC... they have actual real issues to worry about. they’re not questioning if they are male, female or making their own genders because they aren’t influenced or indoctrinated by western media or PC SJWs 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCSport @BBCWorld It’s a fucking haircut.... like hello?... why is this news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews Just call it ‘the ram cunt manoeuvre’ because that’s what those who do moped crime are 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Literally everyone in the comments agree with him lol, I'm surprised considering how mouthy, vicious &amp; opinionated the LGBT(ect...) &amp; ’woke’ snowflakes are on Twitter. They are staying well away from criticising or ’cancelling’ Putin🤔🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JagexRyan Oof, that will take a BITE out of your cash stack for sure 💰💰💰😄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews are you stupid?...  They were training new staff, look it up, they literally tweeted about it on their official twitter.🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I am 100% for the restoration of #BigBen /Elizabeth tower but fuck me, can we please get come competency in the establishment when it comes to budget &amp; financial management for once?... It's honestly embarrassing &amp; should not be this level of incompetence in government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GerardBattenUK @TheMistressRox She emanates hatred for the English. she strives to rip the UK apart for her own gain by creating division &amp;a vicious bitter attitude in Scotland towards England/UK with her talk of braveheartesque independence. When in fact there is no independence if it rejoins the EU.🤦‍♂️🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Don't start getting cocky... 🤣🏸  https://t.co/ha9BDvcjnp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCWorld Majority of us don't know who she is so this news just comes off as subtle begging for donations for another piano for some random woman. Also news outlets need to get the price right, is it a 150k or 200k piano? Make your minds up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What stigma? It literally came from China &amp; majority who are infected/died are chinese. Facts arent stigma🤦‍♂️🏻. I guess, technically the virus is racist &amp; hates diversity &amp; equality... I imagine its also nonbinary🤣. COVID-19? Lol everyone will continue to call it corona😆🦠<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 Damage depends on how many more kids will be fed hormone blockers &amp; pushed into irreversible surgery by 13 because irresponsible adults decide their kids are trans because a boy picks up a doll or a girl an action figure, it's pure child abuse, no wonder most are suicidal by 20.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Fuck EVER going on a cruise. 😂 And to think I actually looked into working on cruise ships... 😷  https://t.co/eP6pLMCzmk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, the diversity of this advert is incredibly... Diverse🤦‍♂️🏻.  The advert would make sense if @SadiqKhan didn't outright ban the adverts with white models in bikinis on them... The hypocrisy is sickening &amp; ironically racist in nature 🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BBCWorld Trolls like the Chinese doctor who originally warned about how serious the virus is?...  How'd that go for him again?... arrested by police for warming of the danger &amp; forced to say he way lying and then ended up dying because of the very thing he tried to warning people about.🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Evan_257 BBC hasnt made anything resembling doctor who for, at least, the past 5 years. It's just an actual pile of dog shit with a little flag with the word tardis written on it. Their SJW PC stance on the show is talking the show. They should just sell the rights to doctor who Netflix🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon All British are European too, you fool.🤡 Maybe now 180,000 London born brits can finally return to their capital city where they were born which you pushed them out of to import your voter base to secure your position... That's the only reason you preach about #LondonIsOpen 😴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews No thanks, couldn't think of anything more aids than to listen to a bunch of vile people who will be terrible for the whole UK. Labour voters must be ashamed at their leader choice🤣. but labour have to pay for their actions the past 3 years. &amp;the stain of Corbyn will linger too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCPolitics No strikes for weeks? Literally just last week french firefighters set themselves on fire in protest then had full-on fights with the police after the police full on charged and attacked them &amp; innocent unarmed people &amp; beat them down in the streets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissDomergue News outlets need to learn what trolls are🤔. The woman is practically a troll herself by purposely setting up &amp; posing for a photo of her breastfeeding her 3-year-old on a shop floor with scattered items all over the floor to dramatise it &amp; get a reaction for being so strange🤨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Engerlandm8 @SkyNews I know right. It decided to start in China and those it has infected &amp; killed are 99% Chinese people... Where is the diversity &amp; equality in those it has infected &amp; killed!? It's disgusting behaviour... The virus was born of pure racism! 🙃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews People take precaution around others to prevent spread of a serious virus, how racist... It's almost as if it originated in China &amp; spread around the world🤦‍♂️🏻. Also people who don't understand memes &amp; comic relief of serious things interpret it as racism &amp; cause hysteria.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews this smug weasel cries about having no money to fund police &amp; fight crime yet he seems to have so much cash laying around that he can just tip a drag queen £1000 as if it's nothing 🙄🤨🤦‍♂️🏻😑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Queer is a term used to insult gay men. Or is she using it's another meaning of strange/odd?... Rather fitting.😆  She's reduced herself to nothing more than a letter in a group which preaches unique individuality but packs peoples identity into letters &amp; in most case just a + 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ashoswai It most likely actually says 'Valhalla'.🤦‍♂️ But whoever was studying the partial artefacts were either incompetent or they went full OTT PC and deliberately misinterpreted it because they want to be seen as PC rather than genuinely document &amp; study historical facts accurately.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC @ianpaynesport if you dont know who they are, of course, you will mistake them... countless people have mistakable features🤦‍♂️. people barely respect ANY kind of politician, becasue of their behaviour over the past 3 years. respect is earned! i guarantee most brits dont even know who she is...😂  https://t.co/2Fe3tKUC6d<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews You're saying the same thing which Tommy Robinson has been saying &amp;warning about for years &amp; witnessed firsthand. but you ignored, slandered&amp; censored him but now the problem is becoming too big &amp;blatant to be ignored &amp; covered up. Its embarrassing, Tommy was right all along🤔🙃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews Sadiq khans LBC interviews are utter bollocks, every word he speaks is insincere meaningless crap &amp; deflections with that weaselly smug look on his face. he only does interviews with his buddy arrogant O'Brien because he handholds him throughout it while they play footsie...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>GENDER DOES NOT MAKE A GOOD DIRECTOR! it's imagination, vision, creativity, skill &amp; experience which makes a good director. its also very important to understand what fans want &amp; expect when it comes to film franchises (something Ryan johnson failed to understand with Star Wars).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tesla4the @DanielRoche95 @SkyNews why should a director get first pick simply because they are a female? gender does not make you a good director.  it's imagination, vision, creativity, as well as skill &amp; experience, which makes a good director.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews No.  It is against my beliefs to not eat meat. It's incredibly offensive to be told what I can &amp; can't eat &amp; have my beliefs trampled over &amp; disregarded because some small group of stuck up people want to dictate &amp; act all high &amp; mighty &amp; righteous &amp; be patronizing towards me.😐<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC @MatthewStadlen As long as the tough challenge &amp; quality of the tests weren't brought down to a lower level just so women are able to pass the tests to fill yet another gender quota. If you want equality then the woman must be able to pass the current gruelling tests men have to endure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Careful, the left will call the isolation racism😂 People in the west can't even wear face masks now without being accused of racism by the wrong’uns of the left🤦‍♂️🏻😆.

<|startoftext|>@LBCNews UGHH... EVERYTHING IS RACIST &amp; EVERY WHITE PERSON IS BORN RACIST, WE GET IT😴.

<|startoftext|>@Forest2Furnitur brits have every right to wave their flag🤔😂 it's the Vice President who lacked manners. It's attitudes like hers which is a reason we left🤣...

<|startoftext|>@WiteWulf They're(were) the biggest single party in the EU parliament. They won the EU elections. Guess who put them there...

<|startoftext|>Is the coronavirus racist for only originating in China??😱 the infected are 98% Asian &amp; deaths are 100% Asian, That is pure racism to the extreme, IMO.

<|startoftext|>@Leonorcita2 @ObsessedCity @BBCWorld 1. They are there by choice.  2. They make a lot of money. 3. Many strippers actually feel empowered in many ways in their position.  4. You will find it's the men visiting the clubs that are exploited 😂... Trust me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Blayofficial You realise a deadly contagious airborne virus is going around, right? People, no matter their colour/race, will be taking extra precautions... it's nothing to do with racism🤦‍♂️🏻, it's about prevention &amp; precaution. Is the virus racist because it started in China??... 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews that's sweet and all but they have crime to stop... not big macs to deliver.  there are other delivery drivers who could do the delivery instead.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Crypto_Bitlord @bkkxrp I think the situation is bigger than just you😆.

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews @BBC Drop the wokeness and your programs will finally be watchable.

<|startoftext|>@LeeChronicle @SkyNews Lol, you can't really compare the entire death toll of well over 150 years worth of ladder-related deaths to the death toll of under a month worth of virus-related deaths... Most of these 80 deaths happened within the past week and each day the death &amp; infected almost double 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Why does everyone have to change &amp; adapt for them? why cant they adapt &amp; change for ballet?... literally no point in them doing ballet if ballet has to be changed to suit them, it’s ridiculous. Campaigners need to stop trying to force change unnecessarily &amp; when it's not needed🤨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @MatthewStadlen Depends on their attitude towards me... If someone's going to be a sad petty c*nt towards me for voting differently then they can jog on. why would I befriend someone with different interests &amp; stuff to me anyway? I'm not obligated to be anyone’s friend just because they ’exist’.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>lol... I support abortion but fuck off is it health care, Wtf?😂 it certainly should not be promoted or used as a contraceptive either, if you're ignorant, irresponsible &amp; stupid enough to get pregnant 3 times a month &amp; abuse the abortion system, you probably need sterilizing 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Our Co2 emissions are less of a concern than places like India &amp; China... They're two of the biggest polluters on earth and go largely unchecked &amp; almost unhounded by activists, especially from within the actual respective countries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidLammy If we didn’t leave we would end up not being on the world stage at all because we wouldn't exist anymore. We’d be absorbed into a United States of Europe with absolutely no autonomy while we are sucked dry &amp; become the next Greece 😆<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBCNews But it's not far-right attack though is it. You're phrasing it that way to cause more division &amp; to gain more clicks. It was just an attack and even then it's not even an actual attack it was more harassment &amp; damage to property if anything. Not everything is left v right...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Have to admit though, they are nice🙇‍♂️🏻🤷🏻‍♂️ Anyone branding the ad sexist is a prude &amp; needs to get a life &amp; stop making issues out of NOTHING.

<|startoftext|>@shahmiruk @ShadwellJones @MNEK @LozzaFox You label the ’alt-right’ as racist when in fact it's your side of the arguments that sees EVERYTHING through colour(&amp;gender).

<|startoftext|>@LBCNews Only if they have already been here for X amount of years paying tax etc and not just handed out to the entirety of the EU.

<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon @CrimestoppersUK TLDR:  it's part &amp; parcel of living in a big city. It's a far-right terror attack. It was a racially motivated attack.

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews mmmm... no... a woman can be just as incompetent as a leader as a man can.  demanding a leader based on gender is stupid box-ticking. we've had 2 female PM's one was one of our strongest PM's, the other the weakest. your gender does NOT determine your effectiveness as a leader...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So what?... this obsession with diversity is pathetic &amp; rediculous... they are meant to be nominated for their work, not their gender or skin colour.

<|startoftext|>@EveningStandard huh?... kemp was 'reluctant' to talk to a guy who talks about the largely ignored rape gangs. makes no sense. he is more than willing to talk to rapists &amp; murderers &amp; travel the world to talk to violent gangs &amp; terrorist groups etc he even got held at gunpoint &amp; shrugged it off🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aidoo_andrea @KhanUR1983 He was treated mostly as a normal inmate &amp;was only in the solitary block for his high profile &amp; safety (like Assange), the prison didnt want his murder on their watch. why is bringing attention to rape gangs hate🤔? its not his fault they're primarily of a particular background🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC @ShelaghFogarty Sorry, but wasnt she found guilty of lying about it all with video evidence proving no rape? Why is she suddenly the victim?... 🤔Lying about rape is so easy nowadays in our PC society, people instantly believe the accuser &amp; crucify the accused before even being found guilty...🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>....wha....what?...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews Trump did it 🙃  🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent It cheapens itself... films were winning awards before even being released in cinemas... How?  Celebrity political statements are nothing more than selfish opportunist virtue signaling &amp; half of them dont have a clue what they’re preaching about😂 we need more like @rickygervais<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews How? It’s only been a thing the past 3yrs since this PC SJW crap kicked off. on the whole barely anyone uses made-up pronoun &amp; wasn't even invented until the end of the decade😂 it's the most self-dehumanising &amp; alienating BS ever seen. No wonder mental health is bad nowadays...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Vegan are vegans because they hate meat products yet they demand vegan foods which are as similar to meat products (i.e. Sausage rolls, burgers &amp; steak bakes etc...)

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews You cut out the bit just before when no one was crying out loud or at all until the supreme leader of the first order started to 'cry' after he stopped talking, then suddenly everyone feels the urge to burst out sobbing all at the exact same time.😂 at least make it convincing...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews 1. That's what happens when you get uncontrollably drunk. 2. He probably needed a tactical wank in the toilets to get some post nut clarity to come to his senses and realise the strippers aren't in love with him nor do they want to shag him... 😂 it's his own fault.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews What a lad.  Good thing he did stay home to fire fires because @rickygervais roasted everyone at the #GoldenGlobes 🔥🔥😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As if the poor hard done by celebs sipping their champagne &amp; enjoying slap up meals &amp; wearing priceless jewels spared a genuine thought for any of that🤣. @rickygervais hosting the #GoldenGlobes is everything we need &amp; everything he said was true hence why it hurt &amp; I love it!😈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KTHopkins Funny thing is most of them are here because they either fled Iran because actions of people like him or they’re first-gen immigrants born here but raised on a purely Iranian mentality with little integration into British society because its all their immigrant parents know.😔🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews He NEEDED to go to the toilets and bust a nut to get some urgent post-nut clarity.😲 Everyone knows a man is at his most vulnerable when horny &amp; being cock teased all night non-stop. A man can be so easily manipulated in that state. It may sound like a joke but it's so true.😅😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nadjdaniela @OwenJones84 Iran attacked a US embassy the day before... Last I checked embassies are classed as foreign soil... So they attacked American territory. They started it now are crying because they got a smack for misbehaving 😂. But how killing a top general isn't automatic war is beyond me😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews It would be to little benefit... It will just be Corbyn etc crying &amp; moaning that one of his peaceful loving friends are being targeted🤣, nothing constructive will be said or done. Even though they started it in the first place😂🤦‍♂️🏻 isn't parliament back Tuesday anyway?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DickDelingpole The term Bisexual wasn't created by PC SJWs so it is seen as illegitimate so they created a woke option with the same meaning. just like being straight has been unofficially rebranded by SJWs as Cis-man/woman.😆 pansexual is just a badge to point out your bisexuality is woke 🙄🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews I used to always watch most haunted as a kid! I loved it even though I was too scared to move off the sofa after.

<|startoftext|>@CNNPolitics What a lad😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shrek8777 @SkyNews It literally just means Bisexual😂.  its just a fancy term PC SJWs wear as a badge to points out to other PC SJWs for approval that they will shag anyone including the ones that identify as things like lizards or cats and other random weird things etc...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Kids in 2020 after watching Eternals will be thinking they will get superpowers if they become transgender...😬😂.(depending how hard it's forced &amp; pointed out)  us kids after watching spiderman in 2002 thought we could climb walls but we just ended up with broken bones😂...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Samfr "will be white middle aged men again" what relevance does that have at all??? Having females or coloured leaders means nothing other than ticking boxes... Just because they'd be coloured or female doesnt mean they are automatically capable as a leader, May is a testament to that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon @BlackGirlFest Hilarious hypocrisy. So much for equality &amp; glorious multiculturalism the left preach about. People keep saying "can't be racist to whites". Yet to deprive young students of funding &amp; placements for being white is literal racism😂🤔🤦🏻‍♂️racism goes all ways no matter colour or race.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC MEAT FREE steak bakes are literally NOT steak bakes!🤦🏻‍♂️ create a completely new name if you want to eat gunk.

<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan The fact he is polish/Eastern European is irrelevant... you know that.

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews I'm surprised she can even write. She hasnt been to school since nursery 😆😂🤣 Who am I kidding, she didnt even write any of those speeches.

<|startoftext|>@Rich60gell @SkyNews Look at the suspects AND victims of knife crime then have a think about why they are the majority being searched... Its not racist, its reality. I'm sure being stopped &amp; searched is preferable to being stabbed, am I wrong? If you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tmalbrghtn @jonathanmilne25 @SkyNews Maybe thats because they’re the majority of suspects AND victims of knife crime?🤦🏻‍♂️ surely its better to be searched for 3 minutes than stabbed to death? S&amp;S isn't an issue if you have nothing to hide. We get stopped &amp; searched in airports for safety, same principle for S&amp;S🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews But they literally are the main culprits to be carrying knives etc... It's not racist if they are the majority suspects. I'm sorry but it's true, just look at the victims &amp; suspects of knife crime... It's very clear. Stop &amp; search isn't an issue if you have nothing to hide... 🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gletherby @jeremycorbyn judging by 80+% of the things Corbyn is promising will be free, the money to pay for all that free stuff will need to come from somewhere. taking all our money won't be enough to cover the cost of their fantasy 'everything free world' so the borrowing will be unimaginable!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews this looks like some cult witch hunt, calm down.

<|startoftext|>i cant believe the stupidity of this argument...

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews we only use fireworks a couple times a year... just because of one alleged incident doesn't mean we suddenly need to restrict or ban fireworks.  more people die in cars than pets from fireworks... cars arent banned. more people also choke to death on food, must we ban food too?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Did you hear about the free stuff commie said he will give everyone?  Definitely, not a stunt to scrounge ignorant student votes😂🤦🏻‍♂️.

<|startoftext|>@LBCNews Boris will ruin himself... why the f*ck would you refuse this? having like-minded opposition in parliament is so much easier to work with&amp; pass things🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ I guess Boris wants to keep an uncooperative &amp; frustrating opposition. it's selfish to not put country before party! 😠🤦‍♂️😠<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews why must they?... because they know they cant fight trump in an election fair &amp; square?... how can anyone be happy with people like those wanting to impeach trump just for him existing, being in government? such weakness has no place in government.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 But i dont believe that you don't believe. See how weak of an argument that is?...

<|startoftext|>@LBCNews Boris wasn't the one who forced the Benn surrender act through... The remain Parliament did.

<|startoftext|>@LBCNews Give it a rest ffs, what is the problem🙄?? Please tell me? It was very clear he wasnt taking the piss out of the army medic in any way.

<|startoftext|>@Kevin_Maguire He didn't waste it, The remain Parliament did.  they had no intention of leaving on the 31st &amp; at the last second forced him, by law, to beg like a dog to the EU.

<|startoftext|>@paulsperry_ Shown respect like those who brought the twin towers down did? or like those who carried out the 7/7 bombings? Or how about Manchester arena?

<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 a G.E. IS a people's vote. Its a proper peoples vote where the we can finally hold to account &amp; fire our employees(the MPs)! They can only lock themselves in parliament for so long. A 2nd ref (with R v R options) is a ploy for the remain parliament to selfishly keep their seats🤡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewStadlen @LBC only ones calling for a 2nd ref are remainers.  parliament is 70% remain &amp; a 2nd ref is just a selfish ploy for remain MPs to protect their seats, they're scared of a GE. a 2nd ref will be controlled by the remain parliament &amp; be remain V a remain parliament sabotaged Brexit...😠  https://t.co/ENy27xnxmK<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@snb19692 Anyone can buy spambots... It's really no hard. remainers would be that sad &amp; desperate to go that far though🤣   it’s such a blatant spam message... almost as if someone wanted it to be seen.🤔 If someone was spambotting their own page they'd be a lot more subtle about it...🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nick_Pye @Janice4Brexit @MarianneSansum Should also ask those immigrants who travelled through all the other safe European nations(some 3x the size of UK) to then risk their lives to try to cross the channel illegally. If they can make it to north France safely, there is no need to them to keep going unless for crime🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarianneSansum We didn't bloody know they were there🤔. Maybe if China got rid of communism, treated its people better, left hong kong alone &amp; fixed its horrendous pollution then its people wouldnt feel the need to have to chill in a freezer for hours to illegally enter our country to be safe🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 A GE will be the people deciding!🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️  Anyone calling for a 2nd ref (only remainers) are doing so to protect their party from the people(majority leave) &amp; the remain MPs want to selfishly protect their seats. A ref2 question will be remain v unacceptable remain sabotaged brexit.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GMB Since when do people ever respect the elderly in 2019... She must have assumed they voted for brext &amp;was surprised they was sat there alive.

<|startoftext|>@addicted2newz @JohnMannMP “We must put it to the people”  “I’m not scared to lose my job”  Yes, this is the same woman who refuses to put it to her constituents to have their say in a by-election on who represents them after she abandon the Conservative party. 🤦🏻‍♂️ She is a scared #Disgraceful hypocrite😑<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@alanjstedman @NearlyThere19 yes, I see it... the old EU flag does have a slight similarity in design to its new one with the centralised circle but for obvious reasons, they had to rebrand but their goal still remains... to gain total control of the European continent and consolidate it into an empire.🤣🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StuartJ77 @OxfordDiplomat they're also remainers who want to outright stop Brexit &amp; they ignore our voice, refused us a GE twice &amp; refuse to hold by-elections. then they stand there scratching their heads as to why people are so angry. so they just push the blame onto Boris for saying "surrender" HA!🤦‍♂️😂  https://t.co/GX1IU7wWXU<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MrBrendanCox The left/remain use her name/memory as a moral stick to beat leavers with, it is sick!

<|startoftext|>Wait! * rubs eyes * is this an actual MP actually speaking sense for once! Wow, a rare occurrence. got £20 for you if you stand up to tell them all to f*ck off &amp; grow up 😆👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Such HUMBUG! The bill is a surrender!  If traitor, betrayal, humbug &amp; surrender are inciting dangerous words, What about the vile inflammatory language of the left! Racists, unintelligent, nazi, xenophobic, bigots, fascist and expression of great glee of elderly leavers dying!🤦🏻‍♂️  https://t.co/TRP74LTcPV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews yes, honour her by getting Brexit done so the remainers cant use her death as a stick to beat leavers with anymore... its sick to use a dead person as a weapon in that way...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 rhetoric? what, humbug? surrender?🤨I think MPs who stick two fingers up to 17.4m people by deliberately dragging out uncertainty &amp; frustrating Brexit to stop it are to blame. people are getting angry because they know they are being deliberately ignored by a remain parliament.  https://t.co/0TPtHMUJVH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn What the f*ck are you on about??? What's shocking? Humbug?... Get a back bone will you. And stop using Jo Cox’s murder as a weapon...

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Well derrrrrrr!  Men can not give birth... Stop this notmalisation &amp; encouragement of confused mental states &amp; poor mental health issues... You think it's trendy but it's mental abuse of vulnerable people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews She admitted she had to LITERALLY stop being a man by stopping her hormone replacement medication to allow her natural bodily functions to start up again so she could start ovulating. That is not possible as a biological male!... FACT!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNewsBreak For billions of years there has only ever been 2 genders in every species to ever exist (including dinosaurs)... How is it humans magically evolved in the space of 8-10 years to have infinite genders &amp;pregnant males?. Its just not possible to evolve so drastically in a few years.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ShelaghFogarty No he didn't, 11 judges decided he did, just because the prorogation was a few days longer than normal. They essentially called the Queen naive &amp; stupid but we’re too weak to even comment on it. They had no evidence, they literally had to just assume the PMs political motives 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oliviamccue000 @TessaRedig @SkyNews or our MPs, government &amp; parliament could stop being such weak cucks &amp; get a backbone &amp; stand up for the UK &amp; its interests for once &amp; show some strong leadership &amp; stop spreading this depressing defeatist attitude across the nation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@83dkinnersley @SkyNews  https://t.co/nyHMDGG5LW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews not if remainer EU cucks have anything to say about it im afraid...  they'd rather be shackled and forced to take deals imposed on us that could hurt us rather than make our own deals to benefit us and make us prosper &amp; grow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanDunt huh?he addressed it before his speech. he is there representing us at the UN assembly. he has to be professional, what did you want him to do? break down in tears over a UK domestic issue while giving an unrelated speech? makes no sense. if I was him I'd be openly fuming about it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidLammy You refused a general election 2 times... Sit down, your embarrassing yourself 🤦🏻‍♂️.  You're happy to let the people vote (in a remain only option 2nd ref) just as long as your seat is safe from a general election... YOU’RE WEAK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 Just how remainers are at war with it too, huh? 3 years you lot have spat in the face of democracy &amp; 17.4m. We are only in this mess of a dead lock because of remainers relentless desperation &amp;refusal to accept a lost democratic vote. Seems democracy only suits you when you win🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scott_emilyrose Oh ok, just leave 150k British citizens stranded in foreign countries then🤷🏻‍♂️. To completely bailout thomus cook would have cost over £1bill but it would be a waste because the fatcat directors would continue to mismanage &amp; rinse it back into bankruptcy to line their pockets more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Yes, it is a fantastic day... for remainers!. Fantastic day for Democracy? Certainly not.   it's just another day at which desperate remainers have spat in the face of democracy &amp; the people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Taking back control!? HA!  ITS MPs LIKE HER THAT HAVE GOT US HERE IN THE COMPLETE DEADLOCK AND SHE IS HARDLY ONE TO TALK ABOUT GIVING BACK CONTROL WHEN SHE CLINGS TO HER SEAT &amp; REFUSES A BY ELECTION &amp; A GENERAL ELECTION.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scott_emilyrose Thomas cook was in over £1 billion of debt. the bailout needed was over £200m with another £900m on top of that but they only asked the government for £150m bailout so government refused because it wouldnt help, it would just be a waste of taxpayers money, like pissing on a fire.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews how many people die or become seriously ill from regular smoking every year?... smoking hasn't been banned, so people cant be concerned that much when regular smoking is so unsafe itself. the only ones actually moaning about vaping are nonsmokers and the cigarette companies.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews @freddymcconnell In the interview they Literally state they had to STOP BEING A MAN &amp; wait for their natural bodily functions to continue so they could bare a child.  🤔 I guarantee if I insert some semen into any part of my body I will not get pregnant no matter what... why is that??☹️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This world... I just can’t anymore. This obsession with gender is mad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn But you are afraid that’s the thing... So scared that you don’t even trust the public to have a general election, you coward. how much longer until your deputy leader stabs you in the back and takes over the party anyway? We all know it’s coming😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact is is even being discussed is fucking ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BFranklin2017 @neiltyson But one person did cause all those things... He is called God. How's that saying go again?... ”All is as God wills it”, right? We probably cant question a god, we might get smited🤔🙃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ninja You mean you logged into dog *cough*mixer*cough* shit😂  https://t.co/x6oueKFpUP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews America is majority white🤦🏻‍♂️. why is it only the dweeby white guy shooters who get reported on? There's been Hispanic &amp; black shooters this year too... where is the out cry there? Black on Black shootings happen almost daily in the US yet its treated as its just their culture...🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @TomSwarbrick1 It doesn't. I'm too busy sat at home playing #CallofDuty in my pants with the lights off, the curtains drawn with a can of red bull &amp; packet of Doritos while I sweat it out for a 25 killstreak so I can drop a tactical nuke on some noobs. Fuck going outside... #NotVideoGamesFault<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HillaryClinton Ew, I actually agree with Hillary on something for once. But mental health does play a part somewhat but Video game literally have no connection to shootings and I really destain the idea of a bunch of politicians who have absolutely no idea about gaming to start restricting it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤦🏻‍♂️...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@emilyhewertson Not as fit as Theresa May 😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BernieSanders And it’s people like you who add fuel to the fire with deliberate inflammatory trigger words to cause even bigger divides &amp; tension to benefit your political agenda.  https://t.co/B5re8s6yMA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brianklaas @JuliaHB1 Careful with letting white kids play the upcoming #CallofDuty game which features white phosphorous as a kill streak, they might have the urge to commit a war crime then drop a nuke after getting a 25 kill streak 🤭☢️☢️☢️⚠️⚠️🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SadiqKhan The PM has proposed an Australian points based immigration system... if &amp; when its implemented it will assure we get people with the skills we need. we’ve become too lazy &amp; reliant on immigrants to do our jobs, time we prioritised training &amp;helping unemployed &amp; homeless Brits 1st<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ShelaghFogarty @JuliaHB1 ”read the first line of my tweet” Okay?...You very vaguely mention “insane gun laws” then swerve to attack &amp; blame trump for shootings which have been happening long before he was in office. it’s America’s fault as a whole, not trump, for their stubbornness with the 2nd amendment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DVATW Why are they fucking dancing with him?  They can easily overpower him in seconds.🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@charlieINTEL It's stupid moaning about white phosphorus being a killstreak when a nuke is also(napalm has been too). Why is that acceptable but white phosphorus isn't? It makes no logical sense.🤦🏻‍♂️ the snowflakes need to get over their miserable lives, its just a game, Stop ruining everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProSyndicate Go home, you're drunk! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyhewertson Make the most of it because once we leave the EU the sun will implode, the sea will turn to acid and there will be a bikini shortage so you wont be able to go to the beach for a while, if ever again. It's true because remainers said it.😂😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC @clivebull No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidLammy @BBCr4today Labour is in no position to lecture on antisemitism😂 He was given an interview because FREE SPEECH is supposed to exist for EVERYONE not just the far-left. Censorship is a key element of fascism. if you don’t like what he says then debate him to dismantle his views but you wont.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What. The. Fuck. They actually told a kid what his parents say is wrong... talk about indoctrination.😬 Children’s minds are like sponges PLEASE can we teach them about important vital things we dont teach but should like first aid, taxes, bills, mortgages etc...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon A sensible course of action would be for the Prime Minister to withdraw YOU from the office of mayor of London.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheNotoriousMMA dont embarrass yourself again. I want you to fuck him up but shit, you went in the first time underprepared, stiff &amp;rusty from a long time off. you've had an even bigger time off since then &amp; fought no one. at least have 3-4 fights to warm-up, we know how it will go otherwise.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AyoCaesar Their skin colour &amp; gender have fuck all to do with anything...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Femi_Sorry why is the left so full of pure hatred?🤨 they can't hide it either. if they try to physically hide their hate, it slips out verbally and if they can't restrain themselves physically then they put on a hoodie &amp; cover their faces and attack anyone with a different opinion... 😐<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TitaniaMcGrath well, there is an easy fix for that. seeing as we can identify as whatever we want nowadays and no one can question it we will have to start identifying white babies as 'coloured' so to tip the scales of balance &amp; equality.  is that acceptable? 🤨😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking this is why the UK is turning to shit and Brexit has made no progress... MPs and too busy with trivial &amp; irrelevant issues and won't tackle the real &amp; important problems in this country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>dread to think of the millions spent on this to come to a conclusion that was obvious &amp; should have never been questioned in the first place!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's because knife &amp; gun crime are also part &amp; parcel of living in a big city... Along with terrorism. we need the endless non-British culture festivals marching through our streets to hide the bloodstains &amp; bodies I guess🙄 khans priorities are a disgrace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyoCaesar The US isn't asking them to come into their country ILLEGALLY... They're taking it upon themselves to do so. dont be surprised when people break the law&amp; get locked up. They should be in their own countries building their own economies&amp; infrastructure so they won't need to leave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheNewEuropean Bullshit😂 he loved it because he knew he could play victim &amp; milk the situation. he harnesses leavers daily, shouting in their faces with his oversized megaphone just for walking passed him &amp; he follows leaver politicians.

And the only hate I ever see is from you lot, you cant stand anyone who doesn't think or do the same as you and you absolutely HATE it. As for this 67%... you need to add in the rest of the UK's opinion outside of London for once.🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickygervais If this particular religion you speak of is the one I’m thinking of then fuck no am I going to openly criticise it. especially when I’m a poor little peasant. I’d be banned on social media, lose my job, be branded a racist, Nazi, fascist, get milkshaked&amp;attacked by the far-left😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THE EU ISNT A COUNTY! 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️. it's supposed to be a group specifically for 28 nations to peaceful trade... But seems it has other plans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Femi_Sorry you can live &amp; work in most places around the world... it's not some privilege exclusive to the EU.  the good thing is, once we leave we will have the benefit of choosing who we let in, more skilled, more educated people to raise our society up, not let it be flooded &amp; stagnate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @toryboypierce you're poison! you're full of too much hate &amp; bias to present this matter fairly, just spouting lies. #TommyRobinson didnt want to collapse the Leeds case to "stoke up hate" you fool. it was the sentencing, the case was over! you havent even see his video!🤦‍♂️😠<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Femi_Sorry yes, because fighting for free speech is bad🤦‍♂️. TR has literally been charged with doing exactly what MSM does. and it's not inciting violence to say someone who will kill you lives in this house or that house. literally, no British Muslims have attacked or killed as a result.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>at least some good news today... glad someone was freed from their witch hunt sham trial #FalseAccuser<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>no, it's your mind that is all kinds of wrong.  you're the one interpreting a normal innocent photo (from what I assume is the film 'Pay it forward') in a vile twisted sexual way. #KevinSpacey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the case Tommy reported on finished 100% unimpeded with no issue. all were found guilty &amp; justice was served. you can not then find someone guilty over something you claim could have happened to the case that had already finished.  this is crazy! my county is a fucking disgrace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>this government lawyer sounds like the biggest 4Head ever... (4Head as in a twitch emote, not an actual forehead... I'm not explaining it.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ezralevant objection, (desperate &amp; irrelivent) speculation.  defendant gave clear &amp; verifiable evidence he took all the right steps to check whether or not a reporting restriction was in effect. witness statements from court staff admit their publication of a reporting restriction failed 3x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>but look at celebrity or big murder cases... the journalists are packed in the court doorways takes hundreds of photos &amp; pushing &amp; shoving each other &amp; the defendant coming in &amp; out of court.  this court case is about silencing a man for who he is, not about delivering justice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ezralevant what about the hundreds of journalists outside courts of ongoing trials of celebrities or mass murders etc... they push &amp; shove each other &amp; even the defendants walking into court because its so packed at the doorway? you see photos all over TV, newspapers &amp; online the next day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>scary how social media giants have more power than governments. they can manipulate anything because we're so dependent on them, big tech can manipulate elections, peoples way of thinking, what they can&amp; cant see... they can literally mould societies and they do it all unchecked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if one small guy with a phone can cause 'stress' to a rapist gang, what stress did the hundreds of journalists cause to others like cliff Richards or any other defendant that had people photographing them as they walk into court then find their picture all over TV &amp; newspapers???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Fuck, they must be good at stitches &amp; disinfecting then😆. Not seen any news of kids dying from complications of stab wounds which they stitched up themselves like an infection or internal bleeding.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rickygervais Last time i voted parliament basically stuck two fingers up at me, spat in my face &amp; called me a dumb cunt who didnt know what I voted for. then incompetently dragged me through the mud for the past 3 years in the hope I’d change my apparent racist, fascist, Nazi voting decision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmandeepBhogal So embarrassing🤦🏻‍♂️, not only for themselves but the whole UK. It makes us look like right fools &amp; makes us an even bigger laughing stock than they’ve already made us. we cant be taken seriously when we have this lot mugging us off because they can't accept a Democratic vote...🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CountDankulaTV How many people will buy this bath water so they can drink it🤔 you know it will happen. 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Fucking disgusting. Our weak &amp; scared government needs to get its priorities straight&amp;start standing up for us instead of terrorists. Guess this guy should have listened to Sadiq khans message that ”terror attacks are part &amp; parcel of living in a big city” &amp;just let them kill us.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cowellp @realDonaldTrump How?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mfredell88 @realDonaldTrump But... Trump isn't forcing them to come?... told them not to cross...? I don't recall Trump ever telling anyone to cross illegally... Quite the opposite in fact. He said he ”wants them to come in legally, through a process”... That seems fair, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@claymontgirl @realDonaldTrump But... Trump told them not to cross illegally?....... He wants them to come in legally &amp; safely like every other normal person. Trump isn't forcing them to come is he?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@phototechcsj @realDonaldTrump 🤔How? Trump isnt telling them to cross the borders illegally... he is telling them to stop crossing illegally and come in legally &amp; safely like every other normal person. If its anyones fault, its Mexico/South America’s for not fixing their problems &amp; developing their countries.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BorderIrish Everyone has rows now &amp; then... literally everyone. this is only being made into a big deal because its boris. the neighbours weren’t “concerned for the females well being” they just see an opportunity to damage boris &amp; inturn dsmage brexit &amp; also make a few ££ selling the story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NazShahBfd Security would’ve grabbed her the same way &amp; forced her out the premises... but they seemed to be sleeping on the job. what if she had a weapon?

<|startoftext|>@GMB @SwainITV Nice one BBC... Scaring old people into giving you money otherwise you will axe their favourite programs &amp; radio station if they don’t. Their TV is their life.

<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn They did let the people decide in 2016. We are only in this mess because Parliament is remain! None of you prepared for leave because you was too cocky thinking we’d vote to remain. competent politicians would’ve prepare for every outcome so to avoid this shit mess were in now.🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 Yes but if it was someone on the left being mobbed by the right, the left would pressure &amp; force the employer to fire them &amp; they’d make sure they’re censored on social platforms &amp; the left still wouldn’t be happy with that.

<|startoftext|>All these #antiTrump protesters Reeing &amp;screeching vile obscenities at the top of their lungs are the same people who preach about how bad climate change is yet also trash streets with hate banners &amp;pump out gallons of Diesel from their coaches they used to ship in protesters🤦🏻‍♂️😂  https://t.co/4fpLSHOyAV<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ed_7991 @SadiqKhan unfortunately, Sadiq will, most likely, not be going anywhere soon. "London is open" as he keeps preaching... and he needs it to stay open because he relies on flooding London with a particular voter base that will vote him in based simply on his religious background.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thomasburn @SadiqKhan 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Oh my😬, can you be any more obvious!?!?... just when he looks set to become the next PM by miles he is suddenly summoned to court🤔.

<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan but surely this kind of mentality just helps remainers?. if we have a 2nd vote &amp; most leavers dont bother to vote for the same reason as you, it just plays into remainer hands. they have more incentive to vote again, especially with how desperate they are with wanting their way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guyverhofstadt @LibDems @vincecable Hmmm, yes, of course you would be pleased to welcome a bunch of fresh blind fools into your project, much better &amp; easier for you to control willing pro-EU ignorance than try to control defiant anti-EU dissidence.  https://t.co/WquyvF02my<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking How about Jeremy Corbyn resigns too? As well as half or more of the current MPs in Parliament who are just as incompetent &amp;selfish?...

<|startoftext|>@DominicFarrell Whats more disgusting is the fact the left is outright denying it even happened. If/when these trendy left-wing milkshake attacks become trendy left-wing acid attacks will the left will still deny it then?

<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking the real national security threat is the fact our weak government is willingly allowing the Chinese government to using the 5G network to spy on us😑.

<|startoftext|>@DavidLammy unfit to hold public office yet his countrys economy is flourishing.

<|startoftext|>@LBC @darrenadam Knife crime is just one side effect that has freely snowballed because of government incompetence &amp; our weak &amp;sensitive society full of false brexit uncertainty. police also too scared to stop &amp;search in fear of being called racist &amp; too busy policing thoughts, opinions &amp;tweets.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage @brexitparty_uk no one wants to vote for a single issue party, thought you’d have learned that already. why bother with another party for brexit when you already had one(which you tried to sabotage).

<|startoftext|>@NadiaA2015 @Channel4News @Jacob_Rees_Mogg it's probably because he has a different opinion on Brexit to you. remainers often find it sickening that people actually have different views &amp; opinions to them for some reason. he probably finds your #'s in your name equally nauseating.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bbcquestiontime honestly, at this point just vote the shit through as long as we leave. we can change the WA once we leave anyway. the remainers are so desperate &amp;selfish that they dont care for the uncertainty they're causing to our economy&amp; businesses because they cant accept they lost a vote.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GuidoFawkes Boris &amp;Mogg are the only MPs i support, but as of yesterday, I don't really have much faith in any MPs, to be honest. wheres the hard reset on parliament? the only options I can see to get Brexit moving is either the queen dissolves parliament or guy fawkes is resurrected🤔🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BBCSounds don't promote this pathetic bullshit on my twitter timeline... not even a 10year FBI investigation could find any evidence! so why believe a weak 1-sided documentary? it has no evidence, thats why it tries to win people over through shock factor by over detailing sexual acts!🤦‍♂️😡  https://t.co/P4xqXtnfy7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucasrush @BBCSounds Bollocks do you, stop virtue signalling. that pathetic one-sided documentary has no evidence, they've just tried to win over people with shock factor by over detailing sexual acts. they see an opportunity with the #MeToo era being easily manipulated&amp; took advantage of it for $$$.<|endoftext|>

She was still one of our strongest leaders we’ve had. Unlike all these pathetic selfish weak MPs we have now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonColerainey @bartfto @windsortravel1 @lbcbreaking You do realise the reason there is a ‘Shitstorm’ in the first place is because it is remainers trying to deliver brexit...🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UKIPWebb4London @UKIP @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @Jacob_Rees_Mogg is one of the only MPs i genuinely like.... but i guess all MPs disappoint &amp; let us (the people) eventually...  https://t.co/Khluc15HHT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage You should have stuck with @UKIP 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking well of course they have.😒🙄🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SerWinterGaming don't worry, Brexit means Brexit! :)   wait, the UK government &amp; politicians are EU cucks so yeahhh... The UK is fucked🤦‍♂️  https://t.co/O1nEgPqucE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking A petition which can be signed by anyone around the world whether they’re a UK citizen or not. the petition can be more easily manipulated than play-dough. 1-use emails can be generated in seconds to spam sign the petition &amp;the remainers are desperate &amp; petty enough to do it too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrossieGore @Twitch Just go for the top job of Becoming CEO of twitch😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anna_Soubry @metpoliceuk And for keeping you shielded from being challenged on your views &amp; asked simple questions in public🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @MatthewStadlen None of the above🤨. none of them deserve it or are even capable. No one in this current cabinet should be PM. The only Torys I support for PM are either @BorisJohnson or @Jacob_Rees_Mogg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucyhough33 @LBC Yet the #PutintothePeople numbers didnt even come close to the 17.4m people who voted in the democratic referendum to LEAVE. The march couldn’t even match their own voting numbers from the 2016 ref🤦🏻‍♂️. A few hundred-thousand people &amp; a easy forged petition represents nothing.😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SebastianEPayne If you say so😆. But its still nowhere near as big as the biggest voting turn out in British electoral history... of which 17.4m people voted to leave the EU, which you now want to over turn because your side lost the democratic vote... sorry that you lost buddy, move on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theresa_may And what about the 25,000 ISIS fighters you allowed to come back to the UK?.... who will deal with them? Isis is far from defeated...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking That’s because they’re all over here!what was it again?, 25,000 ISIS fighters were allowed to come back? They’ve literally been beheading people &amp; killing British soldiers, yet our government welcomes them back🤦🏻‍♂️. Its not as if they was on a 3-week bender with the lads in Zante🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon ... you can’t find police to tackle the daily knife attacks but some how you can find extra police at the click of your fingers to guard mosques from an attack that happened on the other side of the world. how very strange🤔🤗🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon If you’re going to act upset for us, least make it believable😒. also, why no condemnation of such vile terrorism?... strange how your tone changes depending on who commits the attacks. What was it you said again about London terror attacks? Part &amp; parcel, right?...  https://t.co/G1eMyG4mtr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KTHopkins New-New Zealand founded early 2019 🇳🇿<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB @kategarraway @benshephard @CharlotteHawkns @RichardAArnold It all depends on what your brain is expecting to hear. We were given two options so our brains where only expecting to hear either one (or both). If you just ask ‘what do you hear?’ then the answer will be completely different to either option given. Keep up btw this is so old😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ByDonkeys @ShelaghFogarty @theresa_may oh dear, you chose the side which lost in a democratic vote... get over it, that’s democracy. Plenty of dictatorships you can go live in🙄. Also May isnt a ‘hostage of the hard right’... first off hostages need to have value and secondly if she was a ‘hostage’ we’d left already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC DAMN RUSSIAN BOTS!😂... no but seriously, the remainers May be out in force for last ditch efforts to stop brexit but if 1M people marching in the streets to stop a war didn’t work I hardly think a petition from the side that LOST a democratic vote will have any sway 😂nice try👏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC It’s vandalism in Chavy city, not a terror attack🤦🏻‍♂️ stop trying to inflate a minor problem to cause issues &amp; tension to benefit leftist agendas. the reason people have started doing shit like this is because you censor them from having fair &amp; open debate &amp; ability to criticise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB @SwainITV Pathetic...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyoCaesar @OwenJones84 Jokes on you, far-right can’t read 😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeaveEUOfficial @Nigel_Farage He has no power anymore... he barely has any supporters, the only ones left are those who are greatful for him getting us the brexit ref, he just self destructed after that and lost any sway he had in British politics. All he is good for is pestering the EU like a fly on shit😂🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaheemKassam Honestly, I like boris but what exactly has he done since he quit cabinet?... I much prefer @Jacob_Rees_Mogg but he isn’t on that list. yes he is a back bench MP but he has a lot of public support, more than anyone on the front bench.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan It’s because he isn’t the ‘king’ lol. he is one of the big boys, sure, but king? Meh... maybe king of the youtubers in the UK but not the whole of youtube.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GMB Enough with this ‘gender role’ crap🤦🏻‍♂️ Its just more lefty cancerous BS that damages kids mental health. If a kid doesn’t draw a pair of tits on a firefighter it doesn’t mean they are thinking in their head “only boys can be firefighters”. kids literally dont give a shit about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Calling someone a traitor is now a crime but actually being a traitor isn’t🤦🏻‍♂️👏🏻. or at least it isn’t when it fits a certain agenda🙄. Also, its funny how the left can freely call anyone who disagrees with them a nazis but its a huge crime when it gets reversed just one time...🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Biggest load of bullshit. Facebook is full of sick vile things like animal cruelty etc &amp; its ignored. They’d rather be petty &amp; shutdown free speech&amp; police peoples thoughts to shutdown fair &amp; open debate to keep it one sided in favour of left wing agendas. Censoring is dangerous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB That defeats point of being transgender... you literally TRANSITION from one gender to the other... a ‘gender-neutral’ changing room for trans is literally one of the biggest insults🤔... we all see how the one trans person freaked out just for being called ma’am accidentally🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking How does that help anything?... more suppression &amp; concoring just leads to more violence...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theresa_may YOU (the government/establishment/authorities) created this. you ignore &amp;cover up the real problems that has lead to this rise in reactionary violence. You force people down this route because you shut down/censor their voice to debate, question or criticise &amp; even imprison them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 I wonder if you’ll ever stop being so full of hatred towards everyone who has even the slightest difference in views or opinion to yours.

<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 Oh come off it... even if they did put an Islamic terrorist childhood photo up, you’d be just as irate &amp; still call it racist.

<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage That alcohol will still be in your system in the morning...so you’re going to be protesting drunk?

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews @SadiqKhan All I’ve seen today is this this mug all over social media &amp; MSM milking the absolute shit out of the New Zealand massacre for his own gain... he literally has no respect!... at least he found the missing police numbers &amp; the funding for them he needed....🤔  https://t.co/xxtarBtkSV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HammettKath @TomKibasi @krustysghost @BBCNewsnight YES! Fight!

Tut tut tut!🤦🏻‍♂️  https://t.co/g3J3JTdOLp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ezralevant Well of course Sargent street would say he believes that!... he will obviously try to save his arse at every opportunity than admit he was deliberately targeting tommy &amp; his kids... is that judge really that naive?🙄🤦🏻‍♂️ but then again, they are all part of the same establishment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Terror attacks on our streets &amp; stadiums. Sadiq: its all part &amp;parcel, we have to live with it. Terror attack across the other side of the world... Sadiq: I’m locking down &amp; fortifying every mosque in London! Soon fliped his tone... wonder why...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bbcquestiontime Lmao, bbcqt has always had accusations of planting actors in the audience and this guy really does makes you wonder if it is actually true😂. if it is then at least hire an actor who has done real acting &amp; is believable. not someone who is an out of work pantomime Vilian 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guyverhofstadt Ew. I actually agree with the EU for a change 😂  https://t.co/lQdRaInul6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ezralevant Can’t show weakness??... they haven’t seen the state of knife &amp; gun crime then🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ Or the amount for Islamic terrorist/jihadi isis fighters freely roaming our streets... 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ezralevant That would happen when you’re targeted by police &amp; they intimidate your children with 8-10 cops saying they will arrest you for nothing but watching football on tv &amp; having a day out with your children then be forcefully removed from not just the pub but the whole area...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ezralevant they knew he was coming to that match way before match day. make no mistake, the police were thoroughly briefed on  Tommy &amp; his views before hand. The cops didn’t have to mention his views to intimidate his kids, the cops abused their power to bully tommy because of who he is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ezralevant You don’t have to mention his views to attack &amp; target him... the police know very well of Tommy’s views... they knew when &amp; where he’d be that day because they’d go out their way to track him. make no mistake, they were Thoroughly briefed on him because they knew he’d be there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ezralevant Probably been warned about his job being at risk if he doesn’t get in line with the Cambridge cops side of events 🤷🏻‍♂️ wouldn’t surprise me, they already deleted evidence...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrueGeordieTG I hope its not one sided &amp; full of ignorance. There is no evidence after all... innocent till proven guilty. just because the documentary is full of detailed descriptions of cheek spreading🍑 doesnt mean its true. a quick google search can pick apart their stories anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking good, no deal is the only option. if no deal is taken off the table for good and theres no extension to the leave date and no one wants mays deal and there wont be another deal, especially in 16 days... whats left? remain? HA... remaining is NOT an option either. its a betrayal!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking rejecting no-deal is like going to walk through a door but you take the actual doorway away so you can't leave the room...🤦🏽‍♂️just what the remainers want... they must have a right hard on after this.🙃 the vote MPs really want now that no-deal is off the table...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Can’t help but laugh 😂... after all, the UK government/establishment/politicians are the biggest laughing stock of the world, why stop now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ezralevant Yet the only disorder that day came from the police, in particular that mouthy cop in the cap who told Tommy to shut up while he was on his radio. And no one even knew Tommy was there in that pub at that exact time apart from the police because they was following him...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking No deal is LITERALLY the only option left🤦🏻‍♂️. if this vote today to stop a no deal is passed then the government will have betrayed the people &amp; brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet Imagine thinking the biggest issue in society is there not being enough genders or shouldn’t even be given one. Then become so obsessed with it that you try to create genderless AI... when AI is genderless anyway because it’s...AI...🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB Growing a monobrow isn’t really body positivity🤨. She still drew on her normal eye brows with her makeup but couldn’t even commit to the full monobrow.😅<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Can you get any more petty?...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheSimpsons absolutely pathetic. #LeavingNederland is a one sided documentary with absolutely no evidence. How can you be so ignorant to believe it. just because it focused on graphic details, doesn’t make it factual... they tried to make you believe them with shock factor.🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattfrei @danreed1000 #leavingnetherland  doesn’t make me want to turn off his music at all because I’m not that petty😂. nor am I that ignorant to believe a one sided documentary with no facts or evidence to back up any of their allegations. It’s easy to accuse a dead man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itvnews @GMB Not to worry, all 3 of her kids are alive &amp; well... it was just isis doing it’s monthly round up for new recruits from their bride cattle😂 give it a few weeks and she’d be pregnant again ready for the next batch 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Not to worry, all 3 of her kids are alive &amp; well... it’s isis just did it’s monthly round up for new recruits from their bride cattle😂 give it a few weeks and she’d be pregnant again 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Why is he telling us?... shes still not coming back here no matter how hard he tries to make us, the UK, feel guilty as if its our fault because we refused to let her return. Thousands die daily &amp;are ignored, this babies death is publisised for political guilt tripping, shameful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidkurten @UKIP Schools are supposed to educate kids, not confuse them🤦🏻‍♂️. Educate kids on important &amp; necessary things like taxes, bills, mortgage etc... we’d have less people in debt &amp; struggling. Also first aids should be mandatory, it will take such a strain off the NHS &amp; benefit everyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MightyMaxUK @OwenJones84 It’s a shame Islam doesn’t agree with your ‘fixed it’ meme. 🤷🏻‍♂️  https://t.co/DITucarfaC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@babyjaynie @kateprewett @GMB Where’s the evidence then? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nuttynicjo @kateprewett @GMB Yet there was never any evidence found? the 2 guys said under oath in court at the age of 21, Micheal never touched them. Now they appear in a one sided documentary with laughing mums &amp; nothing but graphic detail of cheek spreading to get the shock factor... thats not evidence.🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kateprewett @GMB Wheres the evidence he did anything? He was acquitted of all charges, the guys said under oath He didnt touch them. The one sided documentary has no proof. Just 2 greedy mens words against a dead man. You really think because they detailed cheek spreading that it is evidence?🤦🏻‍♂️🤣  https://t.co/Oyg6f9M2xp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KTHopkins @OwenJones84 Another thing we can also do without being taught in schools is religion. Teach kids about taxes, bills, mortgage, loans etc... then we’d have less people struggling &amp; in debt. Also first aid should also be mandatory, it will take a massive strain off NHS &amp; benefit everyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking There was no contempt. the defendants tried to get their case thrown out for it but it was denied immediately. Tommy was thrown in prison in 5mins &amp;his human rights breached&amp;staved in solidarity for months. Then his case fell apart&amp;thrown out. There’s no ground to imprison him!🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan One sided piece of shit documentary. all it was about was their ever changing stories against a dead man to get money. graphic details of spreading cheeks for shock factor🙄. the mother laughing about it &amp; the guy with Presteigne rings that are “too traumatic to look at” 💍🤦🏻‍♂️😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon youth are out of control because there is no authority thanks to equality. The kids think theyre be on the same level as mature adults, so they have no respect. Also over use of asking for consent for everything destroys discipline &amp; authority, kids need to be told, not asked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon ‘Sucked into knife crime’ because they was excluded, yeah okay. When I got excluded at 15-16 I was sat at home masturbating&amp;playing violent! games on Xbox. only time I touched a knife while I was excluded was to make a sandwich. Masturbation is the key to stopping knife crime🤔😂  https://t.co/TNGEIskvmg<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hendopolis He deliberately targeted &amp; intimidated tommy Robinson’s innocent young children with 5 guys &amp; a pitbull and DOX’s their address to open them up to violent attacks👏🏻 very clever. he even waited until Tommy was in Finland.

<|startoftext|>@IainDale @GerardBattenMEP @IainDale do your homework &amp; look at both sides before embarrassing yourself🤦🏻‍♂️. try talking to Tommy yourself by inviting him on your show. surly it’s better to openly debate different views (something the left struggle with) rather than have one sided &amp;unquestionable censorship.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC @IainDale Ughh, the ‘hate everything British’ guy... he can piss off. he is nothing but a hate filled racist who literally teaches classes in university about hating &amp;destroying anything &amp; everything British.

<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking What an absolute waste of time &amp; money! Stop chasing this lost cause.

<|startoftext|>@LBC LOL. Maybe, if he didnt decide to abandon everything after the referendum. He has no chance now.

<|startoftext|>@LBC @TomSwarbrick1 What the actual fuck... is there any point to sending people to prison if it only ends up being a fucking day trip?. no wonder stabbing &amp; gun crime has skyrocketed... there’s no threat of punishment.

<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Fucking idiots🤦🏻‍♂️ there will be no deal! Youre fools if you think we will get a deal now, let alone one that benefits us.

<|startoftext|>@Imamofpeace No, we have to let them in and welcome them in with open arms otherwise it’s incredibly racist on our part...  https://t.co/yjYxt4rHpA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @MaajidNawaz We didn’t ‘export’ her you prat! She abandoned the UK state and fucked off of her own free will to join her new Paradise state... the Islamic STATE... so she isn’t stateless, she is isis’s problem. Send her extremist father &amp; the rest of her family over to her in paradise! 🖕🏼🙄👍🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking About time someone took some control around here. thankfully it was the ERG brexiteers and not some sore loser remainers. No deal is the only deal now, the remainers made sure of that, the fucking idiots forced the very thing they didnt want😂😂 no deal is not as bad as they say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickFerrariLBC  https://t.co/h37GBtcyEV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShelaghFogarty She isnt our problem &amp; she isnt stateless either. she willingly joined the Islamic STATE. Thats her state now, not the UK. shes complicit in her new states actions &amp; openly shows no remorse or regret. She only want back in the infidel UK state to take advantage of its luxuries...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Of course she fucking would...😂😂😂. She isn’t stateless she willingly went to join the Islamic STATE!... the one true state. she only want a UK infidel citizenship to sponge off our infidel NHS &amp; other luxuries our civilised infidel society has to offer. Send her family to her!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB It’s so blatant that he only said yes to bringing her back because he fears he might get called racist &amp; lose his acting career for saying she shouldn’t come back.  https://t.co/zuZ90HmILw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon London is open&amp; look at the appalling state its in because of it. forced diversity in such a cramped city is just causing clashes because everyone is so different &amp; incompatible with each other, it doesnt work. You’re a disgraceful &amp;incompetent weasel with blood on your hands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Haha gutted. Stay there! Her child will only grow up with its mothers mindset of hate for the UK (unless to sponge the NHS) and loyalty &amp; love for isis. Keep the baby there to save it the trip in 15years time when it follows in mummy’s footsteps to fight for isis &amp; avenge daddy.  https://t.co/KH1uQsydRy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>SPOILERS! Sean Bean dies within the 1st season😒😴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Yikes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardjsS14 @keanosalegend @LBC no pweasee!, I’m not a wacist!😭 &lt;— is that the answer you wanted? 😂 its pointless asking a question like that because I dont think anyone, racist or not, would actually admit to being a racist🤔. Are you a racist too Richard?  https://t.co/VceE2wyqQp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardjsS14 @keanosalegend @LBC It’s not a debate, it’s a simple question that is easily answered. You can’t brand someone a racist&amp; not give evidence to backup your claim. If Tommy was racist he’d have been arrested for it years ago. would you brand someone a murderer when they have never murdered anyone?...🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2dollarcasio @LBC What for?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IainDale @Jacob_Rees_Mogg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB Victim? Fuck off. She literally said she has NO REGRETS &amp; still supports isis. her reason to come back here is for free health care &amp; free UK citizenship for her baby &amp; to sponge off the tax payer while raising her baby with hatred for the UK... ever heard of a Trojan horse? 🤦🏻‍♂️  https://t.co/RSy2aEv66W<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IainDale @afneil Just another reason to scrap the tv license, less&amp; less people watch tv. We have the internet now. BBC is just going down hill, not even EastEnders is worth a watch anymore. Not to mention panorama being a falsehood show full of scripted interviews &amp; god knows what crap&amp; lies. :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC FUCK. NO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chriswa73463315 @KateWilton1 @Jacob_Rees_Mogg I am a Tommy Robinson supporter and I also support JRM. A lot more of us support both than you think. But I do agree with you that a majority of uni professors are hard left wing and they do push their leftist thinking onto their students &amp; manipulate them for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UberFacts Wait... someone had to have tested this out some how to know it works... 😳🤔😆 hmmmm....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Fuck off if you think I’m even going to consider either of these options. NO DEAL is the only option now. We can still negotiate a deal after we leave. we aren’t going to cut all ties &amp; communication with the EU once we leave, like the remainers seem to believe🙄🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking An incompetent PM with confidence in an incompetent transport secretary... makes perfect sense.  https://t.co/Zw9HDNl0H3<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Fucking disgrace! Vile people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shame that it’s not the full close up clip. it’s insane that no MSM will even report this. MSM seems to just brush the yellow jackets under the carpet as much as possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KateHoeyMP @BBCNews @SkyNewsBreak Of course they won’t cover this... &amp; they certainly won’t cover the fact that today a yellow vest protester had his hand literally blown off by a grenade from the French riot police. I see it live on RT’s live stream of the protest on YouTube. They show it live raw as it happens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking knowing how stubborn he is, he probably wasn’t that willing tbh😂.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Assisted suicide should be legalised. It’s THEIR life &amp; they should have a choice to end it and those who assist in the suicide should not have any repercussions. It’s cruel to deny someone the right to peacefully end their life. It’s legalised in Switzerland so why not here?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @IainDale if a leftist suggested this, then it would be acceptable, righteous &amp; they’d be a strong person for standing up to hatred &amp; discrimination. but the moment someone on the right uses this leftist tactic then it’s pathetic, stupid &amp; they’re a snowflake...🤔 double standards much 🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @ianpaynesport I’m still watching the film so fuck you. 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan He was right to defend Liam Neeson👍🏼 but wrong to attack &amp; rant about winston Churchill, that was unnecessary🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@freestyler8701 @DayeHibbert @LBC Liam is clearly saying he’d didn’t care what the rapist looked like... a rapist is a rapist and a rapist who happened to be black raped his friend and in a moment of rage he wanted revenge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Do you feel empowered by dramatising this to try &amp; ruin his career &amp; life for him admitting he was wrong?. it’s not about ‘black people’... it’s about 1 rapist who happened to be black &amp; Liam wanted revenge for his friend in a moment of rage, like any other person would feel too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB he literally did NOTHING but admit he was wrong about thoughts he had, in a moment of rage, of getting revenge on&amp; killing his friends rapist, who just happened to be black. Do you really think if the rapist was white he’d just shrug &amp; that’s unlucky?... he’d flip his shit also.  https://t.co/7gwvHZhYbt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking just another pathetic petty result of this witch hunt snow flake society we live in now. You make 1 small mistake in life&amp; people find out, you better know your life &amp; career is OVER! People go out their way to get a 5minute sense of empowerment&amp; importance by destroying someone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Petty cunts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oops... well, guess that’s my life over. prison for the rest of my life🙂👍🏼<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC @NickFerrariLBC Yikes, imagine being the one able to brag about banning a cartoon tiger on cereal. Thanks to social media, people are so desperate to be noticed  &amp;be known for something. thats why we end up with people scrambling for tv interviews for unnecessary things rather than real problems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ungi_paul @GMB @MunroeBergdorf How dare you! Gemma Collins in a national treasure! 😂😂  https://t.co/mIuv4hbk3i<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB @MunroeBergdorf we don’t need to go out our way to point out a mannequin or model is trans, it’s irrelevant &amp; unnecessary &amp; can be harmful &amp; confusing to children. Why do we feel the need to forcefully promote trans? They’re a TINY minority trying to fit in but constantly try to stand out🙄 🤦🏻‍♂️😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB @MunroeBergdorf 1) all the time. 2) I don’t give a fuck what colour the mannequins are, I’m there to buy clothes &amp; so should you. Also, I don’t want a 300lb mannequin or model displaying clothes because it promotes obesity as a positive thing. Also transgenderism shouldn’t be promoted either...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@XboxSupport hurry up because my little brother is freaking the fuck out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCNewsnight @Anna_Soubry @nicholaswatt “People are not putting their country first &amp; formost”... ermm... what the fuck do you think we are doing by leaving the EU!????....🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @eddiemair Absolutely fucking not. Career politicians are a cancer! they only care about themselves &amp; advancing their agenda, they have no passion for anything else. Being a politician should be a passion not a job! If money drives you like it did Blair then you are just as corrupt as him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GGXupdates @Sodapoppintv It’s 4:14am in UK... you won’t get up until 6pm now and then you will just ditch and go leech on other streams for the rest of the night 😂  https://t.co/ReuYD9VdsC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anna_Soubry @susannareid100 @piersmorgan If selfishly throwing a tantrum &amp; trying to stop brexit which will severally damage democracy, destroy what little faith people have left in the disconnected establishment &amp; assuring your own party will not get elected for years etc... is ‘wining’ then you must be off you head!🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@David_LFC_ Omg lmfao... I gasped with shock at the end because the ending was so unexpected 😂. I’d like to see the rest of the video it. It felt like there was more to it but it was clipped for dramatic effect. 🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@davidkurten The idea that we have to leave WITH a deal is not true &amp; its distracting everyone. Theres 70days left, Theresa should go to counties outside EU &amp;start trade negotiations. ignore the EU’s demand to not do so before an EU deal, because we won’t get a decent EU deal before we leave!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC @NickFerrariLBC How can “far-right extremists” ‘recruit’ primary children when Most school teachers are left wing ffs.

<|startoftext|>@thecarolemalone @annasoubrymp Just debate them🙄... you’re clearly surperior to them &amp; much more civilised &amp; intelligent so surly you can desmantle their views easily, right?? 😂 by refusing to talk &amp; engage in debate with them about each others views you force them into shouting out because you won’t listen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oliverdarcy So you’re saying the president of America should not be allowed on American tv to talk to America, the nation he is in charge of, simply because the president happens to be Donald trump🤣. People need to put their hate for Donald trump aside and start respecting the presidency😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking It’s fine for the left&amp; politicians to call brexiters Nazi for wanting their country back from the EU (who are basically the Nazi rebranded) but when the tables are turned it’s a horrible vile crime...  https://t.co/0vBeZ76vTc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Don’t be so bloody pathetic! Mummy mummy! A man called me a Nazi!. They are just trying to silence opposition, yet again. But if the government just listened to the people who voted to leave &amp; not fob them off, they wouldn’t have to be marching in the streets shouting. ignorant🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TarekFatah @ezralevant Would you believe there is people who actually defend that stuff and attack anyone who speaks out against it &amp; brands them wacist 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Arrived? No, they have landed on our shores ILLEGALLY. dump them back in France. they made it through enough safe countries with a lot more space, so why come here?(silly question, we all know why). Its also weird how the boats trying to sneak in are only full of men aged 18-35🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking “Get your act together”...No one wants his &amp;Mays deal, it only keeps us under the EU’s control. So May goes back to get a better deal but surprise surprise the EU said fuck off, no more negotiations. So how can we get our act together with no cooperation from the drunken old men?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @afuahirsch Ughh... since when has this vile woman had a show on LBC🙄. She can’t lead Britain’s conversation when all she spouts is hatred for anything British &amp; creates issues by race baiting for attention. I thought putting up with James O’Brien’s arrogance &amp; droning voice was bad enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC That wont help anyone when 95% of the population doesn’t understand how calories work or what they even are... nothing is taught about them in school. we need to educate kids on healthy eating &amp; fitness but we are too busy teaching pointless &amp; meaningless thing such a religion.🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @AndrewCastle63 Because we are a push over nation... nothing great about Great Britain anymore. Everyone is petrified of causing offence. Not to mention illegal immigrants get every benefit, priority schools placements &amp; free housing which they can complain is too small &amp;get a free 5 bed upgrade<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC @MatthewStadlen No. They only created such chaos because the government/ police are too scared to act... there should be a zero tolerance to drones over airports and have them shot down on the first sighting its really not as hard as police Make it out to be. There it’s loads to ways to do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Imamofpeace I bet the feminists&amp; SJW’s are kicking off about this, it’s against everything they stand for in this #Equality era where women aren’t objects, they are equal, if not better, than men &amp;they are independent women who don’t need a man etc etc... wait... feminists said nothing??

<|startoftext|>@JKLDNMAD @sturdyAlex @NicolaSturgeon Haha!, people from all across the world can live, work, study &amp; retire in Europe without being in the EU 🙄... just because we leaving the EU does NOT mean we will just be locked out of Europe &amp; EU citizens will be locked out of the UK...😂🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KillapixTT @UKIP @GerardBattenMEP If we stay, our troops will be surrendered over to the EU’s 4th reich. And then when we kick off about the betrayal of not leaving, the EU will turn our own troops on us with their uniforms &amp; tanks branding the EU flag insignia.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MatthewStadlen @LBC Tony Blair has too much investments &amp; dodgy deals with the EU. if we leave, he will lose out. he is crying for a 2nd ref to protect his personal interests &amp; selfish agenda. brexit also brings a lot of publicity that he is trying to take advantage of to be noticed&amp;feel relevant 😂<|endoftext|>

You can not break something then moan about it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidkurten Theresa needs to stick her finger up to the EU and go off negotiating trade deals with other nations around the world.

<|startoftext|>@GMB If the @Conservatives dont oust May immediately then they are guaranteeing they wont be in power for the next, at least, 20yrs &amp; will pave the way for a labour government to devistate the UK.

<|startoftext|>@P_Mack10 @MayorofLondon He will win. London’s demographic is too high in his favour &amp; he knows it. that’s why he’s so smug&amp; says “London is open” to keep the demographic growing in his favour.

<|startoftext|>@LBC She needs to go, IMMEDIATELY! She only survived because of scared weak MPs &amp; ones on the payroll. Give a week to  @Jacob_Rees_Mogg &amp; @BorisJohnson to put forward brexit plans &amp; vote for one to be leader, even if it’s only temporary emergency power for delivering a real Brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UKIP @GerardBattenMEP These pathetic weak scared Tory MPs cucks who voted in favour for May have guaranteed brexit wont be delivered properly &amp; has 100% paved the way for a labour government within the next year, it’s a disgraceful.

<|startoftext|>@garyvsbrexit @UKIP cant deliver Brexit successfully when there are deliberately ignorant &amp; incompetent remainers in charge of it... no wonder it's a bloody mess. 🤦🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking she has just admitted defeat &amp;basically voted down her own deal... it is time for her to be forced out. she is so ignorantly incompetent and the inaction taken by the rest of the conservatives is a disgrace &amp; risks a labour government, no brexit &amp;/or the break up of the UK! 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamiraEdi @Jacob_Rees_Mogg The only traitors are the ones who signed our nation away to be controlled by unelected drunken EU dictators😂. I voted leave off my own back, I never even heard of mogg until 1year after the ref, so he lead me nowhere. Its remainer May’s incompetence leading us off a cliff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jacob_Rees_Mogg kick May out &amp; take control of the conservatives. No one likes this ignorant incompetence. Torys will not get elected for YEARS! Because of inaction!. Ive had enough of the yapping! put your foot down&amp; take control! even if its just ‘emergency power’ until brexit is delivered!.😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Davis &amp; raab are a straight up, NO. I’ve never heard of raab until recently. The safe choice for the torys is to pick @BorisJohnson but if they want to 100% deliver brexit &amp; stay in power, then @Jacob_Rees_Mogg is the only one. He has the most public support of all torries...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stephenmevans1 @JuliaHB1 @Mohammed_Amin @Amina_Lone @MaajidNawaz @RehmanYasmin @GitaSahgal @thesundaytimes Yikes, if this becomes law, prisons will become very over crowded. but, on the bright side, at least for the left, everyone sent to prison for islamophobia crimes will either leave a full converted Muslim because of the amount of Islamic gangs running the prisons or in a body bag<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeeDogWalker @mattuthompson @LBC How?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy shit! @GunniNelson opened Alex Oliveira forehead up like a tin of beans! That fight was over even if alex managed to get free 😂 #UFC231<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beverleyturner @LBC Okey, ban it. Just as long as the ‘gender/gay confusion therapy’ is also banned, works both ways in my eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @clivebull NO. 🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @mattfrei Nigel destroyed himself. He abandoned brexit &amp; his party, endorsed poor leaders then left UKIP to collapse...then sees UKIP stabilise &amp; grow so he try’s to kick the leader out &amp; collapse UKIP again aswell as insults his remaining supporters &amp; when it failed he cut himself off.😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpaceX @Space_Station Nice photography skills! You had one job! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage @foxandfriends Why would anyone want to hear what you have to say anymore?You’re done. You abandoned pretty much everything...brexit, UKIP&amp; half your supporters. Then recently the rest of your supporters (after insulting them) &amp; then UKIP entirely. All you got is your cushty little radio show😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking The same government that put out an assessment that said the economy would collapse &amp; unemployment will sky rocket the moment article 50 was enacted. yet, it never happened... the economy actually grew &amp; unemployment dropped...🤔 but we’re all still going in the apocalypse!  😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SGteamtommy @lelg @MailOnline Did you see the state of the election results for UKIP with him leading?... surprised they didn’t chuck him out the party on the day of that general election flop 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryBowyer13 @spikedonline @JuliaHB1 Funny how every other person who has been to prison is encouraged &amp; supported &amp; welcomed to turn over a new leaf, change there ways, leave their gangs, stop drug taking &amp; killing etc...&amp; everyone is so proud they change but its a different rule for Tommy, they don’t want that🤨🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Well London is open, right? part n parcel, right? Will people walking down a street be breaking news too? It’s about as common now, thanks mayor khan👍🏼. Maybe khan should focus on fixing London instead of trying to undermine the PM &amp; interfering in Brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SadiqKhan Shut up, stop sticking your nose in and undermining your prime ministers authority! You can’t even run London without at least 3 people being stabbed to death every night... so stick to trying to fix my capital instead of trying to run the UK on the side line, you weasel! 😬🙄🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking they are opening manipulating our government by forcing Theresa mays deal to pass or force a no deal! this makes me want to leave the corrupt EU even more. They are unelected dictators &amp; my government are weak cowardly cucks who give into them demands &amp; cant stand up for us!😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanielBostock4 Honestly, if I don’t see mass protests or ‘peaceful’ riots in the UK, to the scale of the yellow jackets (if not bigger) then it just shows how weak of a nation we are to not stand up for ourselves &amp; our democracy...we don’t deserve a full brexit if we won’t fight for it. #Cucks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage @UKIP You left the day you abandoned brexit &amp; UKIP the 1st time! Every time you stuck your nose into UKIP with leadership endorsements you crippled the party more! &amp;your lack of sticking your nose in brexit left it to be crippled by incompetence &amp; weakness! This mess is all your fault!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @Nigel_Farage It’s Nigal’s fault that UKIP has changed. It was on the brink of Collapse thanks to Him running off &amp; his poor leadership endorsements. If not for @GerardBattenMEP  UKIP would be dead. It has had to adapt to survive. Tommy’s supporters are Nigel’s ex-supporters that he abandoned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Lol. I understand why they didnt want to release it but with the state of brexit due to the governments incompetence, we need to know everything to figure out how to fix the mess. Mays deal won’t pass either so  a change in leadership is needed &amp; they need to be a leaver too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreitbartLondon I think you will find that civilisation will collapse thanks to globalists... the world is no where near ready for it if ever. globalisation will, maybe, be possible once we become an interplanetary civilisation, but that’s a long way off.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KTHopkins this shit makes the sacrifice for freedom in WW2 meaningless. weve handed Europe over to disconnected, unelected drunken old men who are an increasingly militarised, authoritarian &amp; totalitarian police state dictators. We defeated Hitler but we were still conquered anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Imamofpeace literally, no mention of Pakistan anywhere in that tweet and that attack was in Australia so their e-mail is bollocks. I guarantee you will find a lot more colourfully worded tweets about that attack. maybe its a fake phishing e-mail?... its too pathetic to be real surely? 😆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB A journalist has argued that they aren't getting enough attention or work, so they're trying to cause societal divides and problems where there are none!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@talkRADIO @JuliaHB1 @Jacob_Rees_Mogg &amp; @GerardBattenMEP 100% have to be there, otherwise what is the point... May &amp; corbyn are both as cancerous as each other for brexit &amp; the UK. If it’s just may &amp; corbyn then theres absolutely no point in bothering... we will gain nothing from it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peston @ShelaghFogarty @theresa_may We have to pointlessly waste 11 days for a vote we already know will fail... those 11days could be spent replacing may with a brexiteer who has a backbone to stand up for the UK&amp; start telling the EU how its going to happen. If may stays, she will DESTROY the UK &amp; the torys, 100%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KateitaK @Twitch The ads are so damn loud too! They are mainly prime video trailers &amp; it makes me sick having to watch the same thing advertised over &amp; over😑 I mute every time I go into a channel to minimise the inconveniences of the ad 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SGteamtommy @lelg @MailOnline Kids get bullied in school every day, some self harm &amp; even commit suicide over it, they get ignored! No 160k Go found me for them.

<|startoftext|>@AshleighJane_Rs One more day boys... 😓  https://t.co/66f64OGnbp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB again, really!? How many more times will you try to destroy a dead man who lived in a very different time. You attention seeking race baiters need to stop trying to change the past &amp; stop creating racist issues that don’t exist! You do more harm than actual racists, you creat it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeySaaan @saeed6ali A go fund me, why?? Wtf he need money for? You will find kids bully each other in any school, anywhere in the world. I was bullied, where’s my handouts?? The kids both neeed to be sat down in an intervention. Not one forced into hiding &amp; the other given money for being a refugee.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshleighJane_Rs Omg same!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB It’s not a school, it’s a brainwashing institute! Forcing kids into questioning their biological make up has only ever ended in confusion, extremely poor mental health, depression &amp; suicide, aswell as many other problems. Its child abuse, not teaching!.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB ‘Captured’ lol. They will still be let in and be given every benefit going, a house, priority school placements and free use of our NATIONAL health service. Any illegal entrys are ILLEGAL and anyone attempting to enter illegally should never be allowed in. Why not stay in France.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theJeremyVine @JuliaHB1 He is such a troll lmao. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Sorry but youre irrelevant since you randomly ran off at the start of Brexit, turned your back to it &amp; abandoned UKIP &amp; your supporters. You destroyed yourself when you insulted your supporters. You’re too ignorant to realise that Tommys supporters are/were your supporters too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WendyFry_ @ezralevant And they expect to be allowed to enter the US?? They don’t deserve such a privilege with attitude &amp; behaviour like that. this be ignored or used to attack trump by those journalists who deny its an invasion. #NotAnInVasionBecauseTheyAreMilesAwayLOL<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bethesda @Fallout Seems to be more unstable &amp; laggy than the beta for sure!

But I still love fallout.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @darrenadam The EU demanded we can’t even start trade negotiations with the rest of the world while we negotiate an EU deal. We should be negotiating right now with nations around the world... not just the EU who are trying to force a bad deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @darrenadam Really don’t know why we’re getting so caught up on having to leave with a complete EU deal... we can easily negotiate a proper deal after we leave, instead of rushing into a deal that only punishes us so the EU can scare other members from leaving the EU too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theresa_may At least shes brought leavers &amp; remainers together because ain’t no one that agreeing this ‘deal’ is in anyway shape or form good for us 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SadiqKhan is literally trying to  annex London to the European Union. how he is allowed to run off to Brussels for secret meetings with the dictatorial EU leaders &amp; completely undermine the PM &amp; #Brexit ?

<|startoftext|>@AlinityTwitch CAN WE COPY STRIKE @Trainwreckstv !?... He would make a cute 2nd throw-away husband for you to acquire another green card for your collection. Only need to keep him for 2-3 weeks until you get the green card then you can divorce him. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn Our armed forces have struggled for years and no one bothered, so why now? Just because Tommy Robinson is bringing awareness to the horrible state of our army &amp; it being the day of remembrance, labour crawls out the woodwork to take advantage of this day for cheap political gain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreitbartLondon @ezralevant what is the point of a nation then? Just strip away borders&amp; dismantle the nation. especially if a leader of a nation is calling its people who are proud of &amp; want their home nation to be as prosperous &amp; happy as it can be, as treasonous. It’s the leader committing real treason.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustMeBeingMe4 @JuliaHB1 @jeremycorbyn @UKLabour Please teach your leader some respect Cathy 🙄......Thank you 🕊🌹<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wakeywhite @JuliaHB1 @Slaven167 @jeremycorbyn Yikes, you’re actually trying to justify his blatant disrespect. The man couldn’t even bring himself to wear a normal poppy.

<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn actually turnt up at the #RemembranceSunday commemorations wearing a burgundy rain coat with a hood!, at least the rest of the politicians had the decency &amp; respect to wear black...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kellymagsamen Well I don’t exactly see any other world leaders there either?. Ive seen more footage of trump in France than I have of my weak frail prime minister Theresa May, she probably shattered her bones trying to get out her car...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SGteamtommy @lelg @MailOnline Wow, the government should just put out an official statement declaring how fucking scared of Tommy they are... these sneaky tactics to silence him are just gaining him support lol, idiots are digging their own grave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @ShelaghFogarty so it's now cultish for our nation to dedicate 1 day a year to pay respect to the sacrifice of thousands of soldiers who fought and died so nonces like you &amp; O'Brien can have the freedom to sit there and chat shit on the radio all day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @eddiemair Personally he should abstain and allow William to step up. But if he becomes king then it’s important for him to speak out... especially with the pathetic state of the country at the moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Wow, the harm this will do to young minds will be so damaging&amp; confusing. There is only 2 genders (Male &amp; female.

<|startoftext|>@manny_ottawa @ezralevant Normalising mental Health problems. Can’t wait to see 13 year old legally allowed to identify as 21 so they can go clubbing and drink alcohol then end up as single parents by the age of 14 🤦🏻‍♂️  https://t.co/eRlFSKoy8T<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @realDonaldTrump BOOYYYYYY! you expect trump to take peoples gun away!? LOL! ANY president attempting to do that will start a civil war. But something needs to be done because the shootings are getting a bit much now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC The guy was going on about the caravan not being an issue because its miles away... where do you think they are heading?, where do you think they will end up in a few weeks!? Trump gave a completely fair answer, can come in but come in LEGALLY just like every other normal person!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Trump was in the right. That guy had his chance to speak &amp; his question answered. he is very disrespectful, especially the way he yanked the mic way from that girl. There are others there who want to ask questions too. People are so blinded by hatred for trump,they ignore reason.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JagexBreezy So all the special trimmed &amp; herald armours that give fortunate comps from clues will be removed? I assume there will be replacement items to continue getting fortunate comps? Also does the update effect mage &amp; range armour &amp; weapon drops from monsters &amp; clues?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC imagine having to result to asking the public to hunt down thugs. Meanwhile hundreds of police are sat at desks policing ’mean’ tweets. One day something might click the the governments head... but how many more need to be attacked &amp; stabbed to death in the meantime?🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SadiqKhan @metpoliceuk @elliereeves Stop pushing the blame, you incompetent weasel! You want more police on the streets to fight crime?... take them out of the office from hunting for mean tweets and other bollocks and place them on the streets! I don’t know how you sleep at night with so much blood on your hands!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC A disrespectful act, obviously. but to arrest them is unnecessary... a police liaison visit would have sufficed. Perhaps focusing on cracking down on the Grenfell tower aid fund fraudsters should be a priority... the incompetence on dealing with that real  issue is disgraceful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB She’s on the right track but still completely WRONG. Social media didn’t stab those kids and it’s not police cuts. There is more than enough police to fight the knife crime but they can’t because they are at T a desk policing social media sites for mean tweets! It’s pathetic!😠🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Channel4 @Nigel_Farage @krishgm @DavidGauke @BarryGardiner @CarolineLucas Lets not forget the paid audience actors aswell as at least 95% of the audience deliberately being remain anyway 😴😴😴😴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking It wasnt exactly the most tasteful or respectful thing to have done but to actually arrest them?Meh...bit much in my opinion. Its a waste of police time, they got more important real crimes to focus on. A liaison officer popping round to have a word would have been enough.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn Torys are failing them &amp; you are brainwashing them... don’t try act like you will do anything good for this country.

<|startoftext|>@LBC Leave him alone... what is there to gain from dragging him through headlines, especially after he apologised... what more do you want from him?

<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Anyone else get the feeling that the bombs were deliberately planted/duds to make a big political attack on trump to tarnish him in the run up to the mid-term elections??. seems too much of a coincidence &amp; only favours the democrats... they are the only ones to gain from this🤨🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RuneScape This is a map of OLD SCHOOL...if I win this map I’m legit going to carve zeah &amp; fossil island out... then it would be ruined, so I’d have to just bin the whole thing 🤔🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking A terrorist going around intentionally killing people and you’re all sat there wondering whether or not it was lawful to kill him or not for doing so? Fucking idiots... how much money was wasted on this???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theresa_may Proud &amp; grateful but seize their phones &amp;belongings and throw them out of the army &amp; in the gutter because of a photo... fucking pathetic. This government constantly shits all over the patriots &amp; armed forces of this nation, it’s disgraceful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBC Oh dear... having to result to an atomic level to justify a mental disorder is sad, can we please help them?. There are &amp; always will be 2 genders, you can transition between them fine, but you’re still either Male or female. It’s wrong to entertain this mental illness as normal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Skiddler But the disclaimer on his streams states that gross gore is just a character? 😆<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC @MatthewStadlen Who would you vote for if you absolutely had to?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCOne @bbcdoctorwho I’m the doctor, when people need help I... point out I’m a woman &amp; how I’m more unpowered because of it... my other bodies were sexist pigs!... did I mention I’m a woman? Oh &amp; my companions are transgender, pansexual &amp; non-binary, I am a woman too. Thanks for hijacking the show😠<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbcworldservice What’s next is, hopefully their natural mothering instincts kick in and they realise feminism is nothing but a cancer on our society, biological instincts &amp; mental health. ‘What next?’... to me that is pretty much  inciting &amp; condoning the killing of Male babies... it’s sick!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC They do love to stand extremely close to the fairway so it’s not exactly suprising someone got donked. w...why is this news?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KTHopkins Never heard of this guy before but he speaks a lot of sense in that clip... ima look him up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Spreading crap like ‘we are all going to die’ the apocalypse is coming&amp;the world(at least the bubble world of the EU remainers)will end in hell fire &amp; plagues etc... its a selfish OTT desperate attempt to scare &amp;put fear into the average person into changing their mind. Pathetic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IbbyIsmail1 @BrexitTory_ @jeremycorbyn A ‘diverse cabinet’ does not make a good or effective cabinet... just a colourful one. why should anyones skin colour give them a free pass or take priority over whether or not they are actually good/qualified for the job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn Tell that to the bridge attack &amp;  Manchester arena bombing victims... oh, and the Jews you hate so much...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanMortimer2 @LBC White pedos are majority lone wolfs &amp; are dealt with instantly. where as child rape gangs, which are undeniably majority Muslim, are ignored &amp; protected for the sake of diversity... naively shutting down debate by crying racism when someone speaks out just hurts more young girls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RenierRobert @LBC That was a sky news interview.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_arolin_e77 @LBC White pedos are dealt with at a click of a finger &amp; are almost always lone wolfs. where as the Asian (Pakistani Muslim) pedos make up almost all child rape gangs, of which are ignored, covered up &amp; protected simply because of their ethnicity. why is wanting justice a bad thing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @Nigel_Farage is too naive to realise all the Tommy supporters are/were Nigel supporters. until he betrayed us all &amp; ran off. surprising, considering he spent 20+years to get brexit then lets it fall part. He is now irrelevant &amp; lost all his supporters. I’m disappointed in him😕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vesse94 @jagexBakingaZ @TracyRoshLuna @Jagexdamo @JagexPaulB @JagexWing @JagexAlec @RuneScape They could put cape-like wings on the  vampyre outfit but not a quest/master quest cape... hmmmmm...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Laughing because they just realised ‘oh shit, he fucking has as well! LOL we all feel like mugs, he he he he he he’ 😂😂 trump haters can’t be seen to praise him though, so they have to laugh it off to save face, it’s okay. Bless em 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn Free free free free freeeeeee! I can already sense the collapse of our economy through labours tweets... very fucking scary. Lets hope they never actually get in to make it a reality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dapperlaughs Fucking ‘gender aggression’... wait, she is right...SHE IS being gender aggressive. A female, attacking a Male, simply for being a Male &amp; allocating space for his bollocks to breath🤔. Feminism is not about equality, it’s about superiority... by violent force it seems too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB @RebeccaCNReid @piersmorgan @Tess_Holliday Fat women can’t complain if someone points out the fact that being fat IS UNHEALTHY but not bother to help themselves... it’s not piers fault they couldn’t hide from hearing the truth by turning the channel over fast enough. Truth hurts, but at least it’s not unhealthy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMPBoltonCentre This is so muggy. Completely embarrassing for the nation &amp; the police force. 🙄🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @mrjamesob that is exactly what James does on his show. If you drone on the radio daily that brexit is MONUMENTALLY(he loves that word) bad &amp;will cause an apocalypse etc etc...&amp;constantly preach that you’re 100%correct about everything, naive people will be scared into believing you too.🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Still pushing for those ignorant young votes 😂. He is literally an old grandad trying to fit in with the youngsters. CorBIN is nothing but a bygone hippy with gingerbread house policies luring in the kiddies votes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Channel4News Brexit is a mess simply because remainers spreading their end of the world doom &amp; gloom. They’re causing the uncertainty which is putting the UK in such a predicament in the first place. You cant preach with one hand brexit is bad while causing all it’s problems with the other...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerrettLorraine @Channel4News What’s the truth?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@talkRADIO @JuliaHB1 Absolutely not!. It will only lead to people dumping rubbish in the streets, allies, country lanes &amp; fields etc... we generate more rubbish per household than ever before &amp; its rising... a monthly bin collection is a stupid idea.  https://t.co/zbBtoCAdtB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB Yikes. I’m still waiting for her to accept a single illegal immigrant into her fancy mansion to live with her &amp; her kids😂. fucking virtue signalling hypocrite😂 😂 why should anyone value the opinion of some bygone singer 🤨🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elonmusk Honestly makes me so fucking happy &amp; excited seeing this... get me off this place already😩😆.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So wholesome 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😲😯😳👍🏼👌🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Michael_Heaver @Nigel_Farage I’m just going to say what they would say to us if we lost. Get over it, it’s done. That is how democracy works. learn to accept it and adapt to the new status quo. crying &amp; labelling everyone who has a different opinion to you as Nazis or racists etc... doesn’t help anyone...🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking We are leaving the EU, so doesn’t matter what they think anymore... we control ourself. So can surveillance how we please. But I guarantee the EU has more dodgy things going on itself, so they can’t talk. they want to censor the internet... that’s more of a breach of human rights<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lewisblissett1 Actually good. Will be a shame once his balls drop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IainDale I’m glad someone with a voice called him what he is... though I’d have used a few more ‘colourful’ words along side treasonous 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB Lol no, the summer cast that filled in for piers was cancerous enough. if he goes then so goes the viewership. A majority of people watch @GMB to see @piersmorgan rip people apart 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC We cant say a single thing against Islamic extremists, Muslim child rape gangs or even Muslims in general with out it being called islamophobic or extreme hate speech etc...😴 but anjem will be free once more to spread his real hatred &amp; brainwash for another bombing no doubt. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ridderz69 @LBC But the rape gangs are real... it’s been all over the news by many other sources... so what Tommy says doesn’t have to be believed if it’s actually true🤔😂.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neiltaylor16 @LBC Remove his head. Place it on a spike at the Tower of London.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CostlyWrath @LBC @Nigel_Farage Lmao, give it a rest 😴. Nigel wasnt the one brainwashing Muslims into blowing themselves up in London in the 7/7 bombings. Bet your someone who would shake anjem’s hand in the street &amp; thank him for his work 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon @gaytimesmag The reason they have such poor mental health is because of this JSW PC society being created, that is twisting their minds into thinking their gender is something other than Male or female. &amp;you chucked them all into a group, gave them a letter each &amp;a flag. Hows that supportive?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB Absolutely fucking not. She clearly thinks she is superior to everyone else. her entitled spoilt bitch attitude was disgraceful and she tried to justify it by hiding behind sexism, feminism &amp; equality😂... wouldn’t be surprised if that MALE umpire loses everything now... 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GerardBattenMEP So much for saving the planet. well over half of that stuff will be wasted,thrown out, burnt and dumped. So unnecessary... it’s pathetic to be honest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theresa_may Get in touch with someone who has a backbone to stand up for our country&amp; deliver the brexit we voted for and someone who is capable to dealing with terrorism &amp; our huge rise in knife &amp; gun crime. Your little ‘banter’ tweet is nothing but a cringe attempt to relate to the public.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Osman_Janjua @toonut68 @GMB @GeoffreyBoycott Dont forget, the reason brexit is in such a mess in the first place is because remainers are running it &amp; brought the shadow of uncertainty upon us. literally all the problems with brexit come from remainers. you really cant moan its leaves fault when its remains actions🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haha well said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GGXupdates Who is this guy? Can anyone tell me?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KTHopkins She’s just mugged herself off. She should have said ‘yes, you’re right, it’s not healthy or sensible to promote&amp; encourage my morbid obesity’. Then go off &amp; be a role model for obese people by transforming herself with weight loss to show it’s possible &amp;to promote being healthy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC It’s not the little girl talking, it’s the parents using her for publicity &amp; to make people feel sympathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SerWinterGaming Meh...I’m not sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually makes me watch tv for once... albeit on iPlayer, so maybe it doesn’t count 🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wroetoshaw Damn!, the air lost that fight for sure! no way it could withstand those power punches without being K.O.ed😯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @MaajidNawaz It’s dangerous for everyone! there is no cameras in changing rooms... sexual assault would be easier to commit &amp; so would false MeToo allegations. There is only 2 genders btw. Why mix them for the sake of a minority with a mental health issue that think their gender is a unicorn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel so lost &amp; empty in life. I need some kind of fucking direction or something. but I don’t know what I want. Nothing interests me🤷🏻‍♂️😩😔. Not depressed just lost &amp; empty, it’s weird.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @AndrewCastle63 Try paying the guards a better wage, then they won’t have to result to getting paid for sneaking in shit. also dealing with the Muslim conversion extremist prison gangs would be a good place to start!<|endoftext|>

Same goes for the ignorant ‘greek&amp;T1 best buddie duo’ fanboys who think there is still a friendship, Tyler cut that shit off long ago, accept it.

<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking never heard of this guy until this news he wants to resign. If he wants to resign, so what??. he is disgusted by the labours vile antisemitism, can’t blame him for wanting to resign but now labour is dictating &amp;threatening him to stay... he should just say fuck you &amp; walk away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dapperlaughs Not seen anyone side with her so safe to say she’s chatting shit&amp; its not true... shame, she did it on tv to public so the SJWs are going to love this &amp; make sure his career is ruined no matter what, even if it’s false... nowadays once accused, always guilty, no evidence needed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Get us a trade deal while you’re out there mate. 👍🏼👌🏼<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RitaPanahi Promoting obesity as a normal life choice (same with anorexic) is stupid... yeah, some obese women can look sexy but its no excuse to promote it as normal &amp; healthy. we are being forced to accept it because obese people are too lazy to lose the weight. priorities are all wrong.🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Literally got a worse social life than a prisoner in solitary confinement...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC You cant. once you’re accused, you’re always guilty. that’s the way it is nowadays. Ain’t nobody innocent until proven guilty anymore... it’s like the ‘in thing’, the trendy thing to do, to carelessly accuse people with no evidence and have it believed as true without question.😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GerardBattenMEP 2018: call us he, she or ‘they!’...  2032: holographic technology is advanced enough to give ever person a real-life over-head holographic name tag...just like the gamer-tags in computer games, we now have customisable ‘life tags’.

<|startoftext|>@GerardBattenMEP Did you know there is only 2 genders? &amp; you are either one or the other?... you can transition between the two but you’re still one or the other.

<|startoftext|>@StephenDixonTV @JuliaHB1 No wonder we all have depression , anxiety, low self esteem, crippling self consciousness,  increasingly unstable mental health as a whole &amp;a weird 72 genders mental disorder&amp; its all being normalised. society has become a disease on mental health.

<|startoftext|>@KTHopkins The few whites ain’t even British either, they are Romanian &amp; polish 😂😂😂 yikes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Leah_thais @LBC @FlashMob4EU @MatthewStadlen Of course you would. You got the EU flag plastered all over your Twitter &amp; that cringe # in your name😂😂 can you get any more biased? I dread to think what one-sided political manipulation crap you’re feeding your vulnerable unwise students. Borderline brainwashing I’d imagine😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @MatthewStadlen Mate, they don’t even know who you are... let alone what the houses Parliament even is... they just call it Big Ben. Trust me, politics is the last thing on 16-17s minds &amp; that is the reason you want them to have a say, because they ain’t got a clue so it’s easy manipulation...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GMB This is the reason we are increasingly reliant on foreigners to do our jobs for us 😂. we don’t want to put the work in... we are becoming so lazy &amp; entitled.

<|startoftext|>@JagexShogun @RuneScape @Zephusees Armour symmetry is important tbh, at least for me. The abyssal knights armour override is a good example of armour not looking right without having proper symmetry, the shoulders plates don’t line up together &amp; the one armoured arm is annoying. Maybe it’s just my OCD 🤷🏻‍♂️😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JagexShogun @RuneScape @Zephusees Honestly, someone’s simplistic looks a lot better than exotic flashy armour. I like the middle the most tbh but it’s close with all 3. I also love symmetry, I can’t stand one shoulder armours, they’re not been dont right on this game, yet🤷🏻‍♂️ who knows.<|endoftext|>

You cant joke with feminists😂, they will now take this as an endorsement &amp; will kick off &amp; demand a female bond🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC BAD deal, the clue is in the name. anyone thinking that is even an viable option is delusional!. It’s like shooting yourself in the head to cure a headache... it’s just stupid to even think of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking How is it legal for @SadiqKhan to still be in office? London is infested with violence, citizens LITERALLY die on the streets daily thanks to his incapability. Disgraceful little weasel! If someone can’t do their job they get fired. He has blood on his hands &amp; still isn’t fired!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB If not idris, I say tom hardy but I fear fucking poldark will get it but he is too scrony &amp; doesn’t fit my expectations of bond. So tom hardy it is!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeW6ootton @dan_boxing_fan @GMB Doctor who was always supposed to be Male but look whats happened. They made all female ghostbusters &amp; oceans 8...a female bond will be the icing on the cake for feminist political correctness SJWs to make a statement by ruining another franchise with a flopped feminist version😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB I don’t see his skin colour I see s good actor, he’d make a good bond but I honestly hope he turnt it down in defiance to only being offered the part because of his skin colour, thanks to the toxic political correctness &amp; SJW cancer ruining everything it touches.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB Why can’t Jeremy scream at the idiots on this show like he does on his own...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB Fuck the’ #MeToo era’, the SJWs and ‘political correctness’... they’re all cancerous plagues on society. stop giving in to these minorities of attention seeking nonces, only out to fuel their own ego to feel important ruining peoples lives &amp; selfishly getting other women fired.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC All he cares about is losing all his polish &amp; Romanian cheap labour plumbers😂. he is on a good little screw, he doesn’t want to have to hire British plumbers &amp; pay out proper wages for once🙄. He just wants slave labour and to cut corners because of greed, pretty scummy tbh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn Wow holy shit, you look as haggled &amp; frail as theresa May😬. Time for you both to step down and find a nice retirement home together. You can both live in either side of it with dementia and fight as if you was still in Parliament 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JagexShauny Shauny about to hit lvl 99 baby making! Haha👶🏻🙌🏻👍🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beverleyturner @LBC Humans in general are becoming lazy. Kids dont go out or even play on the garden anymore. Technology like iphones, Xbox etc have taken over kids lives, yeah it’s the parents fault for giving them an the devices but it’s society’s fault as a whole to pressuring us to ‘fit in’.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn A majority of people never even knew who he was let alone what he did 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Lol, like anyone knew who he was anyway.🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theresa_may @ImranKhanPTI Wtf is Pakistan going to keep secure for us 😂. Don’t forget the Pakistani child rape gangs here in UK. Do we get a special deal for that too? the gangs are running low on members. But You’re weak &amp; spineless enough to accept something stupid like that if it was offered.😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @TomSwarbrick1 Not aggressive yet, but people are increasingly fed up &amp; angry with the weak ignorant government turning a blind eye to problems like rape gangs &amp; lose of our culture for another. we don’t want to live behind diversity barriers in our own country for the sake of multiculturalism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB Why is this even a debate😂. People dont have to live next to each other&amp; play happy little neighborhood. this isnt America where neighbours bring each other freshly baked pies with excessive grins😀most neighbors in the UK despise one another but act like friends face to face.😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn You really don’t like diversity do you?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TashaTBHx My best friend did exactly the same to me. And I still don’t know why to this day way. 🤷🏻‍♂️ 😕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC It’s disrespectful to the Jews of the 1930s. she disgraces their resilience to survive &amp; fight on, simply because she can’t cope being told off &amp; investigated for her behaviour, so she want to pull the ‘feel sorry for me, I’m a Jew by the way’ card.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @NickFerrariLBC that guy who couldn’t back himself back up was completely wrong &amp; an outright idiot tbh. “Tommy hates all Muslims”... yet it is very easy to find various evidence of Tommy saying the opposite of everything that guy said. Stop playing the imaginary race card😂😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RuneScape Honestly, the wildy is literally and metaphorically dead. It’s a HUGE part off the map wasted. I’d like it repurposed/ reclaimed, but warbands, cursed energy &amp; a few minor things kinda stop it being possible. Wouldnt want them to fall into another gamers grotto style hub either❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Might as well have said, ‘terror attacks are part of society now so just go about your day, but if you get caught up in one then its your fault for not looking out hard enough’. It’s a disgrace that us Brits have to live behind diversity barriers in our own nation for protection!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GMB @adilray @piersmorgan I pray to god piers comes back early. Today’s show was plugged full of racist remarks... and the shouting... wtf was that about!

<|startoftext|>@GMB Yes it is fine. But the government would rather us live in fear of it... or in prison if anyone dares to mock or defy it...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GMB @adilray @ranvir01 @SeanFletcherTV @Lauratobin1 @RichardAArnold Richards reaction to the smell of the tea 😂it was also my reaction when I realised this show goes out of its way on pointing out the presenters skin colour, ethnicity&amp;foreign traditions while mocking British traditions &amp;culture with no back lash. imagine if the table was turned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @NickFerrariLBC No... there is no ‘issue’! It’s the media &amp; the weak PM dragging it out to try and find a way to crucify him. 😂 just accept the majority agree and a bigger majority think heavier than Boris... going to punish the majority of the UK too? Twats, give it a rest.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC There is no “Islamophobia”. &amp; the only things ‘fanning the flames’ are terrorist attacks, Muslim child rape gangs, Muslims unwillingness to integrate &amp;adapt to British culture. Why should we lose our culture for the sake of a foreign one?&amp; to question is to be ‘racist’. Pathetic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet Just tell me now.  https://t.co/9HHaZRkZys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @MatthewStadlen as long as they dont go out their way in the films to point out he is black to make a PC statement, then i see no problem. i also dont want them to end up appeasing the PC brigade by making him transgender or gay or turn him into a female etc... or make him religous in ANY way...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @MatthewStadlen yes, he is a good actor &amp; will fit the cheesy cheeky role well, imo.  and in no way am i saying i want him for his skin colour! I see a good actor only. anyone celebrating simply for the fact he is black, then you're pathetic... the PC, SJW crap needs to stop.  https://t.co/KEjeZZQfHW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC it was also clear she was reading of a prewritten script... most likely by her father next to her. she is also 9 years old...she has little to no understanding of the argument at hand. so her opinion on the matter is meaningless...she didnt exactly ring LBC herself now did she...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC tell a child fairies exist &amp; they'll believe it. tell a child to wear a hijab otherwise, they'll burn in hellfire... they will believe it also. kids minds are like sponges, they believe what they are told. its not her decision, it the parents decision coming from the girls mouth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @MatthewStadlen NO. a majority agree with Boris, so you're going to have to punish the majority who agree!. it isnt islamophobic when it has nothing to do with islam. its a cultural thing from the middle east, it is NOT British culture!. we'd be hung for imposing our culture in Saudi Arabia!...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC @NickFerrariLBC Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC It’s sad we’re expected to live in fear&amp;silence to not criticise anything remotely linked to Muslims or Islam. But our national religion(Christianity)can be freely mocked, criticised &amp;disrespected. I dont care for any religion. Why must we bow down &amp; cower from criticising Islam?  https://t.co/3gwpjOqNIE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Agreed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking This Borris stuff is way out of hand, it’s pathetic. Just accept it!, the majority of the public agree with him and even call the burka worse names &amp; actually want it banned... so you investigating half the nation too?, didnt think so!. Huge mistake for torys if he is expelled.  https://t.co/psBfsanUzL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @mrjamesob James is so arrogant. I wouldn’t be surprised if he gave himself a semi &amp;had a little voice in his head telling him how great &amp; right he is about everything, every time he spoke. 😂  https://t.co/fwrzh5gjdS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Well Duh. Arrest him for that and you have to arrest half the UK... people are saying a lot worse things than him, so you’re lucky he didn’t quote anything from the public.😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Oh well?... that’s what happens when people who can’t sail boats try cross the sea illegally in a rubber dinghy that only fits 3 people but it’s filled with 30. This isnt news. besides, I wouldn’t be surprised if they capsized on purpose so they can’t go back &amp; we have sympathy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Why don’t you just poison them back?😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @NickFerrariLBC A lot more kids will be home schooled once parents realise they’re kids will soon start to be brainwashed &amp; confused as to their gender&amp; crap like that!. Home schooling is fine, it’s not as if kids go out &amp; socialise nowadays anyway, its all done on xbox so what’s the difference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidkurten @UKIP I’d go fucking mental!, if I found out they were brainwashing &amp; confusing my young, unwise, impressionable, vulnerable child!. I don’t even have a kid but I’m still fuming knowing it’s happening, I fear for the future if this crap is ‘normalised’.  https://t.co/wyyWsmmtHQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB Waa waa waa!😭 the bad words hurt my feelings... again!😂 offensive this, offensive that... Ughh, stop being so sensitive!😴. Don’t want your kid swearing?, raise them properly&amp; teach them to respect🙄. Comes down to personal preference. Besides, swearing helps relieve stress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC I can pretty much guarantee she won’t be targeted by Tommy supporters. she is a former aide who helped Tommy so why’d they attack her? They wouldn’t recognise her if she walked down the street anyway. She never made a fuss when she was beat up by Male leftist masked thugs...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GMB Fat ‘shaming’ wont help anyone, it will  only lead to depression, insecurity, anxiety, suicide etc... things we could do without. But we can’t keep going on like being fat is fine, just to avoid hurting peoples feelings. Also gym routines &amp; healthy food is never taught in schools<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WestmonsterUK If something is bad &amp; illegal, it’s the polices fucking job to stop/fix it! Race,skin &amp; religion is IRRELEVANT!!. “Don’t want to rock the cultural boat”...but it’s exactly what they are doing in the first place!... freely committing crimes that go against British culture &amp; values<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WestmonsterUK Almost more cranes in London than buildings, it’s crazy😂... but ay, we cant forget when the remainers ‘dooms day’ gets here, they will all burn in the hell fire anyway🤷🏻‍♂️😂  https://t.co/udTwaB86pl<|endoftext|>

I just don’t understand...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TuffsLiam Its ‘racist’ for exposing Muslim rape gangs&amp;said we“ignore the white rapists”. But theyre not ignored, they’re dealt with at the click of a finger. Its Muslim rape gangs who are protected&amp;hidden. rape is rape, no matter your skin/religion! Not our fault theyre majority Muslims!😑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB With technology nowadays you don’t even need to know the language, it’s a waste money teaching it, you can put together entire conversations through google translate or other language apps on smartphones. World leaders do just fine without knowing other languages... 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB A waste of cash. We have more important &amp;essential life skills that need to be taught to kids, things like first aid &amp;how to manage taxes, bills, mortgages, debt, loans, money management etc...essential thing that always seem to be ignored&amp; religious studies need be scrapped too.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SnowflakeHunte2 @lbcbreaking They are retrialing him at leeds court again too...🙄, frankly, they haven’t got a leg to stand on, in my opinion. the defendants from the trial Tommy reported on filed for a  disqualification of the trial for Tommy’s actions. it was denied, so clearly no contempt was committed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@davidkurten It’s the latest 21st century invasion tactic &amp; its incredibly effective &amp; because it’s not an out right military invasion, we can’t see it as an invasion, we just blindly allow it.

<|startoftext|>@RussInCheshire @mrjamesob @BBCNews The word “racist” is so freely thrown around these days it’s become so meaningless &amp; petty. &amp; just because one of them (Bannon, a foreigner btw) said fuck it &amp; embraced the brand of racist, doesn’t make the others racist, or agree with him😂. the ‘other 3’ want to protect the UK.<|endoftext|>

Strange🤔😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB Yes, majority of brits are lazy. they take their privilege for granted, hence why we rely on foreigners to do our dirty work because we think we are above fields picking etc... &amp;the main problem is junk food is cheap &amp; brought in bulk &amp; healthy food is too expensive to be viable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon *sniff* *sniff* why do I smell bullshit... yet again😂 I have no respect for you,youve completely ruined my capital!

<|startoftext|>@LBC This tweet is hilarious!😂poor little labour being criticised about their anti semitism, how ever will they cope!. they have to be anti Semitic to appease a certain group for votes 😂 &amp; it’s not like labour constantly tweets to attack &amp; take advantage of the tories fuck ups🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KTHopkins It’s like that lingering feeling you get when you know you’re going to be sick but haven’t yet... but you always feel better after.

<|startoftext|>@KTHopkins Ughh, I really can’t be bothered with a civil war or revolution etc... it’s so inconvenient. I just want to Netflix &amp; chill😂, but the government is ignorantly forcing Britain into unrest more &amp; more, it’s only a matter of time until it snaps...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC @ShelaghFogarty we are too politically correct &amp; weak-minded to deal with anything now, its pathetic!. &amp; its rubbing off on our kids, they are taught to be weak, overly emotional &amp; self-conscious, not to mention the confusion of sexuality forced on them so young, its extremely damaging mentally!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @ShelaghFogarty ay, if you're worried about them becoming a martyr, don't. all you need to do is show them the executioner is female, its their biggest fear, they can not get their 72 virgins if killed by a woman... its the biggest insult to their 'meaningful death' and they will go to hell😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @ShelaghFogarty Stop calling them Britons or nicknaming them 'the Beatles' simply because of their accents, its insulting to the actual Beatles. they are NOT British in any way shape or form! they lost their 'British &amp; human rights the moment they decided to fight for that vile hateful ideology!  https://t.co/wZZcikJMse<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC 6years OmegaLUL!. Our justice system is FUCKED.

<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage #FarageOnLBC I’m 24, &amp; I strongly support the return of capital punishment. not because of ‘islamophobia’ but as a punishment &amp; deterrent to crime in general, our punishment is weak. And the ‘Beatles’ lost their human rights the moment they inhumanly slaughtered!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @ShelaghFogarty Yes!. We should be 100% fine with it. Why should they be allowed to behead and slaughter people and get a slap on the wrist? They lost their human rights the moment they denied the rights of innocent people by slaughtering them!. We need capital punishment reinstated here in UK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidkurten Disgusting. This should be a crime. Kids shouldnt be confused like this &amp; subject to literal brainwashing!. This is a reason why gays, trans etc... are still struggling to be accepted. LGBT have to stop this constant force feeding of acceptance &amp; now forced ‘conversion’, its sick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC We ain’t copying America with the death penalty. We just want it REINSTATED, we had capital punishment LONG before the USA even existed. We need it reinstated because there is no fear or repercussions when committing (serious) crimes, capital punishment is a good deterrent.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jon_the_d @ThePledge @MaajidNawaz Wish people stopped referring everything they disagree with as something to do with Hitler or being a Nazi 😂 it’s been 70+ years... the reference is irrelevant😅.

<|startoftext|>@ThePledge @MaajidNawaz I hate the ‘designer baby’ idea... designing your kid is stupid, life isnt a video game where you can customise your character before you start the game. You get what you’re given. But completly eradicating some conditions, disease etc... is worth looking into for the future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidkurten The left working against brexit is the only reason it will turn out bad...they’re just cutting off their nose to spite their face whilst simultaneously shooting their self in the foot.

<|startoftext|>@davidkurten 1st is was walk away, then it was no deal, then was hard brexit &amp;now it’s ‘crashing out’...🙄how overly dramatic😂. dread to think how the entire rest of the world copes outside the tiny EU dictatorship... must be hell out there😂.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidkurten Honestly don’t know how you keep calm with this childish little weasel’s smug remarks &amp; vile 12years old attitude😂. he may sound ‘professional’ with his ‘lawyer talk’ but he is totally incompetent &amp; has blood on his hands!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB Instead of worrying about the time they have off, worry about the failing education system!. Teach them about money,bills, taxes, debt, loans, mortgages, 1st aid etc... LIFE SKILLS to help prevent kids getting into debt etc. &amp; Get rid of religious studies &amp; language classes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC I don’t care for football but this is a extremely disrespectful act. she sounds Australian so is clearly a foreigner, so explains the clear lack of respect for British culture&amp; tradition. They should be fined.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @NickFerrariLBC You cant just erase history because you disagree with it&amp; the world now works differently!. It still happened no matter how much you erase,so just accept &amp;Learn from it. Just shows how pathetic the left is, no respect for anything. But If it was the ‘right’ there’d be OUTRAGE!🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaheemKassam @ggatehouse @BBCNewsnight Release it! I’d love to hear it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMaximeWest you dont actually have to watch it...you can freely change the channel at any time, but you crave to be self-triggered. you saying they know nothing about the judicial system isnt factual either&amp;guarantee you know no details of the case.   we voted to leave, get the fuck over it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@67Snowy ah, the left... such beautiful language. and always full of so much self-hatred... such extremist views too, yikes. always looking for an opportunity to impose 'forcible suppression of opposition', a main trait of a true fascist! so go a reevaluate yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradleyWaters16 @AaronBastani you're right. comparing a citizen who is very concerned about young British female children being raped by muslim rape gangs and then ignored by the state, to a murderer and a terrorist is completely disrespectful to the concerned citizen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LookingThroughY @AaronBastani what is far right about calling out muslim child rape gangs??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcusStead tommy was obedient and respectful of the court the whole time he was there, he never even stepped on the courts land &amp; even asked the police if he was okey to carry on. no contempt was caused.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcusStead 1. Its 1 case split into 3 parts/smaller cases. 2.The part he reported on was the guilty sentencing of that part. 3.information shared was already publicly available on the BBC website. 4.He never out right said they did the crime, they were all alleged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Otto_English Lmao don’t be so ignorant. it’s very clear they was booing the fact the Pakistani child rape gang members are predominantly followers of Islam and not because it was @GerardBattenMEP who said it 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreitbartLondon the little rats think they can make themselves look good by bringing the case forwards after a delay but in truth, they've not really brought it forward if they are going to withhold the decision for another 2 weeks+<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GerardBattenMEP seems to me like a last-ditch effort to brand UKIP &amp; Tommy as racists. they know UKIP &amp;tommy support is growing &amp; they are scared, so they will be laying out the traps to discredit at all cost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TfL @CorryShawComedy @MayorofLondon meh... that ain't happening. everyone on London transport is either foreign &amp; doesn't speak English or is just a moody bastard and never smiles 😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage @theresa_may HAHA! Theresa's face LMAO! if only looks could kill 😂😂😂😂😂  https://t.co/n3Wg0qJUyT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ezralevant if it was denied, then there was clearly no contempt of court and Tommy has been wrongly imprisoned... case closed. Tommy should be released immediately and compensated for his mistreatment &amp; false imprisonment by the state.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC The conservative are crumbling thanks to their ignorance &amp;inability to act to save themselves...I despise labour but I am 80% sure they will win the next election, even if torys save themselves...too little too late. although, I dont see corbyn as leader. Labour has problems too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 I like all these people acting like they’ve never misspoke before &amp; not realised😂. Lets stop the witch hunt&amp;accept he actually won a democratic election,no matter how much you hate him. When has a leader is ever 100%loved anyway? No one can do everything you demand.

<|startoftext|>@OzraeliAvi Taking place in sadiq khans Londonistan too... that weasel has full control of Tommy, he will go out his way to silence Tommy&amp;no one can do or say anything about it!

<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking That damn brexit, ruining the economy &amp; our jobs again! Curse you! 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Any chance to delegitimise brexit. just accept it, You will feel so much healthier. Funny how the rise of the so called ‘right’ (e.g. trump &amp; brexit etc) is constantly attacked as being, cheaters or hacked their way to popularity. If the left won they’d call it fair &amp;legitimate😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 When the government is on the brink of Collapse &amp; the nation is in crisis with civil unrest &amp; the government ignores democracy&amp; doesnt honour the brexit that was voted for, then the government should be legally obliged to suspend holidays until a national crisis is felt with!🤔🙄  https://t.co/LrcIaPiwob<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 The government crumbling, white paper treachery, civil unrest, democracy ignored, incompetent prime minister...you’d expect them to be putting in over time to stop the UK collapsing in on itself but no, they aint payed enough &amp; need a holiday for their hard work, bless them🙄🤔😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Fucking lazy beggars. DO YOUR JOBS &amp;SORT THIS FUCKING MESS OUT!. if a house is on fire you dont leave it to go on holiday!. the white paper treason isnt just another day in Parliament, this situation is bigger than your fucking holiday so you better work over time to fix it!😡🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrenchFutbol 😂 Glad England didn’t win then, we’d of ended up in the same state, especially with the stuff we got going on in the UK atm... riots over football would’ve been the last thing we needed😂. Then again we probably ain’t far off having riots anyway with the state of things🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theresa_may @FIAFarnborough @astro_timpeake One of the worlds most weak countries, where we... well YOU also nurture the next generation of Islamic Pakistani child rape gangs, because you protect them &amp; lock us up for wanting it dealt with!. Just resign! You’re making the UK very vulnerable in a number of harmful ways😡🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@shyelghazi @Jamal_R1 @LBC Who is an extreme racist?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking If we dont deal with mrs May &amp; her shameful brexit plan then we risk sinister&amp; sly people or nations taking advantage of our weakened state. &amp;could lead to big problems like, the breakup of UK, riots, a civil war or in an EXTREMELY rare chance, an vasion by someone like Russia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @clivebull might as well... our government is incapable!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @TomSwarbrick1 Even remainers are disgusted with her white paper... so she is doing something VERY VERY wrong!...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KTHopkins @TwitterSupport Wow fuck that!, That is literally ear cancer!. In a country where its normal routine to be shackled into prayer 4 times a day, you’d think they’d remember to go to prayer &amp; wouldn’t have to screech out of a tower at each other to tell them. REEE 😂  https://t.co/yQfZhrCzUP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Correct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SadiqKhan @metpoliceuk You sent out a section 12 to everyone at the protests so you could slyly suppress free speech&amp; because you personally hate trump &amp;would love Tommy dead, youre a pathetic childish scummy weasel!.You’d even STRONGLY condemn them without violence but terror attacks are parr&amp;parcel🤔  https://t.co/BIhDR1HnUN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @MatthewStadlen No more grid girls, dart girls &amp; even beauty in Zbeauty contests...&amp; now no more female fans allowed to be seen at football because they are sexualised by the left for being ‘hot’ &amp; is being banned👏🏻 who decides who is hot?... everybody has different preferences. 🤦🏻‍♂️ Ughh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage With the countless young British girls gang raped all over Britain by ‘asian’ immigrants, the photoshopped version is not too far off the mark of how these rape gangs think. &amp; so what if Nigel made a mistake &amp; retweeted a fake photo... no one is perfect🤦🏻‍♂️ #Meme 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimMFelton @mrjamesob @Nigel_Farage Not everyone knows a photoshop at a glance... Nigel fell for it(even I did for a moment). No one is perfect or gets everything right😂. But some refugees do only see the photoshop as the correct one, hence the huge amount of young girls raped be ‘Asian’ immigrant gangs in the UK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rigante1 @lbcbreaking 250k people in a city of 10million, in a country of 55million, in a United Kingdom of 66million, on a continent of 740million, on a planet of 7.6 billion... 😂 pretty futile, especially when trump literally doesn’t give a shit🤣. If he is so hated he’d never have got in office😴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Shut this Wallis &amp; Gromit looking arse up!. Bygone politicians need to stop popping back up only when something is going on. no one wants to hear what you got to say, especially when you didn’t achieve anything significant in Parliament 😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Well duhhhh... no one is not going to want to trade with us... we are HUGE consumers, 65 million citizens &amp; 5th largest economy in the world... people ain’t just going to ignore that 😂  https://t.co/aXErkGkXav<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @MaajidNawaz Pathetic. Why give this nonsense the time of day. dinosaurs offend me, can we ban them too?... god forbid we ever invent time travel... the extreme left will go back in time to PC cleanse history but are so stupid to realise they’d delete themselves from history in the process😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Ok, it made me giggle because it was so unexpected &amp;unique 😂. But I think the UK has shown trump too much for one day of how childish &amp; pathetic a few of us can be. Its only embarrassing for the UK to do this stuff... lets grow up a bit now. Im surprised you didnt get shot down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Penny75637189 @lbcbreaking But we need to fight ‘hate’ with petty childish hate...😆😂🤣 we must show this hatter we hate him 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthewchampion @mrjamesob He also went for a shit at3:00pm but it was actually2:59pm😀. So what if he predicted it the day before, after or never,honestly doesnt matter. why are people so irate over such an insignificant prediction😂, I guess we HAVE to overreact &amp; get irate just because trump said it👏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidkurten Lol they think theyre fighting to protect the women but they are just suppressing &amp; censoring them. women can celebrate football too without being sexualised &amp; censored because they are ‘hot’. Being ‘hot’ isnt a specific type, anyone can be ‘hot’ according to your preference!🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Holbornlolz Anyone who says he has sciatica is as drunk as junker himself!. &amp;this unelected dictator wants more control over EU nations &amp;their armies.

Far-right threats = people who point out this embarrassment for the UK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brianklaas @JuliaHB1 😂 what a humiliating embarrassment for the UK. You think trump cares about this petty balloon Hahahahaha!. It will achieve nothing but national embarrassment for the UK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC He may have become mayor solely on his skin colour &amp; religion, but that does NOT make him untouchable!... he IS doing an INCREDIBLY BAD job &amp; he needs to be held to account!.

<|startoftext|>@LBC @NickFerrariLBC Just leave already! We got remainers running the show so no wonder we cant get a real brexit!

<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Not foolish... it just HAS to happen, for the sake of brexit, continuation of the conservatives being in power and to stop the country going stagnant because she gets nothing done.

Time we stood up to them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Thats obvious,even a 2 year old could see that🙄.she should’ve been delivering the brexit that was voted for in the democratic referendum.

<|startoftext|>@LBC @beverleyturner Majority of footballers are straight, SO WHAT!...some people are gay, good for them... doesnt mean EVERYTHING has to be gayafied to suit the small minority over the larger.

<|startoftext|>@LBC A no deal has always been the only brexit deal!.

<|startoftext|>@GMB Just stop already 😩😫 stop giving his ridiculous crap a platform!😡.

<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Cobra doesnt archive much, Other than making ignorant citizens think the government is in control because they held a meeting with a fancy name, when in reality all it is, is a tea party with all the important mates.

<|startoftext|>@LBC @iancollinsuk Suppressing more of peoples rights... people should be allowed to choose to try if they want it or not... same with the banning of skirts in schools... 1st free speech is being suppressed, now freedom of Choice 😂 this is pathetic.

<|startoftext|>@Michael_Heaver @realDonaldTrump @Nigel_Farage Nigel is literally the strongest political link &amp; closest British ‘politician’ to the president for the UK. if they are stopped from meeting, then the UK government is only kicking the stool out from under their feet with a noose round their neck...very foolish &amp; selfish move🙄😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FreshGman @kruttika108 @UKLabour Brexit is straight forward, the only reason it isn’t done already is because weak remainers are running negotiations &amp; the EU is taking advantage of that &amp; remainers can’t accept democracy.

<|startoftext|>@LBC Where is the geeza? who cares! he gave the people what they wanted...a vote. Time to get on with it, stop crying&amp; deliver us Brexit in full, all out, no strings.

<|startoftext|>@LBC Go on mogg!

<|startoftext|>@SadiqKhan @metpoliceuk Biggest rise in sabbing&amp;gun crime in London thanks to you!. 50+deaths&amp; rising daily,on your watch!

<|startoftext|>@RaheemKassam @SadiqKhan @mrjamesob Its concerning that I can not find the full video of the event. even the video of the Tommy supporters being kicked out wasnt even top of the search, it was covered by 5 year old videos.

That is the way forward in such an increasingly cramped city like London.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @NickFerrariLBC This gender argument is so petty&amp; primitive, I thought we were an intelligent race,guess not.

<|startoftext|>@GMB The Harvey Weinstein drama started WELL OVER a year ago&amp;its attention is died down.

<|startoftext|>@SadiqKhan I’m not being funny, I understand you’re Muslim,but why do you go out your way to attend Muslim events&amp; are always so heartbroken, yet you ignore non-Muslim victims of terror attacks? their deaths are part&amp; parcel, right? what happened to the multicultural London you boast about?  https://t.co/41GInLGyYT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 The only people at this march are the sore losers who can’t accept they lost &amp; didn’t get their way in a DEMOCRATIC referendum.

<|startoftext|>@davidkurten Convenient how @SadiqKhan is labour, the protesters were far-left labour fanatics&amp; labour won the elections but the undemocratic, unfair, vicious, vile &amp;quite frankly ILLEGAL tactics used makes it VOID.

<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking “Nothing to see here peasants, along you go”.

<|startoftext|>@LBC So did he have a bomb or what? I’m assuming he did because I’ve heard nothing about it. another cover up in the works? To keep us blind &amp; ignorant to the truth?

<|startoftext|>@RDGAMING84 @GMB Should be a zero-tolerance policy for any and all terror attacks or threats. shoot on sight, even if it turns out to be fake... a message needs to be sent that attacks &amp; threats are not tolerated at all and will be dealt with immediately with force.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@robdowde @SadiqKhan People are killed daily in London... no one even remembers the victims names already or will even mourn each one every year.

<|startoftext|>@LBC @clivebull A NO DEAL IS THE BEST&amp;ONLY DEAL. it’s not a ‘doomsday scenario’ at all.

<|startoftext|>@LBC They bring about the islamophobia upon themselves. islamophobia is a REACTON to their actions, their ignorance &amp; unwillingness to fix the problem the only way possible.... from within! 🤯🤷🏻‍♂️🤯  https://t.co/SKvt1GL2Ht<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC This ‘islamophobia’ attitude exists because Muslims lack of willingness to combat extremism &amp; hatred within their mosques &amp; communities themselves. the continuous terror attacks (by Muslims, following Islam’s commands)dont exactly help either or their reluctance to integrate.🙄😑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kaide_Walsh Why are the books put out on a pedestal🙄😬.

<|startoftext|>@LBC Honestly think it will cause more problems because they will feel suppressed... don’t you think it’s better to rap/sing about violence rather than actual carry it out?.

<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking I respect a lot him for his openness &amp; honesty of his views. Although personally he is against abortion even in rape, he doesnt impose his beliefs.

<|startoftext|>@LookBehindYou20 @GerardBattenMEP The only way we will be worse off is because of incessant moaning&amp;relentless attempts from remain to stop brexit, we are leaving no matter what. remain will only spit themselves&amp;hurt the UK by throwing a spanner in the works at every turn. Youre just shooting us all in the foot!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB not sure legalising heavy drugs will like heroine etc... will prevent addicts still relying on dealers.

<|startoftext|>@LBC @TomSwarbrick1 If you dont want to abort then fine... dont do it. But dont tell other women what they can&amp;cant do!.

<|startoftext|>@LBC @TomSwarbrick1 Their body, their choice. it isnt up to you!. No one but family&amp;the ‘father’ should have a say/opinion on it.

She’s not fit for office or capable of delivering what I voted for! LEAVE means LEAVE EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE EU! There will never be a ‘good deal’ so walk away!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Who?...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @MatthewStadlen We havent become ‘more racist’ at all. We are branded racist by very vocal Remain supporters. because we chose to leave the EU so we can govern &amp; control ourselves. they are just out to destroy brexit &amp; make it out to be a bad &amp; vile thing when it isn’t at all. Time to accept it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon @GMB You mean it was good to speak to people who won’t pressure you for answers &amp; let you skip around their questions. You’re the mayor of my capital yet you’re too scare &amp; weak to face @piersmorgan 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KTHopkins ...That isnt integration. it’s cleansing of a country that’s generous enough to let you stay their. So adapt &amp; integrate into that country’s ways or there isn’t a place for you their.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KTHopkins If youre a foreigner living in another country that has a different culture, society&amp; traditions to yours, I expect you to integrate into that. Not take over&amp; force your countrys culture etc in place of theirs. go back home if you have to bring your country to another country...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Well @SadiqKhan better start dusting them off. with the state london is in right now its only a matter of time till we will need them!😡or we could just use them to flush him out off office&amp; replace him with someone capable of ruining my capital city&amp;not run it into the ground!😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @SadiqKhan @GMB You know he will never face you piers... next time lie to him that you wont be on, then as his interview starts just pop up from under the desk! He can either unexpectedly face you or blatantly walk off, either way he will be humiliated &amp; make a fool of. It would be amazing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB @SadiqKhan Making ends meet is the real problem! Healthy food is far too expensive for struggling families to live off. buying frozen junk food is the only option they have. Banning posters of junk food will do NOTHING because the cheap junk food will still be there!🙄🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB @SadiqKhan NO NO NO! Its so simple, you said it yourself!“Those in deprived parts of london are more likely to be obese than those in WEALTHIER parts”. deprived people cant afford healthy food, it costs far too much! Its okey for wealthy people because ain’t struggling to make ends meet!🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet She expects us ‘peasants’ to do it all for her... lmao. Like we ain’t struggling to make ends meet ourselves as it is without feeding &amp; homing a foreign stranger...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB Want to stop obesity? Simple. raise the price of junk food&amp; lower the price of healthy food. the struggle to make ends meet is the real problem. frozen junk food can be brought in bulk for cheap &amp; lasts longer. struggling families need to save money wherever they can to survive.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lvl80bear @rafu007 @lbcbreaking ‘They will use that power to harass people’ haha. no,they’d use it to protect people. only someone who has something to hide would protest. a random search literally could mean life or death. better to find someone with a weapon before they kill rather than after, dont you think?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC Being naked is natural &amp; it’s no one business if you want to walk around your property naked! Maybe stop watching them being nosey neighbors then you wouldn’t create a problem for yourself... everyone hates being watched in their own homes...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JrseJ @LBC ‘His 1st protest’...how pathetic. He is far too young for that environment. &amp;you’re forcing your opinions&amp;views down his throat before he can even understand them or make his own mind up on the issues you protest against. your view is not his view.

<|startoftext|>@ashtonbirdie @PrisonPlanet Another irrelevant and pathetic thing people are making a huge fuss about, while real issues and problems in the world are being ignored or defended by them😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Its a no brainer!if it doesnt happen then the government is clearly against brexit&amp;the will of the people.Its time everyone got with the program&amp;accepted Brexit.Remainers need to realise we are leaving no matter what so they better help themselves by helping brexit,not defying it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GerardBattenMEP “I would love to debate you on that but I’m a leftist coward &amp;we cant debate an argument, especially on live TV...&amp;because we are on TV I cant brand you or twist your words because I have to be professional so I’ll do the only other thing leftists are good at&amp; that is censoring”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pestononsunday @UKIP @GerardBattenMEP “I would love to challenge you on that unfortunately thats all we got time for” such sad pathetic censorship because someone dares to have a particular opinion. but its what the left does... censors, brands, twist &amp; deflects any opposition &amp;never openly debates them. COWARDS 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @TomSwarbrick1 Haha everything always has to be a smear when it comes to comrade corbyn 😂🙄 приветствуем нашего брата с родины, jeremy corbyn 🤗😂😂😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RuneScape OSRS is supposed to be the inferior ‘vanilla’ spin-off of RS. RS3 is meant to be the MAIN game, it should have all the best ideas &amp; content etc... it should be OSRS taking content from RS3 not the other way round. There is RS3 content to finish/add yet before adding OS content.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhatTheFFacts I can say this right now... this is not a thing. I’ve NEVER seen this and I’m British 😂. But the idea makes so much sense! I’m actually surprised it isn’t a thing or at least used more if it is real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC He should be given a full state visit like every other nation. the US is our closest ally and we are letting the minority of vocal leftists ruin our nations relations with their personal hatred for trump. Like him or not he is the leader of our biggest ally so DEAL WITH IT 😴🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Trump has made more progress with with North Korea then anyone EVER. No matter how much you hate or love him, he deserves recognition and respect as an effective world leader.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Trump is doing a lot more good than harm to the world&amp;hater just cant admit they’re wrong to hate him. trump could denuclearise the world,stop world poverty,cure cancer but haters will still try to destroy him but the best ideas they got is to say he shagged a pornstar🤦🏻‍♂️😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MsBusterBoo @RealAlexJones Lol okey, let him carry on developing nukes &amp; continuing his families cruel dictatorship &amp; refuse his instrest in becoming more friendly &amp; open to the world. Arresting him would only show his people how right their propaganda is about Americans &amp; outsiders 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UberFacts Wow! I can’t wait! I’ll be sure to mark my calendar 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Providing nothing breaks down, this positive communication &amp; cooperation from North Korea will only benefit &amp; help the world towards a more peaceful and less uncertain future for all. Im pleased, a step in the right direction!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC @ShelaghFogarty Abusing them isn’t going to help anyone 😂 but it is a disgrace that doctors refused Alfie to go abroad for a treatment instead they condemn him to death in court... just like Charlie gard! Must not want to be seen as incompetent if foreign doctors have a breakthrough with him 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Long over due! We are leaving the EU so good relations with other nations is of huge importance! Just because you dont like trump does not mean we have to be petty &amp;ruin relations with the US over personal opinions of 1 man. THINK! Youre not helping anyone! Just hurting the UK🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GGXupdates Lego Star Wars is meant to be played with multiple characters! they do different things. Just because there is more than 1 character to use doesn’t mean your in co-op it means you need to stop greekP-ing because you can’t be bothered to put some effort in to understand the game😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB This is such an irrelevant&amp;pathetic thing. why ban them? it was the highlight of a party for me as a kid. don't ruin the kids fun! I'm pretty sure party bags are a rare thing nowadays anyway... and they are not a mandatory thing! its a goodie bag from a party for kids!...KIDS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GGXupdates If you want a retro star wars game you’re going to have to get a Nintendo 64 and try to screen cap it, the star wars game on that was the shit! 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👍🏼😍😍 and its *stone not rock LUL so I won’t be liking this GreekP post haha 🙃🙃🙃🙃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Fuck right off! Very bad idea! Just find the windrushers,get proof theyve lived here a while, be extremely tough to purge out immigrants trying to use this scandal to get free entry to the UK,make the windrusher British citizens with passports &amp; maybe some compensation. Done. 🤝<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if they’re refusing to send him to Italy purely in case Italian Drs have a breakthrough. Drs here are only trying to save themselves embarrassment from foreign Drs doing better than them! They did the same with Charlie gard!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB Wow wait a second! The Drs tried to kick Alfie into the grave for months, they won, but the dad still has to beg to take him home!? Disgusting. The kids survived for 3 days, no problems. TAKE HIM TO ITALY!What is there to lose if he is to die anyway? It’s foolish not to send him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB Look at the bloody state of him lmfao no tie, buttons undone, scruffy stubble... he is labour leader &amp; POTENTIAL future PM, what a mess. He is looking as rough as Theresa... time for them to both go&amp;a complete reshuffle of our government its a disgrace. I align with no party atm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @clivebull Its an attempt to buy votes just like telling us young voters we can have everything for free in the last election lmao. he knows people are very upset that St.Georges day was being branded racist so he see an opportunity. I want it as a holiday, just not by Corbyn’s insincerity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Belissalove If they don’t like it don’t follow/look... very simple. it’s a picture! it’s not going to defile your waiting for marriage virgin arse if you see it. Bet they scream when taking a shower because they have to touch their naked body 😂 it’s pathetic honestly 😂😂😂😂 #MoreNudesPlz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC What do you mean “is that enough” lol obviously it is... that’s what they got deported for so now they got them its sorted. Just watch out for frauds trying to claim they was deported so they can claim their free entry into the UK... Easy👏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB @julietdunlop Pathetic. I get that the boys incurable BUT...if Italian doctors may be able to help with a treatment at least try it before condemning him to death&amp;wasting time dragging this to court! How else will you find a cure or advance understanding! He could help cause a breakthrough!🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Stabbings ain’t news anymore... stabbings are as common in London as the black cabs, why ain’t they in the news? Stabbing are part of the daily life of living in London too now. “Part &amp; parcel”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet Lmao we can all just sit here don’t worry. our weak governments have everything under control I’m sure we can trust them to look after their own peoples 1st that is common sense after all. 🙃 they got this for sure 😬  https://t.co/l6cSSq4WmB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KTHopkins “my thoughts&amp;prayers are with them”is such a generic cringe saying its complete bullshit. Prayers cant save them now,should of prayed for it to never happen &amp; I guarantee no one is sat truly thinking of the victims other than the family&amp; friends. They’re forgotten like the rest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Greekgodx @REALIcePoseidon @MoistCr1TiKaL Yeah come on greks podcast. He has been looking for a way to be permanently banned on twitch so his GreekP brain doesn’t have to go into overload to try think up an excuse not to stream LuL 😂  https://t.co/ZTYHGle9rd<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AuntyBrexitFBPE @KTHopkins The British people should always be the main priority of Britain🤦🏻‍♂️. Every country should always put their own people 1st. otherwise what is the point of a country. 🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlkLightDisco @Smol_Guardian @kyliamerrell It wasn’t disclosed that’s the point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Smol_Guardian @BlkLightDisco @kyliamerrell It is not me setting rules🙄. That was me giving a suggestion🤦🏻‍♂️. every school/daycare has a private room, be it a staff room or storage room etc... if you need to pray, do it discreetly in your private time away from the young children, just as if the teacher was to smoke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Their job is to debate. thats what they did. they aint effected by the letters they get,they use it as ammo against each other. It wasnt brave or deserves a tribute,they aint dead. Jeremy is artificially empathetic of their stories to hide the fact labour is full of antiSemitism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn Pay tribute? they are debating. its what they are payed to do. there is nothing special about it at all. Dont make out you’re praising &amp; tributing them just because its about anti-Semitism just to try sweep the fact that labour is full of antiSemitics under the rug😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB   https://t.co/Qhb4QRZXDh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking I don’t think remain will like this, it doesn’t really fit into their apocalyptic view of brexit they try so hard to push down everyone’s throats 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 They choose to work there so whats the issue. if you dont like it,done listen or go there. I dont like church, so I just dont go or listen to it then it doesnt effect me,so simple. besides brothels should be legalised&amp;17+ guarantee busting a nut will keep the stabbing rate down😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lmfao 😂😂  https://t.co/imICsa7y6a<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dapperlaughs He isn’t a criminal, he is addicted and in a bad place within himself that he can not control alone, he needs help not punishment. Punishing an addict only makes them fall deeper into the hole they’re already in😕. Plus he is one half of a national treasure. We don’t have many😆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Didn’t we already send air strikes over the weekend? Lmao a bit late now...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Isnt the 1st time doctors condemned a child to death in such a humiliating way. Yes the child would eventually die anyway but at least try new experimental treatments. Treating the child will benefit medical science research&amp;give the parents hope for their child,hope is powerful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Why are you reporting on the day in the life of the average Londoner lmao... you may as well tweet ‘person walks down london street with a smile’ now that would be news... nothing will ever be done about the stabbing... the mayor is too incompetent&amp; doesn’t take responsibility.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JadeCSGO Do you want to be drawn like how jack drew rose on the titanic? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FannyJan123 @KTHopkins Lmao... what is racist about prioritising British people in their own nation? You do realise she said British people FIRST, not British people ONLY right? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KTHopkins British people 1st in Britain is straight forward common sense. There’s no hate or racism in that, just logical thinking. NOTE: she said FIRST, not ONLY.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealAlexJones War brings a period of real death&amp;distraction, only to achieve an artificial period of peace. the ‘great war’ was suppose to end all wars but it sparked a bigger war  20yrs later&amp; that sparked the Cold War... how long till another? Its not the people who want war, its governments<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @MatthewStadlen He would call it what ever he could if it gains him more support or makes him look like the good guy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dapperlaughs My girlfriend is my mum 🤫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KTHopkins Disgraceful and pathetic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet Think about it...no one wakes up &amp;thinks, I want a war today, I hope there is one so I can lose everything &amp; live in fear for the next 5+years. Its just governments who creat the Wars&amp; problem then send us in to fight &amp; die when all we want it to sit at home watching eastenders😅<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC Bombings, occupation/invasion or an over throw is not a sensible or logical answer!

<|startoftext|>@hailcaesar7 @LBC @ShelaghFogarty Lmao... Islam has its own law system, sharia law. And is implemented throughout the entire Middle East, North Africa and South Asia...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @ShelaghFogarty Don’t make this about Islam either... its about religion as a whole! Stop pussy footing around Islam constantly... its so pathetic and stop making islam out to be the victim all the time... more people suffer under Islam’s control than prosper 🙄😴😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @ShelaghFogarty Yes! Religion is not fact, it is a belief! If you want to worship dark age books then go to a church, mosque, temple etc... in your spare time! religion should be taught as a personal private thing, no drummed into young impressionable kids minds who know no better!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zoeclarkvlogs @CalvinKlein Your belly button is leaking 😳😄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Serkaddis_ @AliyahGiggle @Nieves_Austin @Thompsons_Cat @kyliamerrell You lot are taking this religious shit way to far. I simply stated I dislike that a child so young &amp;impressionable who knows no better is being exposed to things they cannot understand&amp;can dramatically effect their life before they’re able to make an informed, conscious decision.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ASweetBabiJay @kyliamerrell My logic is fine. but you all cry b/c religion pops up😴so to you my opinion is wrong unless I ‘praise the Lord’! My issue is,impressionable vulnerable children being influenced by things they dont understand, especially by strangers&amp;at that age they believe anything😬🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KTHopkins I’m actually ashamed and disgusted by my country... Its a pathetic, weak &amp; scared place to be &amp; Its getting to the point where I’m ashamed to call myself British... and I’m usually ‘proud’ to be British 😂🤷🏻‍♂️🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Thompsons_Cat @kyliamerrell i would say the same about all religious practices from all religions. I do not agree with imposing religion onto young impressionable children who know no better nor understand, especially when its from strangers who dont inform the parents for concent...its literal brainwashing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@connorharding3 @Nieves_Austin @Thompsons_Cat @kyliamerrell lol, when was the last time the KKK was in the news haha. are they even a thing still? they are so small and insignificant. &amp; the crusades happened so long ago it isnt even relevant to bring up anymore. christianity is nothing more than a few holiday traditions nowadays haha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlkLightDisco @kyliamerrell lol, where was i 'setting rules'? you make no sense...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoungYumm_ee @kyliamerrell it was clear in her tweet they gave no consent (even though they are fine with it). just because my opinion is different to yours doesn't mean I should mind my own business either and I'm not American, so why would I worry about school shootings lmfao.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC What the fuck do you mean ‘suspected’ burglar? The cunt was in the old guys private home with a screwdriver, stealing the guys personal property! If the cunt didn’t want to die then he shouldn’t of been stealing. Its funny&amp; his own fault he got mugged off by a man 40+ years older<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dapperlaughs Hunstanton 🌊🐟☀️🏊🏼‍♀️🏄🏼‍♂️⛵️💩🕳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kyliamerrell Yikes. I mean sure, its cute he is learning &amp;picking things up but it shows how impressionable young minds are. The child has no clue what he is doing. they shouldnt be praying in front of young children anyway, especially without consulting the parents. Do it in the staff room😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB No it makes people think they can get away with shit and be sneaky. it makes them laugh at the police for having less power...the police are meant to be the ones keeping people in check.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ufc @TeamKhabib Its not surprising that he won. his opponent was ill prepared. 2 guys pulled out days from the fight... its basically like going up to someone in the street&amp;punching them in the face when they aint expecting it, its unfair &amp; cheap shot.

<|startoftext|>@KTHopkins This is so true! I lived in west London half my life, I loved london&amp;after 12years I came back. but I am literally scared to go to the corner shop...most people I was at school with are druggies&amp;the areas are so degraded &amp;dirty, &amp;its only 10% white too, no native Britain🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tartarus_62 @Greekgodx Omfg lmao I hope @Greekgodx sees this 🙏🏼👀😂😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @beverleyturner The only person blind to the disgraceful state of london with the killings (now on the level of America’s shootings) is sadiq khan! He either tells us to live with it like the terror attacks or just pushes the blame on others!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC James cleverly is right... sadiq khan just pushes the blame on every chance he gets. London is degrading dramatically thanks to khan... it’s disgraceful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Why are people obese?...well its extremely simple. fast food is very cheap...most families struggle with money so they have to buy the cheap junk food from shops. the ‘healthy’ food is far too expensive&amp; impractical for struggling homes! Sugar tax wont fix it, it makes it worse!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Were such a joke... arresting people for(non-endorsing) jokes!&amp;now for protecting our lives and property...its a fucking disgrace!&amp;its only getting worse. if that idiot didnt want to get stabbed in the chest, dont break into peoples private homes &amp; steal their stuff...simple...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC ...&amp; its largely males, in general, who get abuse or‘come under fire’ for simply being male&amp;being interested in something more than females are. YOU CANT FORCE ALL WOMEN INTO DOING THINGS SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE FEMALE, THEY COULD SIMPLY NOT BE INTERESTED IN SOME THINGS. stop it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Fuck Yeah! Feminism! Equality for all women!.. Lets force women into doing everything possible!, even if they simply just aint interested in something, we have to force them in!. Its a joke!, feminism is more about oppressing, dictating &amp; pressuring women than it is equality!...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC #FarageOnLBC if anything, John Bercow's grandstanding, was branding women as weak and not able to stand up for themselves. Boris wasn't sexist... he was in the middle of talking and a name slipped his mind for a moment... it happens all the time...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB ughhh...this is still being talked about?... if you're going to ban smoking while walking (which is ridiculous by the way, even though I don't smoke) then ban smoking full stop. wait what?... you make too much money from selling cigarettes to ban them?? go figure! 😆🤦‍♂️💤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB Has this woman heard of wind by any chance?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amazingatheist Frustration, disappointment, shame and general face palming...a lot! 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🙄🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CorbynistaEdith @GaryLineker @Nigel_Farage He stuck nothing to him lmfao! Nigel was making a statement of how much waste the EU creates. thousands of fish are dumped back dead daily because they ain’t on the EUs quota... &amp; how British fishing waters are being taken away by the EU, destroying our costal cities/towns!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryLineker Our countrys surrounded by water. &amp;youre happy for our right to fish in it to be taken away!? RIP costal cities. its ok for you,you have a big house made of walkers crisps, you dont need to worry about peasant fishermen jobs. You may hate farage but its about fisheries not him..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CorbynistaEdith Your ‘gender(s)’ probably confused their primitive brains lmao!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @IainDale Just because a French business won the contract to make them, does NOT mean its anything to do with the EU or Brexit...this is not a brexit matter or even a matter at all... its just how businesses work. We are leaving the EU,not the planet ffs, we can still do business 🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Good, the show should continue. People have been shitting all over ant instead of supporting him! throwing abuse only makes his worse, he isn’t a bad person, he is just in a bad place.  #GIveHelpNotHate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stillgray @RealAlexJones Funny how mocking nazis is‘grossly offensive’but a big blockbuster film depicting exactly how they was is perfectly fine 🤗. Im not hating on the films, I like nazi films...wait, I mean I dont like nazi, I like the films that happen to be based around th....ah fuck, I’m arrested!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreitbartLondon Guarantee most the allegations are false, that shit blew up too big too quick not to have some limelight addicts trying to ruin someones life for 5mins or fame on 10 o’clock news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OMGitsAliA Absolutely stupid, just skip a year of a new cod game and pump out a fully remastered MW2! It’s silly how much money they’d actually make from a remaster, guarantee it’s more than to 2 last cods combined.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xaj84 @LBC @Nigel_Farage Lmfao, better send the EU a BIIIGGGGGGG fine then. They dump thousands of dead fish back into the sea daily, they are after specific fish so any fish caught that’s not on their quotas are discarded!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Graham_RM13 @LBC @Nigel_Farage Breaks several environmental laws does it? Tell the EU that then, they are  the ones fishing in our waters for specific types of fish, any fish that are caught and not on the EU’s quota is tossed back into the sea dead...  https://t.co/EH1QQiqVVA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC I thought LBC wasn’t meant to take sides? Ain’t they meant to be neutral in the conversation? Lmao, don’t seem that way with this droning nonce, he is all about remain and literally throws hateful abuse at anyone with opposing views, it’s disgusting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Michaelabooth7 Ughh its simple... they have such a good life inside, food, clothes, tv etc...&amp;they dont pay for any of it, so they dont need a life outside. It was an example of how relaxed our punishments are. &amp; the death penalty is a way to Deter criminals from committing crimes in general...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB You’re right. death is a release, a release to help protect the rest of society. Execution will set an example &amp; put fear into criminals. At the moment, They can happily commit a crime knowing the punishment is so relaxed, even life in prison means you will be out in 2years...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @mrjamesob This mug is alway depressive doom&amp; gloom! Always talks with such hate disgust in his voice. How he has a radio show is beyond me! He hates everyone who has a different view to him. He is so full of bitter hatefulness,his face is a constant frowning disgust pose,its so depressing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @mrjamesob Your bitterness for the UK leaving is disgusting! Stop virtual signalling for remain at every chance, pathetic nonce!! God forbid the foreign secretary DOING HIS JOB, talking to foreign governments. Us leaving dont mean we are refusing to work with anyone, its quite the opposite!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB bring back capital punishment!. it will put some fear into criminals, making them think twice about committing a crime. a lot of criminals purposely get put in prison because its actually a better life in there...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grvgroyper tony blair is war criminal scum, he damaged this country immensely. now he thinks he can manipulate us &amp; stop brexit, not for our own sake, but for his own financial sake he will lose all his dodgy dealing &amp; assets in the EU, when we leave. he is nothing but a panicking weasel!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC how about we help him find the help he needs to fix his addiction, instead of just shitting on him?! yes he is in a bad place &amp; hurt a girl in the process but attacking him will only make him fall deeper into the hole he already is in!  #GiveHelpNotAbuse 🤦‍♂️😞🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RuneScape no fiddly clunky mechanics, little to no bugs, good QA for once and a nice release date to top it all off 😆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC BRING BACK CAPITAL PUNISHMENT! show people who commit crimes, they will be punished! punishment nowadays is nothing more than a £200 fine, a slap on the wrist or a few months in a luxurious prison, where they have a better life in prison than out of it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickygervais who is the one to decide what is 'grossly offensive' or not? what if i find the joke hilarious? do i get convicted too? am i classed as an accomplices? absolutely ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC They’re still in the early stages. having driverless cars &amp; driver cars together, just isn’t practical at the moment, being on tracks would be more sensible but, again, it’s impractical with how the world is now. people want their own control. They still need a lot of work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC So fucking idiotic to think the transition negotiations are worth the time. We won’t get a good deal, the EU won’t risk losing control of more countries, they will force a bad deal down our throat to make an example of us! Walking away is the best &amp; only deal possible. WALK AWAY!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC He is a terrorist sympathiser, ties to Russian spies and defends Russia along with other anti-British traits. he is nothing but a traitor, you CANNOT be in power of Britain if you despise everything British and would help others before the British people.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@COLRICHARDKEMP Imagine if corbyn secretly colluded with Russia to plan the DELIBERATELY botche assassination. so he can play on Theresa mays weakness&amp;overwhelm her with the situation&amp;brexit.

<|startoftext|>@pb611fbe @GMB we are animals too, we have to survive too. just because we are ‘intelligent beings’ don’t mean we have to cry over killing&amp; eating another animal... it’s just how life works haha. if we didn’t breed pigs, they’d of been eaten to extinction years ago anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pb611fbe @GMB That’s the food chain for ya. You don’t have lions with a conscience after killing a zebra. Some species just naturally dominate over another, it’s nature. You know... circle of life and all that...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB Honestly, it’s governments who cause issues...&amp; I can actually see this turning into a military conflict, if not an all out war... we should tread carefully, we have a weak government, they have an obsession with nukes...🤷🏻‍♂️ a reset on both governments will do us all good!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amazingatheist Lmfao, ‘body shaming’. Alicia vikander is hot as fuck. its not body shaming to criticise bad casting of an actress who, unfortunately, hasnt got the same characteristics that her character has had for 20+years&amp; that fans expect to see, fans cosplay as the Lara they expect to see!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowthisnews Lmfao, it’s ‘body shaming’ to say the actress doesn’t fit the characters characteristics is it? Pathetic, making arguments out of nothing. when  characteristics of a video game character have been a certain way for over 15 years, you expecting to stay the same for a film of it...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ASG0987654321 @amazingatheist Lmfao, if you’re going to reply, at least reply with a decent argument, Jesus Christ haha actually pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YesYoureSexist The creators gender is irrelevant,but you go out your way to point it out so you can creat an issue. all I was stating was,why change details of a FICTIONAL character to appease non-fans.Also how dare you assume I am a ‘dude’! I identify as pan-trans,That is incredibly offensive!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amazingatheist Weather you like it or not, the character Lara Croft...has fairly big tits. it’s not sexist or whatever the fuck some people are calling it. It is a blatant characteristic of the VIDEO GAME CHARACTER, just look at peoples cosplays of lara Croft, thats what video game fans expect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amazingatheist I 100% agree with you haha, not being a dick. But it is like taking away yoda’s ears or Mario’s moustache...it just shouldn’t be done. That’s why almost all video game films flop, because the simple things fans expect to see, aint in the films. angelinea jolie’s Croft was better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking One of the greatest minds to ever live. It was amazing he lived so long with his condition, and archive so much along the way, despite his limitations. It felt like he was going live forever! 😔💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @SadiqKhan Lmfao, stop crying. Clearly doing your job wrong. You’re a Muslim mayor of the capital city of a christian  https://t.co/Op2MwXLpQw’re in the perfect position to cull the divide, yet you worsen it by sympathying with one side and telling the other to live with it...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@twilightzone81 @GMB well ain’t you just a perfect little family lmfao. The dad was 100 correct to do this. kids have to learn, life is tough &amp; if you make the wrong decisions or act certain ways, it will negatively effect you&amp; result in something you dont want to do. better to learn early than late.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @NickFerrariLBC For anyone to confuse a child about their gender is sick,&amp; it is on the same level as child sexual abuse &amp;child physical abuse. Confusing young children of their Sex &amp; body, is out right psychological abuse, the worst kind of abuse, especially for unwise, impressionable children!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CelestiaVega just another day for the great old US of A! Lmao!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC The intention of the person,wasnt to incite terror, it was to assassinate someone, a ‘clean up job’, albeit a botched one of course. obviously it should now be classed as something more serious because it infected 21 others, but calling it a terror attack isn’t the right term.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhatTheFFacts Lmao, actually true....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Our government is a weak and pathetic disgrace!, absolutely no backbone or fight in them to stand up for Britain &amp; its values, I absolutely despise every political party we have, literally all bad for our country, its shameful! Brexit would go better negotiated by the people ffs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guyverhofstadt Stop mugging us off. We all know youre determind to make an example of us to keep the other EU nations in line from leaving... you have no intention for a good deal because you are scared to lose your control! youre only getting away with this because of our weak &amp; pathetic PM!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guyverhofstadt I’m British, nothing more, nothing less.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Absolutely disgraceful&amp;disgusting! How do you ever expect new treatments to work if you never try!? Yeah, the treatment in Italy may not have cured the kid, but at least you tried! At least it would help medical science research! How you going to cure if you dont at least TRY!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Terrii_RS It also goes dark when you have to feed the sea monster raw fish in the middle of the platform or a treasure turtle can appear there with a free cluescroll reward. They are the only events I’ve seen so far 👍🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the_sofa_surfer @LBC @MatthewStadlen They ain’t saying the illegal immigrant homeless are a threat...they are just helping remove homeless off our streets, it just so happens that the illegal immigrants get sent back to their own countries streets, they are not our problem, we have enough problems as is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC One less spy 👌🏼👍🏽 moving on...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JagexOrion Omg lmao! 😅 can NEVER be unseen haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABCPolitics Heres some advice...how about you ‘demand’ to work with people who spent years training to qualify for the job, instead of putting them out of work to ‘demand’ the crew to have a curtain skin tone, so you can use it to virtual signal &amp; make yourself look good by pandering to SJW!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulwaugh Haha yeah, but he blatantly don’t give a shit about them. he is only making all these promises&amp; guarantee’s of free stuff for young people, to gain more votes, he is manipulating thier desires because he is desperate for power so he can deliberately ruin the UK, he hates the UK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@knrmlshh @infowars Haha! #castingcouch 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@infowars Haha what a load of absolute shit,its an awards show not a political statement conference, enough with the virtual signalling,Jesus Christ🤦🏻‍♂️😴shit host too...he is a puppet, a sheep pandering to the elites. get Ricky Gervais to host, he hits them with truths&amp; 100% genuine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC HAHA!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickygervais Well this will never happen 😂😂 too much money to be made here boys!

<|startoftext|>@SeamusMcFly1885 @flydnb @LBC @MatthewStadlen Why is it a stupid comment? At least back your comment with a reason, instead of just insulting them haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RogerGrahamD @LBC @MatthewStadlen No, it should only be accessible by going to a church,mosque, temple, synagog etc... it’s a complete waste of education.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @MatthewStadlen OH GOD YES!(excuse the irony). Its a HUGE waste of education! Teach kids 1st aid,how to manage money,mortgages, bills, taxes, debt etc... things we NEED to know!

<|startoftext|>@BubbleBath80 @rickygervais Obviously haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@annamaclurex Lol,now I agree we need to find a way to help people tackle their weight, with the number of obesity rising but scarring them with such a message to the public is insensitive in my opinion. Especially when their weight is due to  a medical condition they can not lose weight from.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickygervais Yeah, Ricky isnt funny at all...that’s why his world tour sold out instantly &amp; Netflix payed a huge sum of money to have exclusive rights to have it on their site...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickygervais CAN. NOT. WAIT!. Gutted I never got to go see you live. at least watching on Netflix I can sit in my pants &amp; not have to worry about being kicked out the venue 😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking HAHA! fucking ridiculous, i wouldn't mind if they did their job, but they dont. their job is to deliver the will of the people but most of them are deliberately undermining the people to stop brexit. so fuck em!, they deserve a pay cut if anything!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ngriff1966 @Frankhaviland @TRobinsonNewEra i put emojis because i found your uncalled for insult offensive &amp; petty, you didn't deserve a proper response, you just resulted to an insult and not an actual solid discussion/opinion on the tweet... so i'd say it was you who is 'a bit dim'. next time reply with intelligence.🤫<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@whoislloydy @LBC It’s labours fault!!, they can’t risk kids playing with toys because it’s extremely dangerous for them #snowflakes , they need to push them into wanting iPads&amp; laptops at 7yrs old so they can brainwash them with they propaganda &amp; continue their legacy of ruining the country! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC ...delete this deliberately aggravative tweet. its consumer habits&amp;you know it is! A lot of people buy online now, no one is going to the shops&amp; most kids 6+ years old are getting laptops, iPads, game consoles now. Dont try to indirectly/low-key blame brexit, it’s pathetic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB WHY DO WE GIVE THESE FOOLS AIRTIME!!!Dont like it?Dont watch it! Don’t think because you call yourself a ‘doctor’it makes you correct, you think the human race got where we are today being scared of everything that might hurt us!?life is harsh deal with it, Dont be so sensitive!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB So who the fuck is she to tell us what we can&amp;cant like!Boxing has some of the worlds most payed athletes&amp;has millions of fans!

<|startoftext|>@Frankhaviland @TRobinsonNewEra You are absolutely spot on! Honestly couldn’t of worded it better 👌🏼👍🏽🤝<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC As far as I’ve seen, all far right ‘terrorists’ are about protecting their country and its people. Not a single one of them wants to harm the UK. Sounds to me like this guy is left wing and he cant/isnt capable to counter the real terror threats on this country, Islamic extremism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC If you locked up returning traitor jihadists instead of giving them free housing&amp; benefits at our expense &amp; actually rounded up the terrorists on your’watch’ list BEFORE that killed us in our streets then we wouldnt have to take matters into our own hands. SORT YOUR PRIORITIES!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuffolkRoyal @GMB @jojojoheeley Well there is enough of the cunts to make a blizzard 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @NickFerrariLBC Are you seriously asking this question?They made their choice when they ran off to breed fighters of hate to attack us. We know if they come back here, they get 1st on housing list, highest benefit income etc...all at our expense!&amp;we are allowing the coward government to do it😡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC He can fuck right off. I’ll never vote for him! he will get less votes too because people can truly see just how bad the EU actually is by the way they treat us in the negotiations! &amp;he wants to keep a leash round our neck for the EU dictators to keep control! He is anti-Britain!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreitbartLondon Disgraceful&amp; disgusting! Was bad enough sentencing the child to death by taking the parents to court to stop the life support.they wanted to try a treatment abroad that could possibly help,even if it didnt cure the kids at least it could help understand&amp; advance better treatments<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeDavidsohn @LBC There is a system called park &amp; ride. Keeps the traffic out, but gets the people in &amp; out. pedestrianising an area doesn’t mean we are going to cut everyone off&amp; lock them in a cage, there will be bus &amp; cab stations at the edge of the pedestrian areas like most already have lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @MaajidNawaz good idea,but with the current state of london its impractical. I like to see eco areas with larger pedestrians walk ways with a push-bike only road system in central areas, Londons cramped&amp;still growing. I feel smaller bike only roads is the way to go for most of central london.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Shes useless, has no vision because she don’t want to leave. If this ‘rebellion’ succeeds then they are traitors of the people, remainers &amp; are the only reason brexit is in such a state! &amp; the EU leaders are taking full advantage of it to make an example of us to scare others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC He is quick to threaten the media for calling out his treacherous acts.keeps quiet&amp;turns a blind eye to his extremists friends&amp; their blatant attacks on us.someone who bites back this hard over so called ‘lies’ has obviously got something to hide, his’for the people’act is blown!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TRobinsonNewEra Obviously. If you want to be in Britain, you play by our rules! Our laws! And adapt to our culture! Our society! Just like we would have to in your countries otherwise we’d either be thrown in jail for years, stoned in the street or executed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC We voted to leave the whole thing! This is a democracy! Respect it! We cannot&amp; should not give in to the losing side of a democratic vote just because they shout&amp; cry the loudest! It’s pathetic &amp; weak!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC If they want to rebel then we will see them in court to be tried for treason...simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC its sad that the option to arm teachers is even being discussed haha. The US need to seriously sort their shit out,2nd amendment is a load of bollocks,outdated by 300years, no one deserves the right to own a device designed to kill. school shootings are like a sport for them now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Not really. I mean,only stuck up selfish people will opt-out,but that isnt the point, after you die your body will rot away or be burnt to Ashe,so why deny saving lives&amp;helping medical science,dont mean the‘government controls you’thats a pathetic excuse to not help save lives...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteMorris @LBC What does it matter when you’re dead? You’d never know they’re gone haha. You will have no use for your body,its selfish to let organs, that can save lives&amp;help medical science, just rot away in a hole. It’s the 21st century, recycling the dead will only help the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Taking healthy organs from dead people to save sick people is a no brainer! Dont be selfish,you have no use for your body in death,it will just rot in a hole or be incinerated into Ashe!Harvesting the organs will help lots of people&amp;advance medical science! It should be law!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC What do I want to hear from the labour leader?...well a resignation would be a nice start, then a confession to his treason with communist spy’s and admission to being a terrorist/extremism simplifier 😂😂🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Corbyn is the typical ‘bullied/laughed at kid in school’in his younger political career, who grows hatred within, and sets out to get revenge and destroy everything but in a sneaky and sly way fooling everyone till the last moment. You couldnt make up a more typical movie cliché<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shadow_frax Ay, gimme gimme!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Yes we should, seems he colludes with a lot of enemies....IRA....hesbola....communist spys.... seems like there is a trend going on, I very real and dangerous trend that will damage the UK IMMENSELY! way more than brexit(apparently) will, if he gets into power!<|endoftext|>

It shouldn’t exist!” Btw this month lets look back at the history of black peoples suffering &amp;keep brining it up keeping the divide there&amp; make anyone who isn’t black feel uneasy&amp;guilty for how they was treated, even though no one living today had any part in it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nerkish This shit happened to me and she got all aggy about it after I moved on from failing...then she turned lesbian( no joke). Nowadays if you keep trying after she says ‘no’ it is classed as sexual harassment or borderline rape... women can’t have it all ways!...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Lol why is religion still even relevant in this day and age, it’s pathetic, causes nothing but problems, hate &amp; death... time to grow up, we ain’t primitive anymore so why hang on to primitive beliefs...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC It’s a waste. its been, 10+ years, No amount of money will find the girl, especially now after so long. Even if by some miracle she is found she won’t know who her family is&amp; they won’t know her so she may as well be dead. Besides...everyone thinks the parents killed her anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Brexit is a big change, it’s inevitable that we would take a small hit during the transition no matter what, I see it like if you threw a pebble in a pond, the pond ripples, but the ripples only last a short time... the only reason the ripple will carry on is because of remainers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrealeadsom Haha so pathetic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IbizaWeekender @itv2 So this is the reason the latest episode isn’t on catchup... 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JagexOrion Could of made the invention stations have a one off build action to use, like how lodestones are a one off activate to use them. But it’s probably more of a nuisance&amp; inconvenience than anything but i like the sound of it :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC the NHS is struggling because its a NATIONAL health service acting as a free INTERNATIONAL health service. the problem is simple.If youre going to allow foreigners to use the NHS,at least don’t let them for free&amp; then expect us to pay more tax for it, make them pay for treatment!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage @SadiqKhan I welcome them back to the UK.... to be tried &amp; hung for treason! Time to toughen up! Silly little trials &amp; a 6 month prison sentence does nothing! It’s like the teacher shouting at you then keeping you in class at break time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Guarantee they are returned, may spend 6-8months in a luxury private prison then be released with a new identity and free council house with a benefit income that the taxpayer has to pay for...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Return them to the UK in chains to be hung to treason! It’s really not a hard question to answer...put that option in the next poll...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC He has no right to interfere in another countries sovereign affairs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC They’re not British, they are traitors! &amp; should be brought to the Uk in chains &amp; then executed at the hands of a woman. capital punishment must be reintroduced to  punish traitorous criminals &amp; to show we have a backbone &amp; tolerance for vile criminals in our society!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@XFuturistichubX @CelestiaVega Hip replacement, so she can move her hips to ride dick properly 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Oh give it up already! The EU is 28nations! There is 167+ other countries to trade &amp;deal with &amp; we are the 6th largest economy with 65million+ population and you think no one would trade or anything or we can’t survive out the EU like the rest of the world does!? So naive...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Imamofpeace I’ll be honest, I don’t have a very good view on Islam with the UK attacks etc... but listening to you, I agree &amp; accept islam and view it better and others could too if their was more Muslims like yourself spreading a positive Islam rather than a twisted barbaric negative one...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC The EU wants to crucify &amp;make an example of us to suppress anyone else leaving, the EU would not DARE give us even the slightest good deal! Its obvious why. We NEED to start to negotiate trade deals outside EU BEFORE the transition is over! We NEED trade deals agreed before hand!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Naldosmanostava @LBC Lol tell the EU to play by the rules then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Our grandparents defended us from hitlers control only to be controlled by a corrupt dictating project, controlled by greedy selfish unelected tyrants! They will crucify the UK with bad deals to keep control of other members wanting to leave! No deal is the best &amp; only deal!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB @susannareid100 @piersmorgan I legit seen a pornstar/stripper with the name stormi...but the Kardashian’s are basically strippers anyway...kylie started off quiet young but guess she wants her daughter to start off younger. The world could do without ANOTHER Kardashian thanks... 🤦🏻‍♂️🙄🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB An overwhelming disapproval of banning grid girls( promotional models) yet we still allow ourselves to be appeased by this minority who actually don’t speak for a huge majority of women but they’re allowed to keep dictating to them how to live or where to work. It’s disgraceful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC And who is Anna Soubry exactly...why should anyone listen to her...Jacob reese-mogg is the only candidate able to lead the Tory’s, he has massive public support and that is extremely important &amp; he never shys away he is ALWAYS open to debate anything...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @JustinTrudeau Wait wait wait...isn’t Justin a devote Christian? A believer in Christ,who is a man&amp; didn’t god create man in his image? Thus creating ‘mankind’...so what now? suddenly going to decides gods female or a ‘people’? Get it together! Making issues out of nothing is so horribly toxic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Don’t push the equality argument onto men until feminists stop putting the women, they so avidly claim to stand for&amp;protect, out of work they enjoy, essentially ruining their happy lifes &amp;losing their home their all because some random women dictate to them how to live their life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@playrust You need an emergency plan to deal with the hackers otherwise the game will die and just be left with toxic hackers 🙁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulpk50 @ITVLorraine @piersmorgan @KimKardashian He is speaking truth. feminism now is  unhappy jealous women suppressing, manipulating&amp;dictating to happy confident strong women what to do, getting them fired that will lead to them losing their homes etc...all because some random minuscule group of womens insecurities...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@momamami80 @ITVLorraine @piersmorgan @KimKardashian Ok, you selfish women keep on dictating to other women who are happy&amp;enjoying their lifes. Go get more women put out of work&amp;lose their homes. Feminism is no longer about equality, it’s about unhappy jealous manipulative women suppressing&amp;controlling happy confident strong women!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer brexit IS happening.But remainers are so blinded by their hate for losing&amp;cant accept democracy.That trying to slow&amp;damage the process will only spite them once brexit is complete. they could help with brexit&amp;make it work even better but they’re just shooting us all in the foot!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer Talk about undemocratic... scheming selfish greedy little rat elitists! We voted to LEAVE!Stop this petty childish behaviour to undermine  democracy&amp;the will of the people! Labour is not in power,so why waste time scheming with them than negotiating with government! #SlySaboteurs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BindiIrwin @AnimalPlanet I cried when i heard the news of his death. as a kid he was my idol, I watched him all the time on TV it was one of my highlights as a kid. watching any footage back of him just makes me want to cry, even though I’m now an adult. he was and always will be a legend!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Everyone who isn’t British should have to pay 20k plus for operations etc... just like in the US!. The national health service is for the nation,the hints in the name!. If you come to live legally you should have to wait 15-20 years before it come free so stop system exploiters!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CelestiaVega ....what.....monkas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC It’s the NATIONAL Health Service(NHS) not the International Health Service. people who are NOT from the UK MUST PAY! We can’t fund a health service for the world, simple. A flood of immigrants into the health service it obviously too much, we simply can not take it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC You do not understand just how many immigrants come here just for free health care, until you sit in a West london Walk in clinic/GP with 2-5 hour wait packed out by immigrants boasting how great it is to come here for free care then going home its so badly exploited!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB No I wouldnt, because I’m not a low life selfish dweeb trying to destroy our society. feminists are now negatively affecting &amp; dictating to women what they can &amp; cant do,to the point theyve pressured companies to fire the women to save their reputation over a none existent issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickygervais Please my lord, bless me with more of your divine wisdom 👌🏼🙏🏼😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Only leavers can handle brexit,may has never known what the hell she is doing with anything&amp;she cant handle it,just look at a picture of her before brexit till now shes aged 30years since being PM.Them 3 are our only genuine hope.but if corbyn becomes PM then we are truly fucked<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kath80040958 @LBC @MatthewStadlen Just remember... it is because of Churchill you’re privileged enough to be able to even type your message. We got real issues to protest against rather than apparent views of a DEAD saviour of the country. Stop with this petty childish behaviour it’s completely ridiculous!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @MatthewStadlen What you going to do?.... go back in time in a time machine &amp; protest to his face rather than on his grave... what will your idiocy archive...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @MatthewStadlen No, its completely disrespectful! weather he was or not is irrelevant, people thought differently then! if not for him, the privileged lifes the students live, would be very different indeed! Show come gratitude you ungrateful petty children, stop making issues where is none...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC It’s angered so many people because its BLOODT RIDICULOUS! Feminists are ruining society... they say it’s to stop woman being demeaned yet they are demeaning women by dictating to them where they can &amp; can’t work to the point they’re forcing them out of work! #JusticeForWomen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC The far-left&amp;left in general has always been worse...most news outlets&amp;people with a voice/platform to influence&amp; manipulate people is leftists,so its easy for them to spread their idea that the left is righteous&amp;right is hateful&amp;destructive. a bigger voice doesnt make it true...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SerWinterGaming They need a good face punch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC There was a load of terrorist attacks/killing in quick succession on innocent people/KIDS of our country,&amp;the government just watched them on a list&amp;did nothing to stop it.&amp;you wonder why he attacked back?Its the government fault but they just pushed the blame far to the right!..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC One attack by a white man against a few Muslims = uncontrollable far right terrorism. Dozens of attacks(BOMBING/stabbing/ramming into dozens of civilians)= part&amp; parcel, lone wolf, no big deal, nothing to see here!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jwenn71 @LBC Because it’s not treason haha he was doing it for his country, not against it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glamead @LBC When was the last time farage &amp; Hopkins bombed the uk? went on a stabbing spree? Or rammed down dozens of innocent civilians on our bridges? They get free reign in our country, protection&amp; sympathy from far left. You’re concerned about the wrong people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@petewood8one @LBC Every grid girl I’ve seen on the news,loves their job, well... they did love their job...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Its petty,disgraceful&amp;damn right disrespectful to ruin other peoples lifes&amp;career just because you disagree.Theres never been an issue with their jobs till you made one you!you feminists have gone to far,again,to the point now youre no longer helping women,youre destroying women!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Wow...talk about push the blame on someone else...this guy wasnt an extremist, he was a frustrated citizen who retaliated, because the government is too weak&amp; scared to deal with the problem, you even got the london mayor telling us to just live we it...so what do you expect...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JagexStead @JagexOrion @JagexClumsy @RuneScape It’s funny because back in the day when I was 15, I’d look at the old barrel chest and think WOW that bosses graphics are amazing haha. New one looks way better :D I’ll have to do the quests on my Ironman I did it on my main ages ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Drives me insane the way he talks! Talks with a kind of condescending smugness&amp; fake insincerity. He reminds me of a villain in a film who puts on a clever smart arse,can’t be touched attitude,who hides behind their place of power but is a weak cowardly weasel when not in power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC You do fuck all Theresa, the country has been in limbo for over a year, youre a remainer who has no vision for Brexit, no back bone to stand up for the British people and just bow down to everyone (e.g. the EU, France) that said, you may be useless but at least you aint corbyn😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SerWinterGaming Isn’t this the game that twitch views can interact with? to drop care packages and stuff for the players Like a game show, kinda like hunger games?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimKardashian you didn’t need to blur your nipples when you’re practically naked as it is... besides, you have a sex tape! So it’s nothing we ain’t seen before, just get it all it all back out!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @Nigel_Farage @GMB Its always the minorities views we hear,because they desperately cry for attention,the majority has no need/want to cry for attention, so it LOOKS like the minority is the majority, majority can only roll their eyes so much to the minority till they need to defend the real views.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Yeah,under every scenario MODELLED by a REMAIN government. Brexit will of course be shaky at the start but will be fine in the long term.Brexit is like throwing a pebble in a pond,causes a few ripples but soon calms back to normal but remainers are determined to throw a bolder in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB LUL! What is this? 😂😂😂😂😂😂 banter king woo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SerWinterGaming Damn, thats shit. Hopefully at release the servers are better &amp;you get a full crew crew to fight the cracken! Apparently the beta barely shows the full game so I’m excited for it, been watching summit play none stop, shame it’s Xbox store... that shit will hurt the game a lot!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cosmic_Slice @LBC And you can believe whatever you want😂, but you can live life off research, just because a few polls were done does not make it true either, research is never 100% correct, look at brexit, research said everything would Collapse, yet things are way better then the research said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC makes no sense, out of all the sports that have half naked girls, some petty PC twat decided to ban them at darts HAHA life goal complete. UFC has 100s of ring girls, gonna make them jobless too? Such pettiness,what harm are they doing?🤦🏻‍♂️lets ban women in offices too,F it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cosmic_Slice @LBC That may be so,but just because they are MORE aware&amp; informed doesnt mean they are aware or informed enough,a majority of 16yr olds dont have a clue about politics(let alone names of big politicians)even if they were/did,it will still be the older generations running the country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Letting younger people vote, will easily lead to even more unwise, inexperienced younger people being manipulated and misled for votes, just how Jeremy corbyn did in the general election last year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC ‘NHS ON BRINK OF COLLAPSE! NO FUNDINGS, NO STAFF!’ Well here’s a couple million charity funds to help with that, wait what? You’re giving it back to us, the elitist sexual harassers?, Why? Ohhh political correctness, ok, we will let ill children die without treatments 🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Wait, I’m confused...wasn’t brexit supposed to cripple the country and lead to the £ collapsing and unemployment to sky rocket?? Why is the opposite happening!? The left will be furious that brexit is actually doing good! 😧 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SerWinterGaming Team viewer FTW 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TRobinsonNewEra @MailOnline Her thirst for total control&amp;power is getting really petty,shes resulted to desperate tactics,ripping down any symbols of the union to pretend is isnt there,like painting over a mould patch.She doesnt care for Scottish people she just cares for her personal agenda to take control<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Well duh!, the only people who cry that brexit is really bad, is the remainers,why?,because they want everything THEIR way! But brexit IS happening no matter what,so they better buck their ideas up&amp;help brexit because it will bite em in the arse&amp;damage UK more than brexit itself!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking no one clearly cared about a tweet 6 years ago.Otherwise hed of said sorry then!People just look to create issues out of the smallest thing!its all about the 5mins of fame thanks to the way the Harvey Weinstein shit blew up in the media&amp;half them allegations were #castingcouch 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lizziedearden Not one comment agrees with this idea of yours haha I feel sorry for you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eelsnikta @lizziedearden None British people should have to pay for treatment, it’s called the NATIONAL health service, not the INTERNATIONAL health service for a reason 🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lizziedearden You do realise Britain is a TINY island, with a housing crisis &amp; 1000s of homeless brits across the country?brining in more refugees will only lead to more homeless brits like the SAS soldier on the news recently. We may have a large economy but OUR OWN PEOPLE are struggling.😔🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking So is he the one who APPARENTLY sexually harassed someone at the charity event? Didn’t think so. So why resign...especially from a job that has nothing to do with the apparent incident, and being the chair of the charity does not mean it’s your fault 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@talkRADIO @JuliaHB1 @NicolaSturgeon ‘s personal agenda to take control of Scotland for herself with a referendum failed,she begged for another&amp;failed,her popularity it dwindling with her excessive lust for power&amp;destruction of 100s of years of unification&amp;prosperity,so she just turns to disrespect😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Oh my god! Brexit it really crippling the country! 😧 🤔🙄🤨 how dare our country so signs that brexit is a good thing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking How many children will die now,without that money to help fund their care&amp;treatment?You care more about looking politically correct than children lifes,Disgusting!You cant go pussy footing around every ALLEGED sexual assault,society is being ruined by so called ALLEGATIONS as is.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LiveNowHere @robbllngtn @LBC The only reason the economy could crash is because remainers are too busy bitching&amp;crying about staying in the EU that they will never have time to prepare for brexit so it will just punch them hard in their whingeing faces.Brexit is nothing but a ripple in a pond for the economy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Bad move! 1. It will cause chaos for the busiest shipping lane in the world, 2. It is unnecessary &amp; waste of money, 3. it will put HUGE strain on border control trying to Vet everyone properly. not to mention the immigrants flooding across&amp; sneeking in, may as well open the door!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ybawife @PunkOnWhiskey @MarkACollett @McMada02 @ybawife its people like you who create racism out of nothing that are  WAY worst than actual racist people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Fucking disgraceful, he served is county in the SAS the most dangerous service their is, putting everyone before himself to protect them &amp; we just ungrateful case him aside! But we don’t cast aside immigrants so we!? Take care of our own before others! Pretty simple! 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Its getting a bit much now. He was ACCUSED months ago, where was they then? Why come out now?...ah thats right, getting their stories straight because its so easy to accuse &amp; be believed, but can never be proven because its easy to accuse for an apparent assault over 12 years ago<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC This whole ‘deal’ is just a way to make an example of us to the other EU members who think of leaving! we will NEVER get a good deal, the EU will never risk losing control of more nations! Walking away is the best thing to do, accepting a bad deal means we are cowards!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Take them up on their offer,What?To remain under their control,not able to make our own laws,not able to freely trade with the world outside EU,to be dragged into their EU army,surrender our money to benefit their elitist pockets!? Its foolish to think we cant survive on our own.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConanExiles Honestly don’t see why people say this game is bad and has such a small player base.

<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet France is over 5x bigger than the UK, we are a tiny island with 68million people(that we know of)&amp; We have a housing crisis as it is &amp;have over 11,000 homeless in london alone! WE CAN NOT SUPPORT THEM! Nor should we. Every country needs to put/take care of their own people 1st.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Dont apologise! it isnt fair. Its not them who has to pay for it, its the tax payers&amp;government. Funny how 80% of people benefits have3+ children, they just shag unprotected because they get more money&amp;bigger house to support them. Draining economy&amp; lowers standards in society.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage @Jacob_Rees_Mogg Thank the lord above!

<|startoftext|>@SerWinterGaming personally,I’d like to see some more sneaky sneaky hermit, you against the world, stalking pray from the shadows kinda stuff:D but I’m not fussed, I watch every vid anyway.

<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Well would you look at that!. Brexit is really crippling our economy isn’t it 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Pray in your mosques, in your own spare time...not in the middle of a battlefield where men &amp; women are relying on you to back them up.

<|startoftext|>@LBC no, it shouldn't effect him. they are two separate people despite their relationship... stop pushing the blame just because he is the leader of a so called 'controversial' party.&amp; like your tweet says, she 'APPARENTLY' said stuff, so theirs no evidence? ...the world today🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @MatthewStadlen Why ban it in the 1st place... just another pointless petty political statement. it only gives more trade to the little platform snack shops haha! I guarantee more than 80% of passengers buy the paper before they get on the train as it is anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bl8ant @ms_tina_tina @socialmissfit3 @LBC It’s not about race, so put the race card away.

No matter what vote happens there’s always a losing side,the remainers are no exception!, why should we destroy democracy for the losers to have their way!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking The remainers are so adamant to ‘destroy brexit’ that they are hurting their selfs &amp; their country. WE ARE LEAVING! So get your shit together &amp; try help actually get a GOOD deal. Your pride&amp;pettiness will only hurt you later on.The EU will NEVER give a good deal it will hurt them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking ‘Our country is doomed if we leave!’. How the fuck do you think the rest of the world copes just fine out the EU!? Leaving is like throwing a pebble in a pond,it ripples then go back to clam.But remainers keep on throwing pebbles in the pond so they can destroy the equilibrium!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC By all means go ahead. But don’t be surprised when there’s an increase in racial allegations from Muslims &amp; black youths pulling out their race cards every time they get searched... that’s if they would even get searched. police officers don’t want to be labelled racist...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cmarsh249 @LBC @Nigel_Farage Army needs recruits.Lets let everyone in! Faint at the sight of blood?Youre in!Suicidal?Youre in! Heres your rifle! But remember to aim at the ememies head&amp; not your own! Hehe! Seizures from flashing lights? Fine.close your eyes when you shoot so the muzzle flash dont set you off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet Fucking brilliant, I just got possessed by that creepy shit... now a monster is going to burst it’s way out my chest in the night and start wobbling all over me like in that video 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2E0EOL @AlexRoebuck @LBC The queen represents the monarchy &amp; Britain. She is not Jesus Christ resurrected lol, she doesn’t represent Christianity at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC RELIGION HAS NO PLACE IN POLITICS OR GOVERNMENT!! it should stay within its churches,temples, mosques etc... nor should it be taught in schools... religion should be nothing but a hobby done in private spare time, it should NOT effect anything but the worshippers who practice it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TRobinsonNewEra @MailOnline Ridiculous... is god coming down from the clouds to judge her himself with his mighty hammer of JUSTICE!... no? How strange 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@socialmissfit3 @LBC It’s quite simple lol. Flirting, chat up lines,telling a girl shes hot or fit or beautiful/ good looking etc... the line between flirting &amp; sexual harassment is being destroyed to the point where its become so petty&amp;ridiculous that its sexual harassment to even look at women.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Yes...why should men be penalised for flirting?. if a man finds a woman attractive &amp; flirts but the woman isn’t interested... it’s not sexual assault it’s literally a failed mating call, people forget we are animals with instincts just like any other...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking What she done with @Jacob_Rees_Mogg ? Hopefully pulled him to the front benches. her party needs some common sense and logical thinking to get brexit done properly and stop her party collapsing in on its self, leaving the door open for corbyn...Jesus that’s all we need 🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StrangeLoopGame Release this game on steam already!  lower the price too jeesss 😬😮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Keeping on about this gender equality shit and shoving it in people’s faces only creates a bigger divide...besides, just because theirs more men in a job doesn’t mean we HAVE to give that job to woman...give the job to WHOEVER can do it best. It’s about work skills not gender!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking What she done with @Jacob_Rees_Mogg ? Hopefully pulled him to the front benches. her party needs some common sense and logical thinking to get brexit done properly and stop her party collapsing in on its self, leaving the door open for corbyn...Jesus that’s all we need 🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Ay Theresa may!, while you’re at it, go ahead&amp; add @Nigel_Farage to the brexit negotiations. lets get this thing done properly!No more pussy footing around the EU. Its time to take control instead of the EU making us a statement to scare off other EU countries from leaving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoxyMaryGames Thank you! thank you!  OMG 😍 haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Bring back capital punishment. If you find a spider in your house &amp; you throw it out side, it will only crawl it’s way back in somehow...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoxyMaryGames Lol thats ridiculous 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Start with removing all religious studies&amp;schools.Go to church for that! Replace it with lessons on mortgages/taxes/bills/ first aid &amp; verious other important things in life! Teaching that stuff will release a lot of strain on courts and NHS&amp; benefit  society as a whole.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC How does a tweet calling himself a very stable genius lead to you asking this question? It’s irrelevant. You make a big deal out of a simple harmless thing then try to aggravate responses<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zmzn15 @AshleighJane_Rs Fuck will! let me smash 😂😛<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC ‘Oh no! My personal gain and money investments in the EU will be ruined if i don’t find a way to destroy brexit!’ Fuck off! Tony blair is irrelevant! Isn’t he lucky he wasn’t locked up for the iraq war? He should stay quiet if I was him 🤫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Any politician who wants to remain or blatantly want to commit treason like this mug. is either invested in the EU for personal gain, an elitist with personal financial gain in EU or a politician who is just too lazy &amp; incompetent to do their job so just let the EU do it for them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Treason!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC The real question is, why the fuck is he even considered to get a knighthood!? He has done nothing to warrant such an honour. &amp; you barely hear from him nowadays either. he is just a bygone failure of a career politician...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Christmas may have started with Christianity but to a growing atheist majority its just routine tradition.Religion has no place in the modern world, it was a way to explain things we didnt understand back then. now we have science to understand things,why not worship scientists😄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Same as any other.didnt want to be executed? Dont commit crimes,simple. We need capital punishment back,100% because our criminals dont fear prison...some thrive&amp; find it being a more comfortable life inside than out...not to mention the free reign of radicalisation...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC in the modern day &amp; age, does blackamoor jewelry actually have any meaning or influence to you at all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC a white person!wearing jewelry of exotic African design!?THATS A SYMBOL OF COLONIALISM&amp;SLAVERY OF THE 1700s!?(of which i never experienced) wheres my racism card!?i must create unnecessary problems over a piece of jewelry that honestly has no real meaning in modern times.move on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JagexJD @RuneScape So everyone is guaranteed the outfit? That’s good then, I was stressing about missing the few streams we got left for a chance to get it. Any chance the crates loot can be made a bit more exciting rather than a spirit gem or small Star pretty much every time 😕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaydaBF Fuck all religion. just look at all the drama it creates, no good ever comes of it, just bloodshed, hate, division, violence and so on... its not the 1400s anymore,its the 21st century religion should have died out a long time ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC No we dont at all!Look how the EU dictates to us in the negotiations like we are a piece of shit!Our government is too coward&amp;weak to stand up for Britain with dignity&amp;backbone!With a weak Remain government we WILL only get a bad deal! We need to totally reform all govnts parties<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KTHopkins SAVAGE! haha 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC People protest in their own streets to protect their country and its culture, society, values but suddenly its racist to stand up for themselves its ridiculous&amp;people who say its racist have never actually experienced living in the areas affected, the just assume&amp; judge🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Of course the person whos up the EUs arse&amp;has lots of dodgy personal deals with them would say something so stupid in desperation to protect himself, not us. He is a bygone failure of a prime minister&amp; he is trying to start an uprising against democracy...he should be locked up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Pathetic, childish,selfish,petty... what will anyone possibly gain from this shit?...damaged relations with the US at the brink of brexit, Brief smugness&amp; a taste of a bit of power having barred a president of the USA from a borough he most likely wont visit anyway....🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SerWinterGaming Is this an actual permanent item or just available for Christmas time, like the scarecrow &amp; scuff fireplace? :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SerWinterGaming But seriously lol,He said he was ‘unfaithful’so could of been a kiss for all we know.But I was up set because I enjoy his streams but im mostly upset for him at the amount of money he is going too lose out on LUL.but on the bright side, other streamers can grow and stuff 😛<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ecto1Fan @LBC He is strongly against terrorism.he also has no corruption charges either,its all speculation otherwise he wouldnt be president.inspire people to hate anyone different is the philosophy the terrorists use to justify killing us.trump is trying to protect he country,its his job!...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ecto1Fan @LBC What for exactly?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoxyMaryGames The booty! 🤭😫😍😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC I guess it’s not that fair seeing as the tower was cladded in flammable materials under a labour government, besides who wants any politicians there just for their personal gain no matter the party they are from....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Season 2 of the crown 👑 finished in just under 2days. Not sure if I should be proud of it or not 🤔🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet @Imamofpeace your thoughts/opinions on this? 😄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Imamofpeace UK government is too weak&amp;pathetic to stand up to Islamic extremism!if the people try to stand up for themselves then they are deemed vile racists, thanks to the governments inability to protect us, our culture &amp; our society, Ive had enough of it all, honestly😩🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProSyndicate The sub box issue is kinda like the twitch issue where it delays the notification to my phone when a streamer is live. There is ALWAYS 5-10min delay for toms streams and can be up to an hour delay for others streamers. Dunno if it’s just me but it’s frustrating lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProSyndicate Sorry, we will stop telling you, please don’t hurt us! 😭 but anyway, I NEVER use sub box for anything... I watch the vlogs enough that its the 1st video in the recommended tab on the front page.besides...we know it’s out daily at 6pm so why you need a sub box to tell you haha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CelestiaVega Will it be free? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Imamofpeace This picture represents what the world needs.Not violence&amp;bloodshed in the name of this god or that god...its the 21st century, we should be beyond that kind of petty barbarism, it’s not the 1400s anymore, time to grow up.🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Greekgodx should of carried on streaming hello neighbour and capitalised on it mate. That could of been you with 30k viewer instead of LIRIK, FeelsBadMan 😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Jailed for 10 years, out in 3...seeing as he is a Muslim he will probably get out a lot sooner than 3. Our justice system is so soft to the point going to jail is more comfortable  than the real word. Bring back capital punishment&amp; put fear into criminals!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaydaBF @BritainFirstHQ You go about things the wrong way!deliberately aggravating them for a reaction makes you as bad. That said, they did over react,concidering they are the religion of peace.I want us to stand up for our country,sure, they’ve technically taken over in all but name, its a disgrace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BritishBoy2017 @JaydaBF @BritainFirstHQ The Muslims reacted rather harsh for the religion of peace haha but even so...you’re right, they did ask for trouble going there like that haha...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshleighJane_Rs Happend to me too haha. even got my mum to get it for me but they refused her because they see me with her walking around the shop. It’s funny, you need ID at 16 to ‘gamble’ on a scratch card but not on treasure hunter 😂🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jakeinvaders He has let knife &amp;gun crime go up 40% since he became mayor, not to mention the strikes,delays&amp; rising price in rail fares.his affordable housing plan collapsed&amp; now the prices are soaring high more than ever! Barely anyone can buy a home. Also homelessness is on the rise...still<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lsarsour So what was the capital before?...I’ve always known the capital to be Jerusalem anyway...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jakeinvaders Very reassuring...especially when he tells the people we have to just live with terror attacks &amp; coming from him( a Muslim) is very reassuring saying something like that, it creates a bigger divide. But his Faith aside, he is a all round shit mayor just ruining london completely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katrinki05 @AntiMishk @NatPurser @PyramidHead76 @artworkmagnetic @SadiqKhan He is a horrible mayor, everyone I know no one likes him at all!, less of course if your a Muslims, then he is the next great prophet. Him being Muslims also told us brits we have to live with terror attacked in our streets &amp; stadiums... obviously only serves a certain ethnicity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jakeinvaders @katrinki05 @AntiMishk @NatPurser @PyramidHead76 @artworkmagnetic @SadiqKhan Hope you are being sarcastic...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaydaBF Infiltrator!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking ughh, the women who started that me too thing are ones from Harvey weinstein assaults. but if the 1st 1 or 2 women came forwards about him then rest wouldn't of been assaulted🤷‍♂️then again, there is a thing called the casting couch 🛋️😂🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC LBC's news posts be like.... MAN CAUGHT BREATHING IN PUBLIC!. should he be sacked, lose his home, be forced to divorce his wife &amp; sell his children into slavery and have him stripped naked in the street to be stoned?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Muslim by the way.🤨 what a coincidence!!!!! 😄😄😄🤨🤨🤨 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dilszy @Greekgodx yeah he needs to find his niche. also needs to go home, im bored of canada😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zoeclarkvlogs think of all the D you'd get after😏🚿 👌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dilszy @Greekgodx na its pogchamp. even if its scuffed at times, he is always entertaining,i could just listen to his giggle and enjoy myself. only thing that ruins it for me is toxic fans that intentionally ruin streams for 20 seconds of acknowledgement&amp;the over use of trihard7, its legit cancer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Why oh why is this country so petty &amp; childish. The elites need to be taken down a peg or two...  we have far too much divide in this country as it is...don’t make in worse just for your personal gains 🤦🏻‍♂️🙄🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 petty&amp;childish...its the 21st century,time simple minded people got over such a minuscule thing.we are meant to be the most intelligent being by the way...hahaha.we have actual real issues in the world to deal with,try being as passionate about fixing them as you are homosexuals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC i was SO upset to hear we didnt 100% agree our £50b ransom to get our bad deal, elites so badly crave. because we will NEVER get a good deal, you really think the EU will risk tempting others to leave too?naa dont be naive.'no deal'is the best and ONLY sensible deal we can strike<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Don’t want security after you? Don’t shoplift, simple haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoxyMaryGames This gif made my cock cringe haha 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC It is now illegal to look at or talk to a woman because it is now the worst form of rape.I have also committed another major crime because I just assumed gender of the opposite sex but im not sorry,so stone me to death then chop off my head under our  governments sharia law!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ViveCharlieMag It shows how pathetic&amp;weak my country has become.Barricading up Christmas markets in fear of Muslims attacks,letting them change OUR way of life to suit them!Because to defy/question muslim Islamic terrorism is a horrible racial offence but they can kill us in our streets fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsafrogslife @GrimSoftware @CuckleburyPC @ViveCharlieMag @jihadwatchRS Just like how you made up false accusations towards cucklebury of spreading hatred towards Muslims &amp; getting a ‘warm fuzzy feeling inside’ eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsafrogslife @CuckleburyPC @ViveCharlieMag What is the context then mate?... even though the context is blatantly saying anyone who doesn’t believe in Islam should have every part of their body ripped apart... please, you tell me how else that verse can be interpreted?...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KTHopkins Wait, so while he entertains his extremist friends at the expense of the British tax payer....who is running london?🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngelinaFarlow @LBC The poor guy 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Ok, so she didn’t get a happy meal...next? The real question is why Mac Donald’s has bouncers, it’s not a bloody night club🤔. is there any real issues that matter to report on for once?...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zoeclarkvlogs Amazing!...apart from the razor part...that made my dick cringe 😬😯😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mydogisginger1 @PrisonPlanet Haha 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet Fucking twitters character limit is too low to get my fucking point across clearly! 🤬🙄😬😬🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet Fucking disgusting...this political correctness BULLSHIT is ruining everything and needs to stop!Or we will fuck up hundreds of generations to come... choosing gender shouldnt be taught to kids it will confuse them.it should just be a choice you can make on your own later in life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScherLitNet @LBC @Nigel_Farage Hey,ive got an idea...why dont you give up your pension,from the job you been at for 20+years?(If you even have one)fuck it!Lets all give up our pensions,because a few people dislike/disagree with you.Dont think youre so high&amp;mighty to demand such things because you dont like him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Acerno1 @JuliaHB1 Absolutely agree!Wish theyd make their own party&amp;round up all the like minded people&amp;create a party we can rely on, trust &amp; arent scared to get things done rather than ones that are incapable&amp;scared or ones we are scared of getting power because they will ruin the whole country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage @Keir_Starmer Everything @Nigel_Farage &amp; @Jacob_Rees_Mogg says is just common sense. If you think differently, then you have an agenda that works for you &amp; not the people...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Greekgodx @REALIcePoseidon Fuck me plz?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhillyChic5 You are incredibly hot 😍😍😍 gorgeous body 👌 defo a fan boy 🤤🤤😉<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KTHopkins Haha you like to push your luck 😂 wonder how long it will take though, for the PC brigade to come along or for someone to lay their scuffed up over used race card on the table 🤷🏻‍♂️ bit slow today 😆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @SadiqKhan @Vinny_LBC Watch it be a one sided trade deal that will only benefit them because we all know who sadiq Khan really supports because it’s definitely not the British people that’s for sure 😂....please just sack him already 😅🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@underachievinPT @ganais_anais @IanJamesBailey @ade_huntos @LBC most countries did those things back in the 1700s, so dont acts like we was the only ones doing it just because we was very successful at it. besides in those days it was the way the world worked. as for our 'military occupation' to spread democracy, thats the Americans thing...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Who wanks off to pictures nowadays let alone have THOUSANDS of them, its a bit far fetched&amp; over exaggerated when porn videos are free on the internet so why waste the memory space. Tell him off for computer memory wastage&amp; wanking at work then forget about it🙄. NEXT ISSUE?.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@underachievinPT @ganais_anais @IanJamesBailey @ade_huntos @LBC Theyre British people,protesting in their country to protect their culture,values&amp;people Because they love their home&amp;dont want it ruined.Why do people see it as hatred/racist to stand up for ourselves&amp;call out bad people in our society just because they happen to have dark skin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Its extremely childish&amp;selfish to ruin diplomatic relations between our countries because the current leaders are twats&amp;cry over a few retweets.our diplomatic ties are our countries! NOT the leaders,who will last less than 4 years!thing is it isnt trump being selfish/childish one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Oh no! Humans masturbating!!! Whatever shall we do! The worlds going to end!!... when am I going to hear about real problems we have to deal with in the world? Why don’t we focus on the real issue rather than old men watching porn at work or trump retweeting...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Should he be sacked? Depends on the porn...if it’s child porn then yeah sack the pedo.but average normal porn...what’s the problem? Should be sacked over it but it’s on his work computer so obviously needs to be told off lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC 1000s of pornographic photos on a work computer?no wonder the government gets nothing done,too busy wanking off.+1000s is an exaggeration.who even masturbates to 1000+ photos,what a waste of PC memory...porn videos are free on internet🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC The shit we focus on as a society &amp; make a big deal of is fucking ridiculous, honestly🤦🏻‍♂️. Porn&amp;retweets, seriously!? Focus on resolving real issue please... 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noisymedia @LBC I’m not wasting my time on your idiocy. Your name really suits you 🤦🏽‍♂️🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @SadiqKhan mate,watch the videos trump retweeted...you want to protect that kind of behaviour by your muslim brothers? Shame on you.Instead of welcoming extremism how about you(Muslims)stand up to it yourselves&amp;stamp it out from within.lets face it,thats the only real way todo it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Theresa may doesnt even stand up for her country🤔But im sure the poor little Muslims have been so brutally effected by a few retweets. But if you watched the videos you can see just how brutal Muslims can be. Muslims need to stand up to each other&amp;purge out their extremists view<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noisymedia @LBC Its not about trump!But once brexit is over we WILL need trade deals with him&amp;a stable relationship,not matter you opinion on him! End of.Its not us hanging on his‘coat trails’ its us keeping diplomatic ties,making trade deals,keeping allies. But youre too childish to understand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Weather you like him or not, he is the US president!...the leader of our closest ally!&amp; you want to damage our relationship on the edge of brexit!? Are you simple!?! stop with this pettiness, our government&amp; PM isn’t perfect! my country is a disgrace at the moment!🇬🇧🤦🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KTHopkins @RaheemKassam This guy is spot on! Stop crying over retweets, we have important matters to sort out! Wish you put as must attention on them than fucking tweets! You’d rather damage diplomatic relations over it publicly too, are you dumb? Just have a quiet word privately behind the scenes ffs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Markswords888 @LBC ....🤔🤨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Heard he is turning it into another mosque 🕌 🤷🏽‍♂️🙌🏻😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Hey,did you know the NHS stands for NATIONAL health service? NOT international health service?The NHS is for BRITISH Citizens ONLY!,anyone coming here for medical treatment can pay for it themselves,instead of the British tax payer paying for them,ITS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE!🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackBMontgomery @SadiqKhan @realDonaldTrump “Terror attacks are part&amp;parcel of living in a big city” - @SadiqKhan ,being Muslim mayor,has the powerto integrate Muslims into British culture,instead he rather they destroy it&amp;force theirs in&amp;wonders why most brits have a degree of dislike towards Them.He only cares for them..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBockino @JackBMontgomery @DavidJoBrexit @SadiqKhan @realDonaldTrump He,d rather cry and wave the race card than do his job🤷🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️ but his job only effects muslims positively&amp; neglects the British people.  “Terror attacks are part&amp;parcel of living in a big city” - sadiq khan. Can I say any more 🤷🏽‍♂️😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaydaBF @TRobinsonNewEra @realDonaldTrump Funny they let muslim hate speech be allowed&amp; go unsilenced🤷🏽‍♂️this shits all getting a bit too much now. it’s the 21st century for fuck sake, not the 1400s,grow up!🤦🏽‍♂️ religion as a whole has done/is doing so much damage to the world and it disgusts me so much 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3:10am.....going london at 8am 🙌🏻 should probably at least try to sleep 🤙🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still awake at 3am as usual😩, then I finally get into bed,only to go on my phone&amp;stay awake another hour! Just cant sleep😕felt so lonely lately too, a 1st for me concidering as I shut myself away from people constantly 🤔😄has the worst past 3 years, it’s indescribable🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking I agree with @realDonaldTrump Theresa is too incapable to do anything...but at least its not corbyn letting more extremists in to run rampant in our streets.Or collapse our economy and lie to anymore young people about free stuff whist stripping our defences away that protect us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Depends on the questions obviously. But It should be banned anyway.it will save muslims the energy of keep having to wave the race card every time they are looked at.If they want to be in Britain, then integrate into British culture.Its pretty simple, honestly. Not racist at all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Legend_Arts That look sick!, shame it’s old school 🙄😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaydaBF Ughh, religion...such a primitive &amp;pathetic ideology. Its time we grew up...It’s the 21st century, not the 1400s. We learnt so much ON OUR OWN since them times. We are meant to be intelligent, yet we still let religion, divide, control &amp;delude us. Like it’s the Middle Ages....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Bring back capital punishment&amp;hang the little cunts. Haha kidding by the way🤔 but seriously, who is scared of prison these days? Make them afraid of the consequences! A slap on the wrists makes them think they are bad men for getting away with it&amp; that it’s acceptable...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>people are naive, to think the EU will actually give us a good deal!. the EU will NEVER! risk tempting other countries to leave. the EU wants to keep control, not lose it.&amp; they will make try their damn hardest to make an example out of us leaving!. #FarageOnLBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC A no deal(hard)brexit,is better than a bad deal... who in their right mind wants a deal when th bad benefits!? anyone with common Sense knows that we wont get a good deal, because the EU don’t want others to tempted to leave!So they will do anything to force a bad deal.Walk away!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Corbyn reminds me of emperor palpatine, from Star Wars. Acts like the nice guy&amp; lies to get into power. Also corrupts the minds of the young(anakin)&amp;throws the galaxy (the UK) into chaos&amp;turmoil in the process...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC He welcomes Islamic extremists&amp;will let them take over,he lured the young people vote with his gingerbread house policies of everything for free, he’d only leave the EU in name&amp;will cripple our economy.Every word he speaks is a lie&amp;Theresa’s incompetence makes him LOOK good...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_YoungerZ__ @PrisonPlanet That is the line where the so called ‘victim’ becomes the criminal.&amp;the attention these alleged assaults are getting,people seem to forgotten he line between flirting&amp;assault&amp; worry more about their 5 mins of fame than ruining someone life for flirting. Their need to be new laws.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arxadiax @ProSyndicate I didn’t like the way he purposely stressed his mum out while she’s slaving away to get the orders out while Alice was away lol but meh... content bruh! This is just a TV SHOW😂 kappa.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mattintheknow @davidcavanagh4 @lbcbreaking Haha yes, hard working people... most of us are lazy, on benifits&amp;refuse to do jobs we think we are too good for, hence why we have influxes of immigrants doing our jobs for us 😆. Anyway, We’d never have a huge economy as we do now if not for the royals building the empire.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Imamofpeace Australia is in an extremely bad way with this Islamic take over, much worse than UK...at the moment because there’s less of a spotlight on it over there than here in the UK. Don’t know why we need religion  nowadays in modern times, it’s not the 1400s anymore... #growup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@navin_nath @Imamofpeace @TarekFatah The story is from Australia, not the UK. But yes the UK is becoming one &amp; our government is too cowardly to face up to it because that would be racist to do so, won’t it 🤦🏼‍♂️🙄. It’s pathetic, it’s a problem...so get a back bone and fix it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SerWinterGaming Haha!i remember when my Castle was under siege in 1457.I was sure Id fall in battle that day. But my knights of ren mowed down the enemy at the gates.Thus I was victorious&amp;live to this day!couple hundred years later I founded Australia,the poor Aussies will never know my struggle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking To everyone moaning about the cost. we are the 5th largest economy in the world. It will cost peanuts&amp; it’s largely thanks to the royal family we have the large economy &amp; are as prosperous as we are😂 so you’re welcome &amp; show some gratitude. #royalwedding<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidcavanagh4 @lbcbreaking 5th largest economy in the world by the way. And it’s largely thanks to the royal family  😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC How about we stop blaming others&amp; realise most people just want change, not aggravation towards another world war. we look like a kid telling the teacher we are being bullied but they dont care &amp; Russia(the bully) is sat laughing at us. If its true,what we gonna do? Start WW3?...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TashaTBHx @paiigeeypuff94 🤨 hmmm oh right 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The shit I see on Twitter really winds me the fuck up!🤬😂 my account has been suspended twice because i get too wound up by it, so I should probably calm the fuck down 😭🤭🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC About time we started pointing fingers at so called victims.The allegations started months ago,why not pipe up then?Had to gat your story straight huh?You cant accept&amp;enjoy something one time,then change your mind years later because theres a big spotlight for your 5mins of fame!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TashaTBHx @paiigeeypuff94 Well I thought it was a pretty cool excuse🤷🏽‍♂️🤙🏼lol. But I knew you’d find it in your heart to forgive me, even if you try to pass it off as not having time 🤗☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paiigeeypuff94 @TashaTBHx You will forgive me soon enough don’t you worry 😇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TashaTBHx @paiigeeypuff94 Well if its any consolation(also a very cheesy cliche) it wasnt you, it was me😬🤔. Had a lot of personal stuff going on. still do now, only worse🙄then I also had issues with my condition😩(if you remember that🤷🏽‍♂️) but its a long story😞it just all took priority🤭😬😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Ever heard of a Tranquilliser? &amp;the fact there is less than 500 tigers left?. don’t even bother saying it had to be shot in case it hurt anyone, we got 7billion humans, im sure culling 1 or 2 of us wont exactly lead to extinction...different story with tigers though...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RuneScape I would be excited,but, yet again,as usual, you only advertised this to the runescape community..!!ADVERTISE OUTSIDE OF THE COMMUNITY!! - adverts on tv! If free mobile games can spam adverts on TV, WHY CAN YOU!?@@ it REALLY frustrates me! You really dont help yourselves,honestly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TashaTBHx @paiigeeypuff94 Okay, so I went a bit weird🤪 and dropped off the grid like a ghost 👻, i don’t even know why, I’m sorry. Not a lot I can say to defend myself if I’m honest 🤷🏽‍♂️😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paiigeeypuff94 @TashaTBHx When did I say it’s ok? Haha If it was ok I wouldn’t offer to make amends 🤔🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TashaTBHx @paiigeeypuff94 🙋🏽‍♂️🤫☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paiigeeypuff94 @TashaTBHx Haha well that’s your opinion but you never met me so yehh🤷🏽‍♂️ but it’s ok I take no offence. How can I redeem myself anyway? Lets turn a new leaf. Start again. Make amends etc...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paiigeeypuff94 @TashaTBHx I’ll take the 1st part as a compliment, I guess🤷🏻‍♂️. I was just clearing up my account &amp; I see she was blocked for some reason, so I unblocked her&amp; it automatically followed her. Shes welcome to follow me back &amp;post abuse to me, you both can slap me too if you like 😊💗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dayz127a @TwitterMoments @PhillyD So all the terrorists who shout allah Akbar as they stab &amp; blow people up, have no affiliation to the Muslim religion of Islam? They interpret the Koran in a violent barbaric fashion.Granted its not all Muslims of course but they are Muslims.anyone who says otherwise is naive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KTHopkins Personally, I don’t think he has a leg to stand on😏. Which is as shame as I believe he didn’t mean to do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JagexShauny Shauny my dude, I’ve got a 1month recurring membership, how does the gold prem membership effect that &amp; my loyalty point streak? Do I just cancel my 1month recurring them get the gold prem,and my loyalty point streak carry on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC PC brigade are quick to judge if someone assumes gender or some shit like that. yet they assume what their children think without asking asking them. When I was a kid, It never gave me an urge to go&amp; rape.because kids think kissing each other is gross!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deejayhome @LBC @NickFerrariLBC *Spoilers* god impregnated Mary without consent,&amp; trapped naked people in a garden. As for the Koran...it’s basically a rape guide 101. 👍🏼🤦🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC who cares?, i couldn't even give a shit if he was called twat bag. his dad should of named him after a disease, seeing as the shit he speaks spreads into the minds of people like a cancerous disease. anyway...my name affects the people who cant pronounce my last name correctly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KTHopkins Its mostly the ugly ones who carelessly breed at 16 in a park,drunk on WKD&amp; weed knowing they can’t financially support themselves and become single mums with 5 kids by 3 dads in a 2 bed room council house living on benefits and no job. Hence why we need immigrants to do our jobs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maramoran @KTHopkins Ok wait 20 years so any proof has gone and it’s impossible for the accused to give an alibi or defend themselves in anyway. So sure you wait to‘blow up his life’ but if its true he did it, just think how many other victims life’s you let get ruined by letting him free for 20years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Good, they could never prove it anyway, it’s their fault for waiting so long to come forward, if he did do anything the victims are just as bad for staying quiet and letting other people’s life’s get ruined...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KTHopkins This to me, is relevant towards the shit that’s ruining Kevin Spacey. the accuser is as bad as the accused if it takes them 30+ years to come forward...they just allow the accused to hurting people so it’s their fault too!...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Greekgodx @lol_tyler1 *cough* STREAM *cough*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Yeah but the shooting has absolutely nothing to do with guns so there is no need to talk about gun control at all because American have the right to shoot each other and one day over throw there future  potential tyrant government...because you know...MERICA!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StrangeLoopGame had this game in my steam wishlist for AGES! &amp;just decided to try check out the alpha but holy F*** $40 for an alpha :O thats just a no go. such a shame too its my most wanted game on steam,if the alpha was around $15 id be okay with it. guess ill keep it in my wishlist for a bit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet I support trans but am not a fan of teaching it to kids, it will just confuse them &amp;create a problem.It shouldnt be taught or advertised to under 20s. We never had this problem in the old days but an increasingly confused youth has created a knock on effect that will cause issues<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NSEWestworld @LBC @iancollinsuk They are acting, they ain’t literally integrating, if you think that any Muslims integrate into our society and our culture you are blind, go to Hayes, go to slough, go to Hounslow, go to luton and see just how much they integrate... you live their way round them parts or else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Put it this way... you will NEVER see a Christian in a Muslim advert for Ramadan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RuneScape I loved the Cinematic ones that flew round areas from quests and the map! Back when I was a new player seeing all the places I had yet to unlock or go to made me so excited!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Spacey been accused of something in the most minuscule of ways and is being destroyed!Yet other actors with violent criminal pasts such as Robert downing jr. or mark Wahlberg &amp; so on, some of which have killed people are currently at the top of their acting careers! It’s all shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Yes! This shits out of hand! None of it has been proven to be fact! it seems to much of a trend atm isn’t it, people will do anything for limelight so dont judge till it’s proven ffs for all we know all his accusers are just after attention thanks to the hype Harvey’s case caused<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@maznicholls @lord_haw @BallyplfcPeter @Nigel_Farage Dont come back with a weak and petty excuse... his situation is no different than a normal person who hates their job...they hate it but still do it! People seem to forget he is their for Britain trying his hardest to not let them walk all over us anymore than they already do...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maznicholls @lord_haw @BallyplfcPeter @Nigel_Farage Haha that’s the ignorance of  remainers. Always think their view is the right one, always afraid of change, always a narrow view and never see the bigger picture, always negative &amp; also seems they assume the rest of Britain who didn’t vote is on their side no matter what...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Moist_Bean @RuneScape Isn’t mod shauny head of community? Also have a word with the advertising team too while you’re their, about time the game was advertised to people outside the runescape community rather than popping out different treasure hunter advertisements every week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maznicholls @BallyplfcPeter @Nigel_Farage ‘He hardly ever turns up’  https://t.co/ReBrQb7YxD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dublinnewsguy @simon_hzero @4136BB @maznicholls @BallyplfcPeter @Nigel_Farage If he is arguing against his own interests doesn’t that tell you something?...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @MatthewStadlen 1.Who the fuck is playing conkers in this day &amp; age 2.What we supposed to do? Wrap all the kids up in fucking bubble wrap and a hard hat all their lives?

<|startoftext|>@Jagexdamo @JagexOrion All this dev time creating new yak models yet the pack yak hasn’t been updated yet... 90% of familiars and most pets have been crying out for a graphical update for years!, also making all pets able to override would be wonderful, got so many cool pets that are wasted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@injusticedoc @LBC This link means nothing to me. The link refers to American states...this is about Britain, while we are very similar we are not the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Yes, barely anyone is scared of prison nowadays...I hear it’s a more comfortable life in prison than out haha. Bring back capital punishment that will make them shit their pants...the crimes will soon drop...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage We still got over a year of ‘negotiations’ before our useless government opens its eyes &amp; realisesWE WILL NOT GET A GOOD DEAL!if we did, more countries would try to leave the EU but EU will do anything to put off others from leaving, such as them demanding money that’s not theirs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BallyplfcPeter @Nigel_Farage And why would he do that?... why don’t you give yours to charity?...you can’t just go around telling people to give their pensions away for no reason. He deserves it for putting up with the EU’s constant shit. Besides this tweet isn’t about him or his pension...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Theres no evidence of these allegations being true thus far so Jumping the gun on destroying him when it hasn’t been proven, is fucking disgraceful but Good luck on this now flop of a film. Everyone is loving this bandwagon going round atm aint they...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Na, corbyn gained popularity by brainwashing us young voters into thinking we can have everything free in life haha #Mugs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RainyScape Honestly don’t even know why they polled this tbh, but reminds me of the 2008 Christmas quest :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC How about you stop covering up what the world is actually like? Instead of sugar coating it&amp; forcing everything to be like a CBBC kids show!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andrew_Adonis Sorry but who the fuck are you?...’we should do so’ how about we dont! We voted leave! Just because you don’t want to doesnt make you right!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSLiveEvents @RuneScape I don’t get it...if the game mode wasn’t/isn’t ready...why release it? Stop rushing all the time! Go back to fixing important stuff...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Haha! Can’t help but laugh... ‘it’s our right to bare arms!’ ‘Praise the 2nd amendment!’...haha time to start growing up isn’t it?...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhatTheFFacts @NetflixUK the guy who accuses @KevinSpacey is on your new startrek show. When you cancelling it too? Especially if/when he’s caught lying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RainyScape ...Not to mention if you managed to get an outfit it wasn’t even an override so you’d be pushed into getting at least 6 keepsake keys= £6.99<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RainyScape The % chance to get ghostweaves seems dramatically low for the 4-5days it was on, I barely got enough for one outfit even after I got keys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Maikkeruu Even more OP with a monthly reset token 😜 but I assume ironmen can’t get them 😄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet Fuck Netflix! Funny how one perv gets called out but suddenly everyone is a perv...Talk about jump on the bandwagon for the spotlight, Jesus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Wait, so we’d rather give terrorist free homes than people who deserve/need them? DONT HOME THEM, HANG THEM! Bring back capital punishment!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Greekgodx lol if twitch starts going PC then they will drop themselves into the grave just like YouTube is doing. I didnt fine it disrespectful at all<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NotoriousMane See you have no argument. You just start to cry when people have a different, more logical view of the world than you. I will pray for you🤗🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotoriousMane And you have zero reality understanding. What has your 3000yr old holy books brought us?Nothing but death, pain, suffering&amp; a talking snake🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SerWinterGaming Haha he is clearly the biggest base bitch ever!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotoriousMane How is that exactly?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage We'd lose a hell of a lot more than if corbyn the bygone hippy was in charge, he will destroy our culture, values, traditions &amp;economy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage She really doesnt help herself considering she knows corbyn will completely ruin the UK, she far off that herself. Fuck them both!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@4drun @SandraBalmer @LBC As if an old man like him will be crying in the corner for being called a bin...boohoo whats he gonna do?Get hezbollah on me? #FuckTheSunToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4drun @SandraBalmer @LBC It's now Corbin because corbyn should be in the bin. Not even autocorrect likes him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TRobinsonNewEra @AssedBaig Oh fuck, lets just hope that isn't the only footage 😬😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC The bygone hippy went there to corrupt&amp;lure the weak minds of 1000s of young people off they heads on drugs&amp;drink to the gingerbread house!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SerWinterGaming But if you do play it, don't live stream it right now because it's 3am in UK and I'm going to fall asleep any second haha 😴😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SerWinterGaming play some Conan exiles my dood! 🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Corbyn is nothing but a bygone hippy luring the young vote with gingerbread house policies,corrupting young unwise minds! This isnt the 60s!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DistanceOG_ @Bizzlesnaff Ahhhhhh that makes sense 👍😆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC NO!. He did well because his gingerbread house policies lured in the young vote! He wants to scrap our culture like a pikey in a scrap yard!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Spokes78 @NashabaSaleem @LBC @SadiqKhan So you rather condem a picture of me with an app filter beard than condemning the muslim mayor for turning a blind eye to Muslim terrorists<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Spokes78 @NashabaSaleem @LBC @SadiqKhan 100% legit beard I swear 😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealAlexJones @Nigel_Farage Where is @Nigel_Farage ? Can't see him at the pill expo thing just some guy in a cowboy hat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @SadiqKhan tells us to live with muslim attacks! Lets terror flags fly free!Puts illegals immigrants in £1m house instead of brits! Wake up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC London isnt OUR capital anymore its now an Islamic enclave capital. how long till i have to show my passport to get into my own capital?smh!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet Thats our country for you. Protects everyone but its own citizens! But lets not forget...its racist to put brits first in Britain nowadays!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Would be happy if this democracy actually worked&amp;the government did what the people wanted rather than throwing their dummy out the pram!🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 Just to walk past someone with a different skin colour is deemed racist nowa days! Funny you can be racist to everyone but white people too🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mvp_kawhi @rickygervais Can you prove it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bizzlesnaff Why did his body explode haha!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickygervais Us who dont believe in god are wrong because we dont have a book written centuries ago by  people who thought the world was flat...👏🏻😒🤔🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shadow_frax There was barely an update this week anyway so the explanation video was probably more thrilling than what update video would have been 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC #FarageOnLBC people really are ignorant about the side of the red bus... it was a simple SUGGESTION of what we COULD spend the 350m on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RuneScape Purple! Clearly. Free party hat plz?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @ShelaghFogarty &amp; the price of the area will fall. wheres the free housing for our British people living on the streets? Why put immigrants 1st? Ridiculous!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @ShelaghFogarty I'm poor but even I can agree with her.Kensington is an expensive area, but if you start giving immigrants free £1m flats...they wont leave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Ok put illegal immigrants before our homeless brits! &amp;encourage more immigrants to start fires&amp; get a bigger FREE house! DISGRACEFUL!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickygervais @KTHopkins The real gods are the inventors&amp;scientists who create&amp;find actually  miracles.Gods never got us to the heavens, scientists did with rockets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickygervais @KTHopkins If we fear&amp;worship ancient books written by uneducated people. if I go back in time with say,a gameboy, would I be worshiped in a book too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayPudd @Marky190977 @LBC ❤️🇬🇧🤙<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NiaGriffithMP @jeremycorbyn @UKLabour He is a bygone hippy who hates British culture&amp; values &amp;will rip the country apart 1st chance he gets! He will leave us weak&amp; vulnerable!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC I think all these marches/protests is naive!Do we really need more instability?More uncertainty?At least finish BREXIT 1st! #CliveOnLBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Marky190977 @JayPudd @LBC Funny because I would of if I was American #MakeAmericaGreatAgain haha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayPudd @Marky190977 @LBC Well none of the parties appealed to me but I voted for UKIP, but without Nigel farage they wont get far...as we see in the election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet I dont support may&amp;I certainly DO NOT trust/support corbyn.but is more instability what we really need right now?look at the bigger picture!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@minty_adam @LBC many of my peers dont have a clue about politics they just go with what they see on TV, barely any would research&amp; look into  what goes on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vinny_LBC @LBC Well the immigrants from grenfell tower won't be leaving their new £1.5mill houses ever again then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhatTheFFacts Disgusting and disgraceful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clakklaa @MudThroughBlood @JuliaHB1 1) its disrespectful&amp;a slap in the face to our culture not bowing. 2) he didnt win the election... he lost...dont be delusional like him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 &amp;people want him to run the country when he disrespects British culture&amp; our Queen!...he is nothing but a hippy with a delusion or grandeur!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Marky190977 @LBC Im persuading no one, im speaking out about a view a lot of people have.&amp;if people agree or disagree with the view its up to them to decide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_YESMATE_ @LBC I have no faith in any party this moment in time...Id say I follow UKIP but even them I have little faith in. So dont assume my allegiance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Also Im 23 so Im only of the young voters&amp; I utterly dislike him, his lies!&amp; gingerbread house policies he cant fund! He will ruin the UK!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC He appealed to young people because of his gingerbread house policies! Corbyn is nothing but a hippy out of his time!&amp;will cause big damage!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Brilliant idea! The foreign aid only goes to the wrong people anyway, even extremists terrorists. CHARITY BEGINS AT HOME!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Lord who?. Government works for the people so they best do what we voted for! We have no trust in them with extremists terrorism as it is!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage enough of this teasing already! When you running for PM!😂👍🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Every British citizen has the right to be islamophobic right now! Extremists attack us with hate, so we only see Islam as religion of hate..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC You expect us to just let MUSLIM extremists kill us&amp;us to just say, oh well we still love you guys hehe!of course the dislike to them rises!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewJRegan I see a man defending his countries values!Its the Islam extremists who incite the hatred the moment they kill us!We wont turn&amp;say we loveU!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet Since Manchester,Westminster&amp;London Bridge theyve played down every other attack to stop us complaining about us being killed in our streets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SadiqKhan @JuliaHB1 This was NOT a terror attack this was RETALIATION!For governments Inaction&amp; Islamic terrorists killing our children in the streets for hate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TRobinsonNewEra Foreign hate ideology worshippers attack the country... government does nothing...natives of the country fight back their self.Simple logic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jesus_is_here_ @garymcphail_ @TRobinsonNewEra Peace loving folks?Where is the peace&amp; love when they kill us&amp;our children in our own streets for hate?You are saying its fine to attack us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@garymcphail_ @TRobinsonNewEra He is not the problem he sees it how it is! Can't blame him for muslims attacking us&amp; our children in the street and not expect retaliation!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TRobinsonNewEra Amen 🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TRobinsonNewEra Bet he won't get banned or restricted for open wanting to kill someone but I say one true fact about extremism and I get restricted 👏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TRobinsonNewEra People are so ignorant&amp;quick to judge!No one even died. I wouldnt be surprised if it was muslim extremists killed us in our streets..oh wait<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toadmeister @D_Blanchflower @Spythecamp @andrew_lilico People want everything done instantly, cant they see this is a huge operation that WILL take weeks! Lets not rush &amp; do this properly ffs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TRobinsonNewEra @SadiqKhan They will have to live with it and carry on like normal like @SadiqKhan told us to. unless they decide to have another go!...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC I dont support her but she has had a tremendous amount of BIG issues to deal with this year, if corbyn was in, he'd only make more problems!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TRobinsonNewEra Pay backs a bitch. At least hope that's what I'm assuming at the moment in time anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shadow_frax Oh baby! More traps please! More unique and diverse traps! Just imagine the possibilities if electricity is ever implemented 😍😍👉👌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fatherdotcom @AVFCWiki @lbcbreaking If he did that it would have deprive you of this honour of speaking to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AVFCWiki @lbcbreaking Grieving or not, they are what they are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@COLRICHARDKEMP @TRobinsonNewEra corbyn's wet dream to destroy our British values, culture and country and surrender us on our knees to his "friends"! #CancerousCorbyn!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC 100% agree with what Rachel Johnson said<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking All the home office needed to do was arrange transportation of the body BACK TO the family. Not being them here, where they will not leave!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking Brilliant...more immigrants chauffeur here to take houses in midst of housing crisis with 1000s of homeless brits on the street! #Brits1st<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC One thing to say about this tweet...pathetic! How about you ask corbyn to step down for using the dead for political gain&amp;encouraging riots!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TRobinsonNewEra @TRobinsonNewEra well shes clearly muslim so she wouldnt protest over the attacks by muslims but would when her free housing burns down!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC No it shouldnt. She cant be blamed for something that is spontaneous&amp;refurbished before she was PM!Go ask Cameron&amp; the labour MP councillor!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet May simply CAN NOT be blamed for this accidental fire that spread out of control due to cheap cladding that was installed before she was PM!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC I see its a large majority of muslims shouting abuse, to the MP who's fault it is isn't for the dodgers cladding! Try looking at Cameron!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet Is that a foreigner attacking him? Would make sense when his free housing is burnt down&amp; he still aint got the queens palace to live in yet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeesWax42916444 @LBC Where is our British homeless citizens palaces and free aid and free housing? Left on the streets with no help, where's the outcry for them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeesWax42916444 @LBC Because the government wouldn't dare refuse incase it insults Islam&amp; muslims. &amp;yet 90% of homeless are our own British people struggling!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr @Nigel_Farage @realDonaldTrump That's the thing... people who disagree with you think they are right but disagreeing does not mean you are right at all! Let trump get on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet Its obviously the councils for cutting corners to save some money! We can not blame may when the cladding was added before she was PM!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the_sofa_surfer @LBC British = born in this country. Simple. it's not horrible at all. If you got nothing left, go home instead of crying for our queens palace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC One big fire with 80% foreign residents &amp; they call for our queens palace...not her fault the council was negligent&amp; cheap<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Its not a crime to humanity!No1 knows when a fire is going to start not even the queen&amp;80% of people there are foreign so just go home then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickygervais I want pretty much all chat with with you and Karl Pilkington! 🙏🙏🙏🙏👍👍👍👌👌👌😍😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LabourMaeve @LBC @jeremycorbyn So cuts effect how fast they put their suits on? They got there in6 mins!&amp;fire escapes won't help when the building burns bottom up...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SylPick @lbcbreaking @jeremycorbyn 1 freak accident&amp; you act like it's a daily thing... their is only so much you can do to huge buildings from the 60s-70s to make them safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mankindben @lg63969 @KWingfieldUK @LBC Over 200 firefighter responded within 6minutes you cuck... their would still be fires if the firefighters were hugely funded or not...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @jeremycorbyn here you go again with your political agenda!Cuts wouldnt effect fires started by household appliances!&amp;The response was quick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking @jeremycorbyn what truth!? This isn't a conspiracy...its a freak accident! Dont use this to fuel your political agenda it is disrespectful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guypeds @Nigel_Farage How's that exactly?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC our government has made a shit show of it as it is...without having everyone else's noses poking in confusing &amp; sabotaging the negotiations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage People moan brexit will ruin the economy... but I'm pretty sure the state our government right now will do that weather we leave or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TugboatTheGreat @Nigel_Farage The saying is "I'm putting my foot down" if you say "I'm putting my feet down" it defeats the saying. I said foots implying multiple people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage No one but @Nigel_Farage is capable of following through with an actual proper brexit! It's time some foots were put down! &amp; said how it is!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmandeepBhogal @PrisonPlanet Labour gets defeated. Still thinks they won. Can you imagine what the country would be like if they did win? Extremist attack. Let more in!.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage That person IS and can ONLY be @Nigel_Farage you got us this far but labour&amp;torys are ruining it but you can carry on &amp; make it a success!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @Nigel_Farage That person IS and can ONLY be @Nigel_Farage he got us this far but labour&amp;torys are ruining it but he can carry on &amp; make it a success!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage We fucking voted leave! So leave we will! this devastating unstableness of the country has opened a gap for a new party one we can depend on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage I sense extreme uncertainty, unstableness &amp;hopelessness in very near future for brexit&amp; the whole country. No one in government can save us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RuneScape #RunePoll voiced dialogue! 👌🤝🙏👐🤙<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking What a shit show of an election. We don't need this with the unstableness of the country with brexit&amp; terror now we got unstable government!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet @SadiqKhan is like senator Palpatine. You think he is a nice guy but turns out to be the one instigating it all to take control&amp; be emperor😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC NO. he is a terrorist sympathiser. &amp; lured young voters in with his gingerbread house policies he will never find the money for. #BinCorbyn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KTHopkins She needs to step down! No one wants a Indi ref2. All she cares about is her personal agenda to be some sort of saint and tear up the UK!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking She needs to step down! All she cares about is an indi ref2! &amp;her personal agenda to rip the UK apart! The scots don't want it so step down!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @LBC @Nigel_Farage no farage LBC show today? I am very upset. But he has to prepare for his return to the frontline I guess 🙌🏻👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage I think its save to say you shall return, but with UKIPs stigma of it done it's job, isn't it more viable to make a new party?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet @Nigel_Farage needs to come back with a vengeance! He left them to finish off brexit but without him they will carry on ruining brexit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @Nigel_Farage this is honestly the only good news to come out of this election. I hope he comes back and sorts this mess out #FarageForPM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage @paulnuttallukip @Nigel_Farage looks like you HAVE to come back now &amp;save our brexit, our country&amp;our dignity from its complete disaster!Only you can save us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @Lord_Sugar @NickFerrariLBC I'm 22 &amp;even i see that corbyns policies where nothing but a gingerbread house to lure young voters in, he'd never of got the money to do it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulnuttallukip im a supporter of UKIP but after this election I do feel UKIP needs to reform&amp;get rid of the stigma of having done it's job<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage This election will ruin the country, we are already in an unsafe, unstable &amp;delicate time with brexit&amp;terror.may&amp;corbyn are incapable!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC #BorisForPM! I wouldn't mind seeing @BorisJohnson as Prime minister. I'd prefer him over corbyn or may any day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JagexShauny Thank Zaros! But now I got 700/1000 useless seeds that took me like 2 days to buy sitting in my bank lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@becasilverstein @icedcoffee @PrisonPlanet No one here supports Sadiq Khan... only the muslims that he lets get away with hate preaching and extremism. Him along with corbyn= RIP UK🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TRobinsonNewEra Ignorant&amp; narrow viewed she has no idea. I'm sure she'd be thinking differently if she got caught up in a Muslim terror attack 1st hand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@icedcoffee @PrisonPlanet They kill us for being us. We moan on twitter about it.... we are the racist ones... *face palm* 🤔🖕👏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet LOL! Don't they do that enough on our streets! what about our right to express our rage! Where's our justice! Where's our action!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TRobinsonNewEra religion should be banned from being taught in schools! If you WANT to learn...go to a church, temple or mosque in your own time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@New_England_ @PrisonPlanet The country may be on its knees but if we all had guns how many more people would die in our streets. Not just from terrorists either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet It's either martial law or war&amp; riots in the streets for the coward governments inability to protect British values, culture and people!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickygervais #VoteUKIP unless you want extremists to rule(labour)or nothing to change just back tracking(Tory)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColinSizzlepaws @jordanfurniss @rickygervais And a corbyn government will let the extremists destroy the country in a year. Don't be fooled by his false pledges he can't get money for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet The government needs to stand up for its country it supposedly governs or the people will stand for themselves&amp;revolt massively. Disgraceful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WestmonsterUK @Nigel_Farage They are playing it down so we dont take matters into our own hands.We will see war in our streets worse than the london riots, guaranteed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lbcbreaking @LBC Funny that. They are always the nicest, kindest&amp;best person in the world you will meet.Wasnt so kind when they kill us in our streets though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepublicStaff NO. Pledging to the people is meaningless! It's what you do that counts! Where is our action on issues anyway? already this pledge is void!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrahamSmith_ @JuliaHB1 Picking away at it don't help our country at all. Pledging to the people is meaningless... saying and doing are 2 very different things.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GrahamSmith_ @JuliaHB1 DISAGREE. The queen is the figure head of our culture. Swearing to the people is just a trick to make us think you're going to do the job...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally one of the big party's has given answers to how they will tackle terrorism  https://t.co/XN03KD2Myi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage @LBC They sacrificed their lives for our freedom! Now 73years on &amp; we are being invaded once more&amp; slaughtered in our very own streets!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SerWinterGaming Oh wow haha I like the tweet 20hours after it was posted lol I'd of been waiting along time to go be first *face palm* 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gus2048 @Nigel_Farage No, they sacrificed their lives 4us to be safe&amp; free only for us 2B terrorised&amp; suppressed by Islamic extremism&amp; terror! It's a disgrace!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Look at Nigel's swagger! It's on point! 👌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThirdEyestate @PrisonPlanet Dont be fooled by Jeremys gingerbread house policys.hes a extremist sympathiser&amp; will hand our country to the extremists 1st chance he gets!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet Holy fucking shit.she is the biggest spastic ever...she literally knows nothing about everything she is meant to know about. #Disgraceful !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC #FarageOnLBC Hunstanton has a tiny police station and is 30min drive from the nearest town with police able to stop an attack, maybe...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickygervais Haha!. Ok, lets just look at the 3 terror attacks in the past 2 months in the name of allah. Still think religion isn't a problem?Grow up...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spikedonline @KTHopkins They can blow us up, stab, run us down in the name of Islam&amp;it not be called racist towards us, yet us just SAYING a minuscule thing is...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Yes we are far too tolerant &amp;even have naive, ignorant people saying they have a right to kill us! How dare they! May is all talk no action!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 The part about "if you dont vote the right way, we make you do it again" is brilliant...,They need to accept we voted to leave! #pitchfork!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage how long till our people have had enough &amp; take matters into their own hands&amp;start to attack mosques &amp;muslims in the streets in retaliation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Home grown extremism isn't home grown. it's mostly infestation extremism, from hate preachers coming from abroad breeding hate in mosques.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC If labour wins, it will be the end of British culture!&amp; will bring our country to its knees! corbyn welcomes extremism! He policy are lies!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage @LBC May is incompetent. And corbyn sweetens the sheep citizens with nice fake policies so he can sneak his extremist friends in the back door!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC I like how an insignificant tweet about extremism gets dealt with, yet all actually extremism gets is a Facebook banner&amp; half mast flags...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RuneScape More clues plz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JagexShauny @Vengance183 Seeing as the nightstone is a reward for having reputation with the Zaros faction, can we get a unique Zaros themed skybox from it maybe?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JagexShauny Hope your bum wasn't too sore from jagex putting you over their knee 😝, guess my nightstone is waste of time now lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RuneScape #RunePoll ZAROS! hands down!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RuneScape @Legend_Arts I love anything Zaros. Maybe duel wield Zaros crossbows with Zarosian praetor theme &amp; wrist style like heartseeker crossbow &amp; tier 88? 🤝<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrKalius @JagexShauny There was an incident on stream resulting in the video being taken down. Though it may be cut &amp; edited&amp; re-uploaded later today, maybe.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC I agree with the guillotine. People need to be scared to commit a crime! There is no real punishments...long jail time just= radicalisation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RuneScape It feels empty but squashed at the same time. I liked the old one...all it needed was to be made clearer and the hints of of actually hinted<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC Also having50%women doesnt guarantee companys will run any better or that the jobs will be done better either. Focus on skill, not gender...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Why MUST they? If you force womens equality then doesnt that defeat the purpose of it? Also why is gender the higher priority? Why not skill<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC people need to accept change! Stop moaning about&amp; being scared of change!. If we can't adjust together we will always be divided!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC yes, we'd feel more united only if Nicola sturgeon stops trying to rip us apart for her own personal agenda! The scots want to stay...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC the SNP only speak for themselves.I have yet to hear a single Scottish citizen say they want independence from the UK. #bettertogether<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CelestiaVega if people got a problem about it...why add you on Snapchat in the beginning. People are so pathetic nowadays man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConanExiles it frustrates me how people get offended over the littlest of things &amp; turn it into a big deal. It is pathetic &amp;childish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC no thanks nicola. we wont give in to your personal agenda. Does anyone other than the SNP actually agree with her? Because I do not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC #FarageOnLBC the SNP&amp;sturgeon need to give up trying to force another referendum, which Scotland already voted against a few years back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC that said, we wouldnt have to spend more if people in the EU didn't swarm in taking advantage of our NATIONAL health care for free too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC yes, a bit of extra tax for free healthcare? It's a no brainier.... in America, if you all ill....your in a lot of debt from the bills<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC the public has spoken! so the Lord shouldn't stall just because they want to remain, they are only digging themselves deeper grave!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC she is wrong, their lives are hard enough as it is! Why make it harder? If anything they should be payed more for the extra effort...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RuneScape #RunePoll in terms of look?, preference? Or usefulness? Etc...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I liked a @YouTube video  https://t.co/4yb8zr8SRy Orange is the New Black - Season 5 | Date Announcement [HD] | Netflix<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RuneScape #RunePoll yanille is the most neglected city in the game, but varrock is a busier place that needs work so do Varrock next<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lucas_Kell @LBC funding is the issue because the amount of people flooding in from EU to take advantage our our healthcare costs us money<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC very tough?,my father can bearly keep his business running due to insane supply cost, tax,rates,rent, he is on the verge of bankruptcy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC I learnt far more watching YouTube&amp;TV, school teaches us useless stuff,when we NEED to learn about bills,taxes,money,laws,debts etc...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RuneScape yes, I used to see the old central exchange as a magical beam full of items&amp;gold connecting all the worlds haha would be cool lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lucas_Kell @LBC the NHS is built to handle our nation not the whole of the EU, we should put ourselves 1st before giving jobs to immigrants<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lucas_Kell @LBC your logic is flawed, you want your own people to be uneducated &amp;on benefits so immigrants can have our jobs instead...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lucas_Kell @LBC we dont want unskilled immigrants taking up homes,jobs,hospitals,schools, even benefits! While our own people struggle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC #FarageOnLBC immigrants from EU come here for our NATIONAL (not international) Health Care, yet we wonder why there is a NHS crisis....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC #FarageOnLBC #FarageforPrimeMinister people are too scared to say&amp;do what must be done!, we need to stop living in fear of offending...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lucas_Kell @LBC y dont we focus on qualifying our people for jobs instead,rather than having our people on the streets&amp;living of benefits<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC #FarageOnLBC we have become lazy due to immigrants doing our work for half the wage, once we leave our people will have to step up...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bruvtweeting @LBC they cut bnfts bcoz 2 many immigrants are claimin so it costs govt too much, same with NHS, immigrants take advantage...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shadow_frax can you do update videos for Conan exiles like you do for rust please? 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bruvtweeting @LBC no, our NHS is at braking point bcoz they abuse our free healthcare,&amp; we get our benefits cut due to them pouring in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UpDesk I want one of your desks real bad, but... you're really over priced 😞 sorry 😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @Nigel_Farage get rid of them, why should we allow them to stay if they cause trouble, either play by our rules or you're out, simple<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConanExiles building tier2 is to far for Soloers, clans advance far faster, so its impossible for solo to have a safe base unless on a rock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConanExiles please balance out raiding, a solo player Is at a massive disadvantage against clans, in being raided &amp; progressing in game<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC #FarageOnLBC #farageForPrimeminister get our childish government under control,it makes us look like fools,trying to ban a world leader<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC #FarageOnLBC we need to put ourselves 1st,its our NHS, our benefits, our country. we are not being racist,we are helping ourselves 1st.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MailOnline how about you report about actual news&amp; problems in the world on snapchat, rather than the Kardashians arses all the time...<|endoftext|>
