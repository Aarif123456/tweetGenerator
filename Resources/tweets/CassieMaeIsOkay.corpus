<|startoftext|>@JohnWolfeYT I feel like it's common twitch etiquette to say thank you when someone raids you! But if they honestly don't notice then it happens but that must sting either way for sure. If I was a streamer I would probably never raid anyone honestly lol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RawBeautyKristi Glad it wasn't just me last night!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__GLASSHOUSE @GabbieHanna I feel this too! I was antisocial before this happened and at first I enjoyed social distancing but now I'm afraid that I don't even remember how to socialize.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GabbieHanna I am a stay at home mom with 4 kids so not much has changed for me. My kids are still going to school and I'm still mostly home. The only difference is my kids wear masks to school and I wear a mask when I shop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnWolfeYT You do you John!  I don't mind how often or how little you tweet. Tweet when you feel like! Some people tweet too much and it kind of crowds my notifications and gets annoying lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just finished coloring Closet ❤  https://t.co/DkpdkkESux<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simonschuster @GabbieHanna If not it's okay I love the book and I'm happy to support Gabbie!! ❤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simonschuster @GabbieHanna Hi! So I pre-ordered the book but I didn't know that I had to give you guys my email or something? I didn't know the details so I didn't get the free coloring book and stuff. Is it too late for me to get it? I pre ordered it on Amazon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to keep posting the photos whenever I finish coloring a page even if no one looks at them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since I pre ordered #Dandelion but I didn't know that I had to give my email to another site to get the free coloring book I decided to just color the book itself! I think it's going to look great when I am done! I love your poetry @GabbieHanna ❤  https://t.co/Jij3SbuSwF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@enderkate4 @gabbiesprism @GabbieHanna Yea apparently and I'm bummed ngl<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@itskatiebitch67 @gabbiesprism @GabbieHanna I didn't know that I needed to put my email into a sweepstakes website so unfortunately I guess I won't be getting any of the extras. But I'm glad I got the book and I'm happy to support Gabbie ❤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gabbiesprism @GabbieHanna I'm just happy to support Gabbie ❤❤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gabbiesprism @GabbieHanna Oh. I didn't know that. I guess I missed out then. Oh well I got the book at least!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gabbiesprism @GabbieHanna I preordered mine on Amazon two weeks before the book came out and I only received the book with nothing else. I'm not sure if they were all supposed to come together? I'm a little confused too but I'm happy to have the book!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@extrafabulous @mrkravin Yes. Being with someone who is kind, patient, and truly loves you is one of the most beautiful and pure experiences you could ever have. I would rather be with one person for life who truly loves me than any random hook up who just wants my body.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tailor31415 @JohnWolfeYT  https://t.co/V17FaOmbBL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnWolfeYT I hate comments under videos that are just for likes. And they take up all of the attention too so that when people like myself, comment something from the heart or tell the YouTuber how much they enjoyed the video, they don't even see it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GabbieHanna The entire Internet is one big hypocrite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jack_Septic_Eye Cute lol 🥰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GabbieHanna I don't hate you Gabbie! I actually think you are really cool and sweet. You are a good person and I wish more people could see that ❤❤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@williamcontrol It's all good man lol I'm 34 and I don't know jack about computers either<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnWolfeYT Yea this virus sucks. I can't do any of the things I normally do too and it's making me feel lonely and cut off from the world. I'm really looking forward to things being normal again. However long that's going to be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimCarrey 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnWolfeYT Omg lol how old are they? I'm not trying to be funny when I say this, but they sound like my 10 year old lol Truly 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RawBeautyKristi Don't drop anything onto the floor because it will become dead to you 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markiplier @TeamYouTube Much respect Mark! 👍❤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnWolfeYT @GabSmolders Thanks John! 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WHY CAN'T WE ALL JUST GET ALONG?? We are all human beings who feel pain and go through hard times. We should be lifting each other up not putting each other down! #Peace #love<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slpaxil @ANDREWCHLMT @halomaraj @satellite_jacob @GabbieHanna Can't we all just get along??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnWolfeYT @Airdorf At least the Sally Face questions have stopped. I hope? Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnWolfeYT I never understood people like that! I mean, youtubers are making videos for you for free for your entertainment! When they upload they upload! Your videos are always worth the wait John and I get really excited when I see that you've uploaded ❤ Whenever that is is fine!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TOTMCoffee @Jack_Septic_Eye Stay virus free and full of caffeine! That's the way to do it king!! 😷☕<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RawBeautyKristi @Auntyplanty No parent is perfect! I guess that some parents out there don't realize this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RawBeautyKristi @Auntyplanty I know that's easier said than done, but the truth is, you know what's best for your child and for you and no one else!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RawBeautyKristi @Auntyplanty I hate to say this, but that's just parenting, there's always gonna be other parents out there who think that they know better. I have 4 kids, my oldest is 14 and I've been putting up with it for years. You got to just do you and don't worry about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RawBeautyKristi @TeaSpillYT I love everything you upload Kristi! ❤❤<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SaraKat02277869 @PSEGLI Yes!!!!! It happened right after I posted lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PSEGLI I was told that I would have my power back by 4:45 in Farmingville so am I going to have it back soon????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PSEGLI Why are you wasting energy and man power on this just fix our power!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@forpzy @PSEGLI Seriously! Stop wasting time on this we don't want it we want our power back!!!!! I have a 6 month old little girl who is overheating in this heat!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PSEGLI Still no power in Farmingville!! Help! Its getting too hot for my 6 month old 😭😭😭😭 these "updates" dont tell us anything!!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dangelno Congratulations!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jack_Septic_Eye Can't wait! Missed you so much Sean!! I hope you have been enjoying your break! 💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJudgeLynn I honestly really like Judge Faith and I think she has a lot to offer the show!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dangelno Can't wait!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnWolfeYT It's okay John moving really is exhausting! I've done it a few times in my life unfortunately and I hope to never do it again! We can wait for your awesome content until you are settled in your new home! Good luck with the rest of the move! ❤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrBeastYT I'm a mom of four and I don't have time for this LOL but good luck everyone who's going to try!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrBeastYT Good luck everyone!!  https://t.co/GpBW9S9FcE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mommak0325 @RawBeautyKristi Yes its been a very tough time. 2 of my boys graduated from elementary school and middle school! They had a drive through ceremony past the school. They will be telling their children about this crazy time someday lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mommak0325 @RawBeautyKristi She is beautiful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iyamsam29 @RawBeautyKristi So cute!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alana517 @RawBeautyKristi Well said! Absolutely beautiful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jp_domino @RawBeautyKristi Adorable!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VictoriaLucas20 @RawBeautyKristi Your children are beautiful! ❤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@queen9_b6 @RawBeautyKristi She is beautiful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RawBeautyKristi This is my baby girl DoriAnne Mae ❤  https://t.co/VE131hSiIe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RawBeautyKristi *are lol and not to mention the first time you hold your baby in your arms there is no other feeling like it in the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RawBeautyKristi And I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world. Becoming a mom was the greatest thing that's ever happened to me. I have three boys and I just had a baby girl in January. I know that you were going to love being a mom Kristi ❤❤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RawBeautyKristi I love watching my 6 month old discover the world around her. There is nothing like seeing a child's eyes light up when they see a puppy, butterfly, or the ocean for the first time etc. You get to experience life all over again Through The Eyes of your child.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RawBeautyKristi I don't even know where to begin lol yes there is stress and sleepless nights, but there's so much good and beauty that the stress just ends up being something that you're happy to do for them because you love them so much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrBeastYT I'm ready!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dangelno I feel like we all gained a little weight during quarantine. Celebrities are humans too!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congratulations!! 👏👏 Well deserved!!! ❤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dangelno CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!! 👏👏👏👏👏  https://t.co/vvmdFmTo2m<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RawBeautyKristi Don't laugh too hard, because that can make you pee a little too 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarlenaStell I had a baby girl too, in January and a lot of my family hasn't met her yet, and I can't even take her out anywhere to see the world we live in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarlenaStell Yeah, it's awful. I hate that so many people aren't being responsible, because a lot of us are making sacrifices, and it feels almost like it's for nothing when they go out and just spread the virus around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennajulien Julien's laugh is everything 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RawBeautyKristi Well said! 👏👏👏👏👏 People who don't want to wear a mask and make a fuss about it are just looking for attention. It's ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gusbuckets Wait.... Gus are you pregnant?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gusbuckets What is happening here? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnWolfeYT Only the first one is good. I didn't like any of the others!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnWolfeYT It was my favorite movie as a kid lol but it always made me sad when his mom died<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RawBeautyKristi Same girl lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dangelno I live in NY and this pisses me off....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnWolfeYT Good luck with the move John and Kimmy!! ❤🍀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you kidding me??? 🤬🙄😤 At this rate things are NEVER going to go back to normal.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RawBeautyKristi You totally look like the kind of girl I would have hung out with!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RawBeautyKristi Shame on any mom who makes you feel bad about any of the choices you have made for you and your baby! I'm sure that they wouldn't like anyone telling them what to do with their children or their bodies!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RawBeautyKristi That's awful Kristi I am so sorry. I am a mom of 4 and have had 4 Csections at the hospital. At home birth has been something that's always scared me, but if that's what you want to do, it's your body and it's your baby, and ultimately it's your choice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dangelno Congratulations on all the new subscribers coming in on You Tube man! You deserve it!! 👏👏👏👏👏  https://t.co/AR2jALhb3l<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RawBeautyKristi So happy for you Kristi!! You deserve every bit of success and happiness! You are kind, genuine, and beautiful inside and out!! ❤❤❤❤❤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimReese1987 @RawBeautyKristi Me too!!! 💙💙💙👶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RawBeautyKristi A boy right??? That's my feeling 😊👶💙<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennajulien Omg this is going to be so awesome!! Can't wait to watch!! 😁😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shannonagins @RawBeautyKristi Me too. You have described it perfectly. Whenever I am neck deep in depression, it makes me sad that I no longer enjoy writing like I usually do. And writing is something I feel very passionately about normally!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RawBeautyKristi That is a common misconception of depression. A lot of people think it means sadness, but really it just means literally feeling nothing, I would rather feel sad than feel nothing at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJudgeLynn I'm sad to see you go Judge Lynn, but I'm excited to see what Judge Faith brings to divorce court. I watch her show, and I do very much enjoy her personality and morals! I think she has a lot to offer divorce court!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RawBeautyKristi I'm so happy for you and your success and the baby Kristi!! You deserve it!! 🥰❤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danielhowell Same 😂😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RawBeautyKristi Love you Kristi!! ❤❤❤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@druidDUDE May she rest in peace 😢 so heartbreaking<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Gusbuckets Is it @abelinasabrina 's???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RawBeautyKristi Don't get too upset Kristi! You have precious cargo in your belly right now! Don't worry, I'm sure it will all get figured out! This just shows how loved you are!! ❤❤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marblesthoughts Very well said ❤ I'm going to miss her SO much but she deserves all of the happiness and peace in the world! I love you @Jenna_Marbles  ❤❤❤<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Skittles The yellow ones always make me happy! 💛💛💛<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@corvidresearch A journal where she can write down her thoughts and feelings about being a mom and any sort of hormone induced emotions she may be feeling. I just had my 4th baby and writing always felt great when I had some time to myself! ❤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@langschleeb @Jenna_Marbles I am going to miss her so so much. It breaks my heart to see her go but I understand and I hope that she finds true happiness and peace in her life. ❤❤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@langschleeb @Jenna_Marbles I've been watching Jenna since 2012. I used to watch her with my dad who passed 5 yrs ago. She got me through his death and so many countless dark times. I fell in love with her, her dogs, and Julien. They always felt like good friends to me and not just YouTubers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PopCulture2000s @RaynbowPonicorn Lol that's cute<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juliensolomita Just make sure that she knows how loved she is Julien! And how much we are going to miss her! YouTube will never be the same without her!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jenna_Marbles I am going to miss you SO much! Thank you for being not only my favorite You Tuber but my favorite person and for giving me so much laughter and joy for 10 years. I hope that you have nothing but peace and joy in your life now. You deserve it!  https://t.co/lM8i6b0a7r<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juliensolomita This breaks my heart but at the same time I love Jenna and I wish her all the happiness in the world.

<|startoftext|>@SVampirr @Zeke12346907 @ImStillHereMk @Beheld896 @ZoeTrent13 @OfficialJlipper @creatingjulia @themzan87 How do you join?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Especially since my Dad was cremated and i have his ashes in an urn in my room. #ripdaddy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So May 21st will be 5 years since my Daddy passed away and the morning of 5/22/15 is when i found out about his passing. So the fact that @JeffreeStar has a palette #crematedpalette coming out on May 22nd is too perfect to me on a personal level.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnWolfeYT I am so sorry about the death of your dad John. It feels unfair doesn't it? Like you weren't given enough time. But I promise it gets easier to breathe. ❤❤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnWolfeYT I had dreams like that when my Dad first died. On the 21st it will be exactly 5 years since he died and I still get them from time to time but not nearly as often. I still miss him terribly but its gotten easier to except that he is gone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikePosner 😢 I hope he is resting in peace ❤❤<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealJudgeLynn Like Scorpios can be passionate and intense. Also wise beyond their years ☺ but they can be a bit jealous and stubborn lol I just love reading about it and comparing it to myself and people I know. It's fun! But I don't make decisions based on it or anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJudgeLynn I believe for fun but I don't let it run my life or anything. It's hard to deny that a lot of the Scorpio traits do sound like me lol<|endoftext|>
