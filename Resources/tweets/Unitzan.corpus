<|startoftext|>@PrettyAfricanX You are looking solid in this video bro.  https://t.co/8fwfGKzdIW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>opportunities sometimes come in the strangest packages. A minority of things come completely random as a result of your hard work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All ideas are reinforced by kinetic energy. Mentally invest in a thought and it will manifest itself into your reality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just a sneak peak into on of the #YouTube studios. They have a bar! #ComeRideWithUs #Toronto #UberExp  https://t.co/qyZ7uR99hP<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PrettyAfricanX @Unitzan are going to be in quite the mix this year. #Toronto, Are you ready? #MixInTheSix  https://t.co/oL601ayrFa<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>seriously just wanna say who will be on the show but I think being low key is soo worth it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You will not believe who we just booked on to get on the Uber experiment!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't even entertain the idea of failure however, it doesn't mean I fear it. Anytime I "Fail" I learn. #BornToWin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I should grind a lot more!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haven't Jumped in the bus? What are you waiting for! check out  JoshB for motivation to conquer any challenge u got  https://t.co/R1KMG59IYf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine if Will Smith actually landed the role of Neo like it was originally planned?  https://t.co/wIidKdz5bH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Its desirable  to win and be the best, isn't it arbitrary not to make a tendency of thinking positive.? Why wouldn't you chose to win?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A can-do attitude is a misleading rational, there is an underlying tone of doubt. Rather a will-do attitude reinforces conviction to action<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Royce Da 5'9 performing this Sunday at starlight in Waterloo. Check out unlikely Media for more info:  https://t.co/FVUPxP3sVs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The mindset you have to get into is Win/Win. leaving a legacy is communal. Don think "I will win" always chose "We will win".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if you subjectively think to yourself of possibilities you objectively create favorable circumstances.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>find a creative way to solve a new challenge. It dosent always mean think outside the box, sometimes you gotta think "with"  the box.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stop looking at the glass as if its half empty/ full. Be resourceful, see yourself as the tap, a source of unlimited abundance and energy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Compete against yourself and you will never win, that's the whole point of the game. Only settle for what is better than you can give urself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The phrase "seek and ye shall find" is not uncommon. in psychology the term coined is a "Self-fulfilling prophecy".  belive and you will see<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I promise I will make you proud one day mom #MothersDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't always try to make things perfect, you had to crawl before you walked. Trail and error is human nature.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you obsess over an idea it stops being a thought and evolves into a life style.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously believe that the saints row franchise is dead! No need for anymore volition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>your head is a space of possibilities unbound by time. Great people never use their minds in the now, they always live ahead of their time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Allow urself to learn and u will always be a student in life. If your primary incentive is always to learn, you will always be hungry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A deluded circle of people who reinforce your insane ideas is a better social ecosystem than people who criticise. stay motivated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theRJMurray Thanks brother, really appreciate it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always get involved with something bigger than yourself! believe in an idea and do what it takes to execute it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Opportunity and time always coincide, perfect timing takes a good eye for opportunity. Be wise to your space, know the right chances to take<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The amount of time you spend worrying you can spend executing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>find the inner strength to move yourself and be expandable confounding variables will always be there but u are the independent core<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even when you dont feel motivated make a habit of doing.Most of the time doing something you need to just requires execution.<|endoftext|>
