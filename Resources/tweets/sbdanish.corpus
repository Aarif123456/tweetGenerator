<|startoftext|>@ajay43 @yadudewhatever If farmers start boycotting jio, imagine the chain reaction, they have a huge network, not to forget they are well connected within their own family circles.

<|startoftext|>@sardesairajdeep @IndiaToday @KapilSibal Hold elections and let the party decide key positions, at least make a core group. Looks like there's nothing in place. If they continue in this manner, they'll be long gone before they even realize.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sardesairajdeep @IndiaToday @KapilSibal Doesn't look like they want to see anything beyond the Gandhis. I understand they are a great family with a history of sacrifices.

<|startoftext|>@rohini_sgh @GauravGogoiAsm is spot on. Love Jihad is an hoax created by the RW groups to try and scare people who are in love. The below tweet sums it up perfectly:   https://t.co/9Gf5ILlJzu  ye nazi, kazi and all the "jis" can't do shit, if miya biwi razi, lol.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@yadudewhatever No doubt!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rohini_sgh Ofcourse they know, but Gov'ts will not say it unless nudged. They've also mentioned that the UPSC jihad thing run by Sudarshan TV wasn't in good taste.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ArghyaS06613075 @KishanThar @khanumarfa @asadowaisi I agree on this part. Yes, we should not identify criminals by their religion, color, caste, creed or region. Once we stop this, our problem is solved, bcoz it's just the mindset, if we stop giving religious color to crime we'll solve the problem of hate and perception, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, this is terrible! Condemn it, hope that family gets justice. What else can we say! But we shouldn't identify criminals by their religion, color, caste, creed or region.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What do you mean? Progressing to stall an elected Presidential nominee is progress? Shameful! I thought the #USA follows the democratic process completely?

<|startoftext|>@ArghyaS06613075 @KishanThar @khanumarfa @asadowaisi I can understand what politicians do and want.

<|startoftext|>@GargiRawat @rohini_sgh Yes, Gov'ts should lead by example. Just bcoz Citizens are not following what they need to, doesn't mean Gov'ts can act the same way. This encourages citizens to break the norm of distancing. On one hand we ask citizens to avoid parties, gatherings, etc &amp; on the other we do this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rohini_sgh It's Diwali time, that child should have been celebrating with her father instead this stress and fear. And looks like there was no need for the police to do this.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Were those observers acting like you? If so, there's nothing wrong with what they did, if they did!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Sadly for you, @JoeBiden got more votes. Tough luck! I can't even say, "better luck next time".<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@richris95 @CNN @realDonaldTrump Yep, check this video. This guy is a Former Aussie PM &amp; he's questioning the largest news corporation in the world @newscorp regarding #climatechange &amp; #GlobalWarming. @FoxNews come under @newscorp &amp; you can see just why Fox acts the way they do.  https://t.co/llG2kSgZ2Q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This guy is a Former Aussie PM &amp; he's questioning the largest news corporation in the world @newscorp regarding #climatechange &amp; #GlobalWarming.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Whatever @FoxNews says, or you make them say, won't matter Sir. The #USA has voted &amp; you lost.

<|startoftext|>@AymanM @mehdirhasan @MehdiHasanShow Exactly! Looks like the #USA has no moral right to point fingers at other nations, and this is entirely because of the actions of @realDonaldTrump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#arnabgoswami   P.S. some of the hashtags bhakts are running, don't even spell Arnab Goswami accurately. May be they weren't paid enough. 🤣🤭<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Why are all your tweets censored by Twitter if everything you say is the ultimate truth! 🤭😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nher_who @yadudewhatever Yes, like so many freedom fighters Arnab went to jail na, and Ravish did not. So obviously!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vishalgoswami7 @Nher_who Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @ABC @washingtonpost Fake like your tweets?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDeshBhakt I think the observations made by #justicechandrachud in granting bail to the great #ArnabGoswami should be the benchmark going forward. One way #Arnab has highlighted those languishing in jails for no fault of theirs &amp; courts not even hearing their bail petitions. #JusticeForAll<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_pallavighosh @TheDeshBhakt It will do good to the Gov't though. They can fill their already crammed jails more.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@zafarsareshwala @RahulEaswar @republic What? @republic will raise their voice against illegal detentions? Or target innocents like @Tweet2Rhea for TRP and propaganda? I think you are living in Wonderland!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rohini_sgh Deserves to be free, but will he get a hearing or an advocate like Salve or Sibbal. That's the social divide which is happening in India, and this is very dangerous in the long term.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nikdoggydogg @SameerS18613065 @sunetrac @AunindyoC @DearthOfSid Likewise, most hindu candidates win in Muslim dominated constituencies. That's why it's called "secular state of Inida".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rohini_sgh SC should have denied bail just for this kind of nonsense. Lol  But hope #ArnabGoswami has learnt how one feels when falsely implicated and sent to jail. What happened to him was wrong, but what he does to others is also wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thevirdas haha..guy witty you 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDeshBhakt Bcoz every judge is not Chandrachud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rohini_sgh @yadavtejashwi No doubt, the might of BJP was stretched by a 31 year old. He almost pulled it off alone. Surely he has a great future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rohini_sgh He's deaf to hear and blind to see all that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thevirdas True<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GargiRawat We can only wish!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbijitG Looks like<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GargiRawat Will they do that with Arnab also?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDeshBhakt lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rohini_sgh @yadavtejashwi Yep, this is a proper election. No winner or loser, everyone had to sweat it out. No easy wins, this kind of a result will keep Gov'ts in check &amp; remind them that they need to deliver. But if you look at the #Bihar elections generally, no doubt Tejaswi is the man of the series.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndianF72990620 @NARAYANRAO12 @logical201280 @AdityaMenon22 All the opinion polls before any election gives an edge to the BJP. It's unfair to say that the media promotes anti BJP candidates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RajeshRanjan38 @logical201280 @AdityaMenon22 Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lucifr79716963 @sunetrac @AunindyoC @DearthOfSid Majority of them don't. Just check this #Bihar elections, the vote share for NDA+ is 38% something and MGB is 37%. RW &amp; LW followers and Liberals are there in all communities.  That's the fact!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nikdoggydogg @sunetrac @AunindyoC @DearthOfSid I don't agree completely, bcoz Muslims have voted for secular parties in 70+ years since Independence (examples: congress and even JDU, even though they alligned with BJP). Like some Hindus vote for RW parties, some Muslims also do. There are LW, RW, Liberals in all communities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichaChadha Republic of Wadiya, lol 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MagicalThakur Happy birthday! God bless!! 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iffirocks @AdityaMenon22 @cpimlliberation Yes, Congress should have let go of seats for RJD or the left parties.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kunalkamra88 RIP!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IqbalJ33504075 @sunetrac @AunindyoC @DearthOfSid You should look for what benefits you first. MGB is a liberal party and it would have benefited you had they come to power. Anyways, this is just my opinion. Not dragging it! 🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BDUTT Wanted to add - Just bcoz AIMIM is a Muslim party, Muslims shouldn't have voted for them. Shud have voted for progress with MGB. Our double standards when we call out Hindus voting for BJP bcoz it's a Hindu party. Same goes with those muslims who vote just bcoz someone's Muslim.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BDUTT Makes sense! If there's no evidence of any kind of error, we should respect the democratic process in #Bihar and look ahead.  #BiharResults #BiharElectionResults #BiharPolls<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logical201280 @AdityaMenon22 All I'm trying to say is, keep changing Gov'ts, that's the only way to keep political parties in check. Right now MGB is the only alternative i see in Bihar after JDU+ ruled for 15 years. Things will change bcoz ultimately they will realize that they have to work to stay in power<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They shud have gone with MGB, just bcoz AIMIM is a Muslim party they shouldn't have voted for them. Shud always vote for progress. Our double standards when we call out Hindus voting for BJP bcoz it's a Hindu party. Same goes with those muslims who vote just bcoz someone's Muslim<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AmroodAdmi @Nher_who @yadudewhatever Agreed! They should have alligned with the MGB. Very selfish thinking on their part.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanishSait Anyways your IPL got over on friday itself. 😂😜<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nher_who @yadudewhatever I pity the Bihar public, they don't want to see the reality, or they fail to see? Either way they're at loss, without a progressive Gov't they'll remain what they have been.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdityaMenon22 I pity the Bihar and UP public, they don't want to see the reality, or they fail to see? Either way they're at loss, without progressive Gov'ts they'll remain what they have been.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AbijitG 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rohini_sgh Laughable! Congress should act real &amp; let the regional party take all decisions &amp; stop negotiating seats unless 90% sure that they will win. How many more elections will they lose before realizing this. Looks like they just want to show their presence which screws up everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chetana_cg @INCIndia That is true. No one else has the spine to fight. All are worried about holding on to power.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SobhanaNair @rohini_sgh It's so hard to call elections in today's world. Trends and analysis and what not doesn't matter, all that matters is the "vote", super happy bcoz the "voter is the king".  #BiharElectionResults2020 #Bihar #BiharPolls<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@shaunakhub @Nidhi @CBhattacharji Yeah, it really baffles me, with the way they were treated during lockdown and the way the central and state govt's handled COVID.

<|startoftext|>@Cryptic_Miind Lekin #TalojaJail mein natak nahi kar sakta Arnab. It is home to crminals and Dons, some of whom #Arnab had vilified on his shows badly. Hope republic is careful with their reporting at least till he's lodged there. Feel sad for him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abhinav52082735 @bainjal @GargiRawat @YRDeshmukh @rohini_sgh It's said #TalojaJail is home to crminals and Dons some of whom #Arnab had vilified on his shows badly. Too dangerous, feel sad for him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yadudewhatever Yeah, sweet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@r_bhaduri @yadudewhatever It's said #TalojaJail is home to crminals and Dons, some of whom #Arnab had vilified on his shows. Too dangerous, feel sad for him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sumitkashyapjha @yadudewhatever Makes sense!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShefVaidya Correct!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoctorAjayita But why are you asking? What's the motive behind this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pun_Starr @GargiRawat 😜🤭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aliyaabbas @AdityaMenon22 Looks like!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pranavmainLFC @Saysniha @whirlybirdguy Also, @sanjivbhatt, IPS officer from Gujarat has been arrested for some case from the 90s. Whenever the Gov't wants they'll arrest anyone who is against them. In #Arnab case, they found a suicide note with his name and the then BJP Gov't had conveniently closed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anubhavsinha May be bcoz dogs don't generally hound their own breed. They hound humans, that's only when they see them alone.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KFILE @mehdirhasan How can they discount any state! 🙄 Is it a mistake of the people of CA that they voted?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shame! I've said this before and will say it again, "The World is Watching". The #USA is the greatest democracy and it should uphold democratic values!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sifill_LDF @mehdirhasan Shame! I've said this before and will say it again, "The World is Watching". The #USA is the greatest democracy and it should uphold democratic values!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rohini_sgh You're right. But for Americans, it is a big deal bcoz they never had a woman of color in such an important position in the #USA. And the things that have gone on of late, has also played into their emotions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marceelias @mehdirhasan Some Trump supporters are saying it's still not over and Biden won't last for more than a month. How are these things being claimed? Check this dude? 👇 Does anyone know who he is? AMTV:  https://t.co/iFJZ5CoiuV<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mehdirhasan That's the RW for you. They play the victim card more than anyone else. Although what they claim most of the time is nothing short of fiction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Yes, they stole it from right under your nose, bcoz you were drunk and high with your policies, thinking you'll be fine. You should have woken up to #COVID, and had you done something at least instead of spreading misinformation, you would have won.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rupasubramanya @rohini_sgh Wow, how did you get to the 8 year old tweet. Anyways, good point. It's 2020, Modi will complete 7 years in office in a few months, all we have seen is India's economy contract to dangerous levels. And our neighbour China isn't fearing the 56", even after the jhula and theatrics.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RahulEaswar Respect you for speaking the truth! Feel bad for #SushantSinghRajput, he was used and now he'll be forgotten. He was one of my fav actors since the kai po che days, we have lost a great talent. Shame on those who used him!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Pun_Starr Oh gotcha! I was wondering how can these fucks get arrested in Delhi. You're right, Mumbai jake protest karna chahiye tha, kuch partners mil jatey #Arnab ko. 🤣🤭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMimanshak @rohini_sgh @Tweet2Rhea Lekin, lion bole tho @Tweet2Rhea! Pussycat bole tho #Arnab! 🤣🤣🤭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pun_Starr Yeah, but why the fuck were they arrested in Delhi?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brianstelter @Nidhi 🤣🤣🤭  Mr. @realDonaldTrump learn something from Mr. West.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMimanshak @rohini_sgh @Tweet2Rhea Correct! #Arnab is that pussycat and @Tweet2Rhea is the lioness bcoz lions don't cry and Rhea stood firm like one. Look at Arnab, always crying like a pussycat. You nailed it bro! Well said!! 👏👏👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GargiRawat Who's bifen btw?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMimanshak @rohini_sgh @Tweet2Rhea At least @Tweet2Rhea didn't cry like him. "Police ne mujhe maara" it seems. #crybaby #Arnab<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GMimanshak @rohini_sgh @Tweet2Rhea Never seen a lion crying like this! "Police ne mujhe maara" 🤭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZeeNews @narendramodi @JoeBiden 🤣🤣🤭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rohini_sgh Arnab is law, court and justice in himself. He doesn't need anyone else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GargiRawat That's fine, only #ArnabGoswami matters to us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cryptic_Miind This is called "jan sailab".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rohini_sgh The way he tried to bully @Tweet2Rhea cannot be forgotten. Whatever is happening to him is his own undoing. Those who are supporting him today, did not even think what that girl &amp; her family would have gone through. Remember her father is also a retired army veteran like Arnab's.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@avishkr @BDUTT @yadavtejashwi @themojo_in @DilliDurAst @shantanug_ @Shubhrastha I'm sure the ED, @PMOIndia and @CBItweets should be able to ask how @yadavtejashwi wealth grew. Why aren't they taking any action?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@manmeetnain @BDUTT @yadavtejashwi @themojo_in @DilliDurAst @shantanug_ @Shubhrastha Correct, let's start with the central Gov't!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jackerhack @GargiRawat Doesn't this sound familiar to folks here in India. Don't let people get educated, don't allow girls to progress in life and get educated. All these are RW thoughts. Sad!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdityaMenon22 May be people of Ind have realized that personal attacks must not be encouraged. All these are personal attacks. How does it matter where one comes from, as long as there is progressive thinking &amp; Gov't. High time the RW stops this moral science classes, we had enough at school.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShoaibDaniyal @Nidhi Shame! What else can you say, just for your political vendetta you target mollions of innocents in Punjab.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sane_indian @dhruv_rathee @MumbaiPolice @TwitterIndia Looks like "jan sailab" in favour of #ArnabGoswami!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ranjona @GargiRawat What about our desi version?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ranvijaylive @rohini_sgh True!  But do they even think of hurting people or causing damage to public property, etc? No!  These guys are as close as you can get to inhuman and selfish behaviour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is how much it matters for the Americans. Black journalist Van Jones starts crying when asked about Biden's victory.   https://t.co/5jSbXunfkV  #USElectionResults2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VanJones68 @RahulEaswar May God bless you and give you all the strength to fight fascism and fascist forces. Stay strong! You all are generally doing fine as a society. 👏👏👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AadeshRawal @rohini_sgh Absolutely! If #DeMonetisation was a progressive step or decision as was claimed when it was done, then why no one talks about it. At least the PM could have spoken about it as their accomplishment during the Bihar elections.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rohini_sgh But why arrested? Were they inciting the crowd or something?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lucilleie @realDonaldTrump Why does this mad man act like this? Is this the end of the world or what? 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BDUTT @dhume @manojladwa @ambkcsingh @themojo_in Pada likha hona zaroori hai international diplomacy, trade and economics samajhne ke liye.

<|startoftext|>@bobbitz57 @StacyInMKE @CNN That's why he can't prove in court. You see so many possibilities, you've listed a few. He can't build castles in the air! Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC @mehdirhasan I also forsee @Twitter blocking @realDonaldTrump forever if he continues this way. Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobbitz57 @StacyInMKE @CNN And #Trump will end up wasting money if he decides to go to court. The counting is so transparent, someone send him a link to one of the live streaming websites where the counting can be seen live.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobbitz57 @StacyInMKE @CNN Loser, yes, agreed! But asking for funds doesn't make #DonaldTrump any less rich. This is for the campaign, obviously he'll not spend from his personal income.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GODsuffices19 @sanket Yes, I love him &amp; follow him for his reporting &amp; journalism. I was only letting him know that the electoral system in India isn't transparent.

<|startoftext|>@DeprivedVoices @khanumarfa Doesn't this sound like jungle mein mangal?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoflGandhi_ Bhai, Nov 10 ko kahi Bihar mein bhi counting stop na karde, jaise aaj Trump bol raha hai.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaureeTurnerOK 👏👏👏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hannahhycho Sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hannahhycho I just saw your retweet, the answer 👇  https://t.co/ZITcY5EGab<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DennyBache @mehdirhasan Oh my, are you following the leads? or just dependent on Mr. Trumps tweets? Don't you see the margin is very thin and if anyone declares blatantly now, what happens if the pending votes change the scenario. You'll look like a fool, so hang on, let them do their work, you wait.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AadeshRawal @rohini_sgh @yadavtejashwi Like Trump, hope Modiji doesn't start tweeting on Nov 10 to stop counting. 🤭😋😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelkosta @RoflGandhi_ exactly how they're doing this. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GargiRawat He must be joking right? The system is so opaque here, how is he guaranteeing this?  The counting centers have cameras placed and live video of the counting process can be seen from county websites in the #USA.  Can we do that here? Can someone suggest to the @ECISVEEP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cominsitu @hannahhycho Oh wow! Good to see protests for the right reasons!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Is it possible for anyone reading his tweet to block him and he's left alone tweeting to himself. 😋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mehdirhasan Is it possible for anyone reading his tweet to block him and he's left alone tweeting to himself. 😋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mehdirhasan Why is he so confident that the votes being counted are against him? But if for example they stop counting, based on current leads Biden has reached 270 right? 🤭🤭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GargiRawat @JoeBiden So from "Stop the Count", Trump now says "Stop the Fraud".  Hang on Mr. President, how are you so sure that the votes are against you? 🤭   Is this the reason for your anxiety?  #ElectionResults2020 #Election2020 #USElections2020    https://t.co/RUuWqTTcq7<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thevirdas Yep, still paying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thevirdas Trump is really weak in Maths, if they stop now, Biden has 270 with the current leads. So he wins!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump btw, if we go by Mr. President's word and stop counting, @JoeBiden wins bcoz he has 11 from AZ, 6 from NV and he has 253 already, so that makes it 270. Is he weak in Maths?  Breaking now: Biden extends his lead in NV, fresh count just came in.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AmarAmarasingam @GargiRawat 🤭🤭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GargiRawat I think all states (BJP or others) should do this. Why should CBI intervene or investigate unless asked for or directed by courts. This is a tool which has been used by all central govt's and hence must be revoked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pbhushan1 Hold on Sir, still 4 states to go and it's too close to call.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rohini_sgh I'm sure they would have banged anyone who tried that, lol.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@zoo_bear @RichaChadha Until the 3rd phase of the Bihar elections is not done, these things will be rampant even more to polarize and divide. There is a feeling that they are already behind in the first 2 phases. What else can we expect?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rohini_sgh True! Imagine what may happen here if our PM was to be questioned like the way they question Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crazyredranting @upine @mattduss @Eric_Alterman Yeah, they try to be the flag bearer of patriotism, nationalism and all that. But most of the time it's for their interests not the nation's.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NarundarM @yadudewhatever Besharam, behaya, begayrath.. got loads to describe #ArnabGoswami, don't want to say all that here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zoo_bear @yadudewhatever Shameless bastards!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Apurvasrani @rohini_sgh True, I clearly see that since a kid. Men can wear anything, women cannot. WTH!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rohini_sgh All elections in India in the last few years "appeared" to be one sided. #GodiMedia thinks they can manipulate the voter by showing them their opinion polls and projections.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kunalkamra88 Is tarah TV pe chillana zaroori tha kya? Wo bhi "danke ki chot pe".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nycjim @GargiRawat And in PA, most of the votes to be counted are postal where Biden has the edge. GA can go either way but the pending votes are predominantly from Dems is what's been said on CNN at least. NV is too close, Biden leading by just 8k votes, they'll announce by mid day PT time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thevirdas haha.. but Trump has contributed so much, may be it'll be enough for the next 4 years also.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sanket Did he think he'll continue being the CM forever? That's the problem with some of these old politicians, they don't know how to change with time, or embrace change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@upine @mattduss @Eric_Alterman I also feel it's bcoz the RW don't own up to errors/mistakes and come up with some or the other counter. Dems and liberals across the globe don't do that, they think it's not ethical, but the RW can go to any extent to convince or win.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@khanumarfa Lol! This is for all those who lived in denial that #ArnabGoswami was a stooge of the ruling establishment. Shame on this kind of journalism and governance!

<|startoftext|>@SreenivasanJain Did he think he'll continue being the CM forever? That's the problem with some of these old politicians, they don't know how to change with times, or embrace change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dp_satish @rohini_sgh Earlier as soon as a certain percentage of votes were counted &amp; it was determined that the remaining votes cannot impact the leader, they used to declare the winner. Amazing thing is they are more worried that they are getting divided than thinking who's winning. That is great!👌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dp_satish @rohini_sgh Yes! What's happening there is not drama or conspiracy like some are claiming. Most of their elections in the past had clear winners, they are not used to this type of close fights which goes down to the last vote. (1/2)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GargiRawat Check the bloke in the background. That dude is on his own walking around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thevirdas Yep, love the transparency and the way the system in the US works. The postal ballots are very important as they also include those individuals who are handicapped and cannot go out and vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rohini_sgh 😜👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hannahhycho Makes sense, we'll unfollow after the elections!😜<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hannahhycho Absolutely! It's good for both, if you reach your goals, whoever that soulmate is, will benefit too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hannahhycho OMG! What Bernie says here is exactly what's happening! 😲👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@upine @mattduss @Eric_Alterman Why is it that the RW is so strong in conveying their message? They're same across the globe. Is it bcoz they are more vocal? And don't back down even when they know they're wrong? #Elections2020 #USPresidentialElections2020  btw, #RepublicansForBiden is trending right now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yadudewhatever What's the meaning of bizarre @salonayyy? #ArnabGoswami slandered, like he did to @Tweet2Rhea, used the media to spread hate for #TRP, was involved in #TRPScam. Pls don't say bizarre/unusual, it's an understatement! btw the arrest is bcoz of sec 306. Did you think of the victims?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rohini_sgh @Tweet2Rhea Funny chap this arnab! Bazu pakda hoga police ne tho mark bangaya hoga. Kya rothlu insaan hai yaar. Is aadmi ko aaj tak crib karne ke ilawa aur kuch nahi karte dekha. Yaha bhi? Lucky hai ki martey hue nahi le gaye, or you'll know how the police behaves with criminals in India.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Vaibhav_Rptr @rohini_sgh Agreed! But as long as you do the right thing, you shouldn't be worried. In #ArnabGoswami's case, he has done nothing short of slander recently.

<|startoftext|>@rohini_sgh #ArnabGoswami may have thought, ki zara tweet karenge, phir hashtag chalayenge, intimidate karenge. "Family has also accused him of intimidating, that's very important to note." Bakhi court dekhe ga, kya jaldi hai, remand tho khatam hone do.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RahulEaswar @republic Seriously? When shall we raise our voice for that widow and her daughter Sir?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kunalkamra88 Ab aamne saamne baath ho rahi hai? Ya danda hoga uske pehle. Suna hai police wale bohot maarte hai?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abhik_dasgupta @BDUTT @virsanghvi @themojo_in Yes, we should call it out the way you're saying, not the way a general prespective is built to make sure the normal Muslim who has no idea what's happening (like street vendors gor attacked during lockdown) gets targetted and trolled and bullied. 🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrakashJavdekar @RahulEaswar @PIB_India @DDNewslive @republic But why is freedom of press spoken about here. What about justice to that widow who lost her husband, a daughter who lost her father?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@majorgauravarya @RahulEaswar Oh you mean there are more people involved?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SreenivasanJain Shame that the Union Ministers are not even mentioning about the woman who lost her husband, a daughter who lost her father. And this arrest is not for his journalism, it's for a case of abetment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SreenivasanJain Save this one also please 👇  https://t.co/VRC0CmdeV1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sharican_t @kunalkamra88 😂👌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pbhushan1 Very touching! Tears in my eyes! No one spoke when a widow registered a case of abetment and no action was taken by the then BJP Gov't, at least think of that widow. #ArnabGoswami has met his fate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chetana_cg @rsprasad When have they? No one spoke when journo after journo got arrested just bcoz they were doing their work.

<|startoftext|>@thevirdas Lol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rohini_sgh Why are Union Ministers so concerned about this so called journalist. Check the list of arrests below, no one spoken then? KC Wangkhem, Om Sharma, MA Ganai, Ashwani Saini, Vishal Anand, Neha Dixit, Sidhart Varadrajan, Prashant Kanojia, Pawan Chaudhary, ASR Pandian, Manish Pandey.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dhume @rohini_sgh @DKThomp @ndtv's @PrannoyRoyNDTV was analyzing earlier on his programme that an overall swing of about 2.5% (all states avg.) in favour of Trump is enough to win him the race again. #USAElections2020 #USElections2020 #USPresidentialElections2020 #USElection #ElectionsWithNDTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mehdirhasan Ask the Indians (not saying other nations haven't) about how tough it is practicing Democracy in our own country. Not just now, since Independence it's been a struggle for us bcoz of corruption &amp; what not. But we continued &amp; voted Gov'ts out for non-performance, &amp; we saw change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mehdirhasan Whatever the shortcomings of this system that people talk about. But if you are part of a Democratic system, you have to vote. Or don't crib about things, bcoz a vote to change Gov'ts is what has developed countries over the years. You will understand if you sit down and analyze.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GargiRawat @rachelparris I personally believe if the woman hasn't planned for it, makes sense to abort, or if there is any risk. If the woman has planned and no risk is involved and still wants to abort, it is wrong but again you can't force anyone. All make mistakes! #polandprotests #polandabortion<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jishnu055 @1CelestialTruth @Yoshita_Singh @Nidhi @PTI_News @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdityaMenon22 They spoke big before 2014, since then it's all crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrannoyRoyNDTV you just said on TV that pollsters are much more scientific than markets, which means they are more reliable. Do you think the same about the Indian pollsters? We can't I guess! #ElectionsWithNDTV #Elections2020 #Election2020 #UnitedStates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cluelesscreatu1 @BDUTT They are fearing backlash and violence from Trump supporters if he loses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mini15840345 @BDUTT Never thought I would see something like this in the #UnitedStates at least.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BDUTT @virsanghvi @themojo_in Even if I agree to this argument for a sec, can we start with Palestine and name and shame all the Jews? Can we do that in India just bcoz of a few incidents. No! 🙏🙏 Name and shame countries that are supporting terrorism like #Pakistan, don't name the religion entirely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BDUTT @virsanghvi @themojo_in Won't agree at all! How can you name and shame a religion based of actions of 1 or 2 or even a group. Despite all what happens in India for example, most of the BJP voters do not like it &amp; are not RW leaning. This goes to show that the general population doesn't support violence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdityaMenon22 Doland Trump ke ladke hai. Family problem hai!! 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdityaMenon22 Is this real? In this day and age also they do these things huh? I thought this used to happen during colonial times. But it looks like we are living in colonial times!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sachingupta787 @rohini_sgh #RIP #andhbhakthi! Hope this man in the video doesn't get targetted bcoz they didn't get a volatile reaction (which the bhakts wait for and grab).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GargiRawat Watching @PrannoyRoyNDTV now, he says a small swing of 2.5% away from Biden is enough for Trump to win. I guess, too close to call! #ElectionsWithNDTV #ElectionDay #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@srobbins2188 @meiselasb Hope everyone has a child like yours, who listens to his mother in this day and age! 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BDUTT Most of them are more worried about the violence that some are predicting. A friend in NY is not even bothered who wins but is about what may follow.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Suraajkumar5 @Imvk50 @sameervats3 @Shewants_me_raw @SanjayNaxal6093 @imVkohli @RCBTweets But the problem with Rohit is, he's not consistent in Tests, he's barely hangging on.

Kohli has scored runs on all tracks, example the last England tour where the ball was swinging all over the place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abhisar_sharma @rohini_sgh Agreed! And actions of a few so called Muslims gives a chance for their haters to target the entire Muslim community.

<|startoftext|>@anubhavsinha You are right Sir. And they portray the actions of a handful of Muslims to target the entire community.

<|startoftext|>@rohini_sgh It is wrong if #CharlieHebdo is biased with his cartoons. However, that doesn't mean we can start killing whoever supports that.

<|startoftext|>@RohanRa81586153 @SreenivasanJain @IndiaToday Defamation? Check out the no.of cases against kela republic. Cheap journalism, just by shouting and targeting people he thinks he's a journo. This TRP scam has exposed him big time. Check out the no.of views NDTV gets on youtube vs kela republic. Kela's lies are exposed big time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shreelee2 @SreenivasanJain Hope you ponder about the propaganda of kela republic also. CBI, NCB come under Amit Shah and still kela republic is going on and on about SSR for what? I'll tell you, for TRP. Where is the moral stance there, like you said without docs or proof kela keeps jumping like a monkey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VanniadiPandya @SreenivasanJain No, wasn't watching. Do you know something called as trending? So Republic was putting out tweet after tweet, and every tweet was about the same thing. That's how I got to know. Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#fridaymorning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BDUTT @chetan_bhagat @themojo_in Absolutely nailed it! And this Gov't wants such youth so that their propaganda continues. Like they say,  it takes 2 hands to clap!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MrsGandhi @LavanyaBallal The truth is that the girl was murdered and she was found naked by her mother. The truth is that she confessed before she died about rape. If you are not familiar with the new rape laws after Nirbhaya, please read them. (1/2)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@yadudewhatever Agreed!  बेटी बचाओ - Save them if you can from my men. That's what the original message by the supreme leader meant, we didn't interpret it the right way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cow__Momma Did he say that? I mean did he compare to UP and Bihar? How dumb if he did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Idazaa2 Don't be surprised!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yadudewhatever Shameless Gov't and the pro rapists.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HibaBeg Yup, like they will allow us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BDUTT Good work @BDUTT. This interview was important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BDUTT @mcborwankar @vikramsingh112 @PlainPolicing That image of the #Hathras victim lying on the floor and narrating to the local journos was too much for me. I stopped watching at that point. I salute you @BDUTT to brave all these emotions to show us the truth. 🙏🙏🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yadudewhatever Done, i observed 2 mins for @KanganaTeam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sanket And the way the victims family was locked up and not allowed to meet anyone who wanted to help them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SketchingSwan @sanket I am sure journos like @sanket will keep journalism and truth alive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@balaji_v_iyer @sanket Yes, any true human will not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dilliwaalli @sanket True!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yadudewhatever What plot??? International that too, and against UP, wow. ये वाला PJ तो @kunalkamra88 और @RoflGandhi_ को भी पीछे छोड़ दिया.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rohini_sgh Just one answer to all your questions - "UP Police".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Namra9496 @ShekharGupta Major Requirement - I have taken part in protests favoring the rapists, against the rape victims.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Idazaa2 @ShekharGupta Yes, and there are several cases against Yogi. He is an expert in plotting these things, he has good criminal experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BDUTT Absolutely! How long can any dog bark?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yadudewhatever OMG! Not only selfish, cheap and shameless also!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yadudewhatever They are equal to rapists, so I'll call them Rapist.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RichaChadha @rohini_sgh Please boycott all the ACs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cow__Momma Not as a farmer, bcoz she acts in multiple roles and chooses what suits her best according to the situation. I saw her last defending Jaya Bachchan after Ravi Kishan had attacked Bollywood in Lok Sabha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justdoi75401867 @ShkNidhi @parthpunter @RahulGandhi Exactly! Why was only Nirbhaya case highlighted? Because that's how law works, not every case gets highlighted, but the one which does makes the difference for all others. And what can u say about blind followers, they didn't find such excuses during Nirbhaya, now they are. Shame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cow__Momma Yes, I can imagine!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bstvlive @rohini_sgh Outraged to see these images. How can the policemen who did this sleep peacefully. 🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Outraged to see these images. How can the policemen who did this sleep peacefully. 🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rohini_sgh @IsmatAraa Everyone knew that the Gov't was bullshiting, but the blind followers were looking for excuses. This report shuts them up. Thanks @rohini_sgh!

<|startoftext|>@BDUTT @ReallySwara @themojo_in No doubt, he should go! Imagine if something of this sort had happened during UPA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BDUTT @ReallySwara @themojo_in What is this debate about first or last, unbelievable. Rape is rape! Whether it's bloody one or 100 in any state. How shameless some people are? How can they point out at such numbers just for the sake of excuses. God save us! 🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BDUTT @themojo_in @virsanghvi @Radrama @shantanug_ @abhasinghlawyer I saw this, I just have one request, please don't get RW folks on ur talk shows if u can, they absolutely spoil the debate. I know u want everyone's prespective, but theirs has been the same always. Like that man Shantanu was arguing that rape cases in UP are less, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BDUTT @themojo_in You are seriously mad! Day in and out you strive!! 🙏🙏🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BDUTT @nowme_datta I don't think! Their TRP drama trumps everything else. I think the TV news channels are forced to cover this because of the outrage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BDUTT @kunaladdvant Absolutely! You are a star on any platform.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BDUTT @JamesTaneti Thanks! But memy "Thanks" won't justify the kind of risks you take and the way you stand up against the wrong and for the right. God bless you! Stay safe!! Take care!!! 🙏🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anishgawande @Cow__Momma Unwanted worldwide attention! Such shame!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdityaMenon22 Yes, you cannot question a state which is governed by the BJP. @Cow__Momma<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElmaGoldwyn @Cow__Momma Agree!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cow__Momma @its_choco_girl I really don't have the strength to deal with this anymore. I feel sick and tired. We surely are becoming a Banana Republic, if not already. 🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cow__Momma Some are and some don't want to question or just want to ignore. My whatsapp status always gets targetted by own good friends who support the RW. They are very good with me but how can I be selfish when so many innocents get targetted, my conscience doesn't allow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arvindgunasekar @rohini_sgh @GargiRawat @TanushreePande You all, please stay safe. God bless! 🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@factualdata1 @Cow__Momma Bcoz their true face is out now, we have seen at least since the lockdown how they have treated the poor and the LCs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@factualdata1 @Cow__Momma But what is the core vote bank of the RW?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@factualdata1 @Cow__Momma Remember Bihar is coming up. UC votes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CenteredAgnost @Cow__Momma I strongly believe now that this drama is being played out for the Bihar elections. UC votes matter a lot for them in both states and this is may be to show that come what may, they won't budge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShubhangiAhuja3 @Cow__Momma Also, may be they are using this to divert attention and some other game is being planned elsewhere. Which is usually the case with this Gov't. Don't forget Bihar elections and they may also use this to gain UC votes there. Same kind of politics works in Bihar and UP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drshamamohd @Cow__Momma @RahulGandhi @priyankagandhi Please also mention @derekobrienmp and numerous journalists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tw_araj @Cow__Momma Crazy world, we won't realize until we suffer the same thing. Hope this doesn't bite them but in this chaos, who knows. 🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CenteredAgnost @Cow__Momma they need to realize soon or nothing will be left to realize anyways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cow__Momma Yes, some are already distancing themselves. Hope everyone realize that no political party will stand up for us until we don't. Unless they want to be blind followers who will try to justify any and every act of their fake heroes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rehmanology The two words that came out of his mouth "Hey Ram" when he was shot is enough for me to cry for eternity. I just can't forget that visual, gives me goosebumps even today. Evergreen Gandhi! #MahatmaGandhi cannot be forgotten! #gandhijayanthi2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Cow__Momma If someone is sick they can be treated, but we are not dealing with humans here. This is inhuman/barbaric to say the least.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cow__Momma Iwas watching Barkha's Mojo Story and she was also reporting about UC gatherings and how they are trying to spread unwanted rumours to divert attention from the gruesome rape. And how they were trying to kind of justify the killing by naming it honour killing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fayedsouza lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaeyeB @Cow__Momma 👏👏👏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Winkerbell_ @Cow__Momma They need to behave like humans, then only will they be able to understand all this. I think you are expecting too much! lol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>With the fear of the UC ditching them, this Gov't is acting foolishly. But they fail to understand that a substantial number of UC guys don't support them anyways. @sanket @AdityaMenon22 @fayedsouza @kunalkamra88 @rehmanology @TheDeshBhakt @SreenivasanJain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yadudewhatever You're saying punishment in one sec. I assume u mean, the laws should be made so strong that justice can be delivered quickly. And u r right, they won't, with the fear of the UC ditching them. But they fail to understand that a substantial# of UC people don't support them anyways<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I keep getting asked by RW supporting friends mostly on WhatsappUniversity - What I did during UPA? I have protested then too,like Anna(मेरा c कटा इसमे),Nirbhaya.But they don't expect me to behave the same way with this Gov't. Is this called multiple personality disorder or what?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@alwaysshiva4u @ndtv @narendramodi Oh, you are expecting too much!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Saumandloi @vishalgoswami7 @ndtv It does make a difference. If all politicians rally around actual causes it will get the attention required.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Idazaa2 @rahulkanwal True! Media has set a dangerous trend, and not to forget some of our courts which have become mouth pieces of this Gov't.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rohini_sgh Just can't imagine how they could do this to that poor girl. The way her mum was sobbing to just see her and feel her one last time was heart breaking. Police in this country have lost all credibility. It's so hard for any victim to approach them after this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShreeShetty8 @yadudewhatever Are they even worth mentioning? When I saw Ravish's prime time show last night, i could feel the pain in his voice and automatically tears rolled for me.

<|startoftext|>@frillfaze 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ra84707262 @sohitmishra99 @ranvijaylive Did you question why the police cremated her so hurriedly? Without even letting her family touch the body. Shame!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sanket That's the point, they raped and killed her to show them their place. How is this even acceptable? Just bcoz she's dalit, they did this, they wouldn't have done this if she wasn't a dalit.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheDeshBhakt I hope their conscience wakes up at least now. Even animals cry out in pain, we are humans and we are supposed to cry and help and feel the pain of fellow humans.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheDeshBhakt It is so heartbreaking to not see your child even once before being cremated. How cruel? And what's happened to our police force?

<|startoftext|>@sanket @ndtv The problem with this Gov't is, they don't consult or clear apprehensions of the people. They just go ahead with what they think is right, like a dictator.

<|startoftext|>@sanket @free_thinker Agree with @free_thinker, this comparison is incorrect. Rhea has been framed, whereas Kangana has been instigating and wants the Maha Gov't to take any kind of action so that she can play the victim card. Rhea does not have political motives, whereas Kangana does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sanket Did the Maha Gov't ask you to focus on this rather than the COVID situation in Maha? No, they did not. On the other hand, Kangana is doing this to attract attention so that the media can be kept busy in such nonsense. You must follow Ravish's example, how he avoids all this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BDUTT u r an expert @BDUTT! you've been reporting for ages now. So true in ur observation like always. i agree with u completely! 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SreenivasanJain all their elections have been, just that with each election their fascist standards touch a new benchmark. I won't be surprised if the next one will overtake this one. Just wait and watch! 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nidhi What you say is true, but what @kunalkamra88  did was also the truth 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fayedsouza buddha prakat hua 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shehla_Rashid I don't agree, we've had roles like what Sanjay Dutt did in Shootout at Lokhandwala.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fayedsouza @sidin u guys know better, but for those who read.. that's how India has always been, we accepted good ideas in every field and rejected the bad ones. Proud of my country!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fayedsouza Why don't they think of diversity and inclusion. You are right, why no women representation?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GAUAHAR_KHAN This video exactly explains what happens, it's not about who apologized to whom, even Sidharth apologized, and everyone knows both Asim and Sidharth don't mean it. Problem is Asim gaining sympathy for something he also does. He tries to make an issue out of it, which he shouldn't<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nidhi @anand_arni people are asking if the Governor will resign on moral grounds. are there any morals anymore?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vijaita @Nidhi yeah 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WahModiGWah @AisiTaisiDemo 😂✌️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BDUTT LOL!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bainjal Have you ever seen anyone meditating with their specs on? 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nidhi Yes! Never ever thought a terror accused (whose vehicle was used in the blast) will run for elections in India! #BJPsupportsterrorists<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bainjal @BDUTT Never ever thought a terror accused (whose vehicle was used in the bomb blast) will be allowed to run for elections. Shame! #BJPsupportsterrorists<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BDUTT Like mom is the daughter! God bless you! Keep up the good work and your mom's legacy! 👍✌👌👏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kunalkamra88 Like we say in Bangalore, NASA "gand mein laath marega" for this kind of crap. 😂🤣😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LOLrakshak @kunalkamra88 There are loads in Bangalore as well! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kunalkamra88 did this teacher learn yoga by watching modi's yoga?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SreenivasanJain oh shit, they are trying to kill him 🤣🙏 please God save me from bullshit 🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nidhi #Yeti ji! LOL! 😂🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thevirdas LOL! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dhruv_rathee I agree to what u r trying to communicate. But why bring #parrikar's name when he is not there to defend for himself. Try to avoid such controversial statements. God bless you, otherwise u r doing a wonderful wonderful job! 👍🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aarti01375306 @kunalkamra88 @dhruv_rathee @zoo_bear 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kunalkamra88 LOL! u r hilarious with your one liners. 🤣🤣🤣👍✌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WaliYale Epic! 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kunalkamra88 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kunalkamra88 @ArnabGoswamiRtv hope u understood! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>what Ashwin did was indeed against the spirit of cricket. Imagine this happening in a world cup final or so, it will just ruin the game. Shame that you are trying to defend something which cricketing greats never approved off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bhogleharsha the point is, if u look at butler he was never running before the ball was delivered. In fact he stopped and checked why the ball wasn't delivered. In 100 plus years of cricketing history, it's natural for any batsmen to take a step when the ball is being delivered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, the strongest possible candidate must be fielded, the only thing that should prevent such a candidate from contesting is, if the person has a criminal back ground. Thanks for your time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The ones who did not get the ticket, were they from the same constituency as the Begum? If they were not, then the fielding of that Begum from her consistency is a very good political move. It's all about fielding your strongest candidate, one who is able to win the seat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Javedakhtarjadu Assalam Walaikum, Akhtar Saab, wanted to check with you about your reference to the 1952 Indian elections. The names you took of guys who did not get the ticket, and then names of a Begum and Maulana Azad who got. (continued in the following tweet)...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ravishndtv Sir, why don't you tweet? Please do Sir, at least through you, we can read something of worth. Thanks! God bless you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fayedsouza houdu, Yeddy yawaglu tamashe maad tharey 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BDUTT ur mother is still alive in the form of @BDUTT, u r making her proud, and u r serving the society in the best of forms because u speak the truth. God bless!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Saba1121 #NewZealandShooting #NewZealandMosqueShooting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Saba1121 1.8 billion Muslims around the globe, and may be 0. some percent off them may be associated with terrorism. The Senator with such irresponsible statement has included the remaining 99% off the 1.8 billion Muslims. People like this Senator spread hatred among communities. Shame!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bhupendrachaube I thought u r a neutral journo but my assumption was wrong. I have stopped following u from today on. Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReallySwara @RahulGandhi Looks like Rahul is more popular down South than in the North. Pray to God that he succeeds!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kunalkamra88 damn funny bro, amazing! 😆👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BDUTT God bless, stay strong. u r the voice of the masses, we need u more now than anytime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SreenivasanJain no doubt, we in Bangalore keep checking the ndtv app for any other drama that may have started. It's hell these days, just hope the elections are done with ASAP!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShekharGupta u first cancel the original procurement deal and delay the process, and then u give it to someone who was useless and risk the country's defense. and now u say if we had it we could have used it. i thought Modi was smarter than what he has unknowingly admitted. Slow claps guys!👏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rahulkanwal u first cancel the original procurement deal and delay the process, and then u give it to someone who was useless and risk the country's defense. and now u say if we had it we could have used it. i thought Modi was smarter than what he has unknowingly admitted.

<|startoftext|>@Shehla_Rashid whoever was doing that are shameless no doubt, i think they gave up on you. They may well give up, as you are solid as a rock. God bless!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SreenivasanJain What s shame! Can't believe, BJP can stoop to such cheap levels by politicizing the pulwama attack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SreenivasanJain Look beautiful! 👌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BDUTT @deepsealioness Thank you barkha! 🙏<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BDUTT @Twitter i know it's tough for you Barkha, but India really needs a journalist of your stature, more so now. Please continue your good work, God bless! 🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BDUTT @IPSMadhurVerma @MPPoliceOnline pls stay strong and safe barkha, i can understand u must be under enormous pressure, but we all need you. God bless!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BDUTT don't react to them, not worth it, u pls continue with ur amazing work as a journalist. True Indians will always love you! Jai Hind! 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kunalkamra88 of course @karanjohar makes a lot of sense in his talk shows, just that people can't digest reality. Pls don't even compare him with rumor mongers like @ArnabGoswamiRtv 🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SreenivasanJain now @ArnabGoswamiRtv is acting like a gali ka or sadak chaap journlaist who can go to any extent to please his boss with any story that attracts rumor mongers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the_hindu @nramind All the bhakts pls bycott @the_hindu, bcoz u guys won't understand! 😂 @kunalkamra88<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nidhi Mr. Patel @bharat546 have you seen the movie KGF? Famous dialogue from that movie "kya chahiye re tereko?" 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SreenivasanJain They have claimed anything and everything 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShekharGupta Gupta ji - u r always neutral, don't listen to #Bhakts, just ignore the #RW, no use breaking ur head about them. We love the way u work, u have inspired a whole generation of journalists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tavleen_singh Guys pls maintain decorum, pls don't use foul language or this sati savitri govt. will take this as an opportunity to highlight that not only the #RW all use it. We can't stoop down to their levels 🙏 @ShekharGupta<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@umeshchander4 Sorry to hear Sir. May God give you all the patience in this time of grief.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kunalkamra88 how dare you talk on my show 😂 this is my show 🤣 i don't mind going to jail 😂🤣 that will be a reality now i guess. 😆🤣😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shehla_Rashid can't believe central ministers want to show off like this. Shame! What are they thinking? in this day and age with techies every where, they will be caught red handed. still they got the balls to try. Wow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kunalkamra88 haha.. and he will be protected by BJP like he's a saint. Example: Mukul Roy, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jomalhotra shame on @ArnabGoswamiRtv, at least now he should take heed and work as a neutral journalist rather than favouring one party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kunalkamra88 @Shehla_Rashid oh no! phir tho toothpaste ka ad ban karna chahiye, how dare they speak facts. 🤣😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shunalishroff @BDUTT happy #BasantPanchami guys, don't get disheartened by trolls. God bless! 😀🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BDUTT why will u shed a tear @BDUTT, he's not worth it. lets preserve our tears for those who have done something of note, like a poor mother raising her kids even when she's got nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GargiRawat @khanumarfa don't force anyone to wear, but if the girl wants to, then why force her to not wear? my mum or wife or sis don't wear but that doesn't mean i go around asking all women to stop wearing it. It's their choice🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khanumarfa What is your problem if she decides to wear it, is she asking you to wear one? No right? Do your thing and let her do her thing. Don't be an attention seeker! Its her choice! my mum doesn't wear, wife doesn't, but they respect choice of another lady, pls do the same. Thanks! 🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sardesairajdeep nope! @SirPareshRawal and the #RW don't go by facts. u don't have to react to cheap taunts @sardesairajdeep<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SreenivasanJain in 2019, like the opposition, if BJP wants to come back to power it has to be a mahagathbandan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bhupendrachaube Can we really believe the top govt source? #RafaleScam #rafalepolitics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShekharGupta why haven't u asked questions like, why the deal was taken from HAL and given to Ambani? r u afraid of backlash from the govt? #RafaleScam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rupasubramanya @the_hindu i don't think @nramind will mind it, he's seen it all, don't worry 😉 #RafaleScam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@milindkhandekar @manupanwar 🤣👌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bainjal @RahulGandhi u bet, he and #RW are panicking bcoz of @RahulGandhi and now #PriyankaGandhiVadra #RafaleScam #ChowkidarChorHai<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SreenivasanJain for bhakts everything is propaganda man @SreenivasanJain, the rant against #RaGa is justified but anything against the #Chowkidar will be termed as hate, bigoted, etc. etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kunalkamra88 @vivekagnihotri @RahulGandhi for bhakts its pole not poll 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SreenivasanJain Of course @bhupendrachaube is kidding or just being sarcastic! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kunalkamra88 nothing bro, i don't think so much. I smoke up and chill out, help people here and there with some cash, etc. Bhakts are there to entertain us, what's conventional for them is anyways unconventional for us. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nidhi Congrats and God bless!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Nidhi @bsindia What else do u expect, when the GDP growth rate keeps changing like the rate of chicken everyday, this is nothing compared to that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nishantpant_in @Nidhi @bsindia 👍😂👌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SreenivasanJain @Nidhi NDTV is the most neutral and best news channel in the country. Well done guys!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rangwalla_iqbal @FactCheckIndia Aameen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BDUTT u shouldn't be surprised @BDUTT, only @ArnabGoswamiRtv is allowed to run news channels, bcoz he is the best! (Try not to laugh) 🤣😆😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RanaAyyub but if u guys disengage, what's the point, this is exactly what the sanghis want. Pls stay, be strong and most importantly ethical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>they don't get much credit now a days, looks like d "Calypso Kings" are back. Please stand up for these amazing cricketers, who don't even get paid most of d time.

<|startoftext|>@jigneshmevani80 shame! the govt. should remove all the subsidies given to religious piligrimages, start with Hajj. and we have enough sculptures in the country, this 3k cr could have been used to improve govt. medical centers across India. @Nidhi @BDUTT @sardesairajdeep @ShekharGupta @RanaAyyub<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nidhi Ofcourse gamechanger, at least she's not involved in linchings, killings, murders, etc. like some of the current party presidents and PMs. corrupt, is everyone in India, including the people involved in the Rafael deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nidhi glad she did, however women r treated in India. The fact is, when a woman speaks or stands up, everyone look up and listen. Same with you @Nidhi and @BDUTT and @SushmaSwaraj  etc. etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kabhi_Kabhie @vikramsampath @Nidhi @kanhaiyakumar that's why "usually" i said. LOL!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BDUTT @imVkohli @sardesairajdeep @ShekharGupta @RanaAyyub pls help by retweeting this, millions of ur followers will learn, how dangerous it is to use such skin lightening products. Thanks!🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShekharGupta Well said, the bureaucat of India is hand in glove with the politician. Had they stood firm, the politicians would not have made such ugly strides, and we have seen good examples in the past.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShekharGupta absolutely! This is #destructionofindiancricket, there's no other adjective to describe this. What a mess, only degrees don't change anyone, u got to be open minded as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imVkohli God bless you guys! u bring joy and happiness on the faces of millions around the world especially India. Stay calm, stay blessed! @AnushkaSharma<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BDUTT @washingtonpost absolutely barkha, where are the jobs? the current government thinks, we are as foolish as they are! 🤣 thank you for being brave and carrying on with your amazing never give up attitude. Salute you, God bless!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RanaAyyub Dr. Singh is a Statesman in the league of Dr. Kalam. And Dr. Singh doesn't mind it either, he knows it's a joke and he did mock them by saying "I was accidental FM as well".

<|startoftext|>@ShekharGupta That's true Sir, he is a Statesman in the league of Dr. Kalam.

<|startoftext|>@ShekharGupta @_YogendraYadav As an Indian Muslim, I am least bothered about what happens with outsiders, as i don't feel safe talking about other Muslim countries right now, and when this govt. is in power.

<|startoftext|>@Nidhi Don't know what people get by posting vicious comments, or may be they r jobless and of course the bhakts. @Nidhi u pls continue ur good work, fools will continue to live, these people have no human values, can't expect much from them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ShekharGupta excuse me Sir, he has already clarified &amp; that's why filed a case against the removal. Why should he resign, the law should take it's course, pls don't be a diplomat when it comes to talking about the govt. I can understand people r afraid to talk, but u should at least not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imVkohli Happy New Year, may God bless you with good health and prosperity! 👐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imVkohli nice to have a personalized app. Thanks for keeping us updated and in ur mind always. God bless!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShekharGupta Absolutely! How many ever runs batsmen score, we need quality bowlers to take wickets and win matches. The current fab 5 should always be treated in the same league as the former fab 5, because bowlers don't always get the due credit or attention they deserve.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@klrahul11 bro, your time is running out. You are such a wonderful player and it would be heartbreaking for ur fans like me to see you fail again and again. Can't you just leave everything outside the off stump, unless it is short. Play straight and be decisive, God bless!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShekharGupta It's all about how one's character is. If @imVkohli is aggressive, he will follow his instincts which is good and doesn't have to change for anyone. I remember @SGanguly99 was also targeted when he started off. Later he was appreciated for being what he was.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sardesairajdeep absolutely!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>absolutely👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imVkohli u need to come out of ur shell if u want to improve. i mean u could have slog swept the ball instead of pulling to samuel's. he bowls like a slow medium bowler, when will u start sweeping, paddling, etc.<|endoftext|>
