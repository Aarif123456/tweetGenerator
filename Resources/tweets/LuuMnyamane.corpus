<|startoftext|>@Anele We went and i sat in the car looking at the lightning for about 45 minutes. I was never afraid of lightning ever again after that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anele I realised that i was actually afraid of thunder because my mom is afraid of thunder and she inherited the fear from my grandmothe so during one thunderstorm i asked my baby daddy to drive me to the veld where the were no houses or trees to face my fears.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anele Yhuuu. I was terrified of thunder to the extent where i would hide in the closet when there was a thunder storm then i fell pregnant and i knew that shit had to come to an end. I didn't want my baby to live his life like that....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MasekoValencia To anybody. Stop looking down on people and treat every person with respect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MasentleSiwela Been thinking about it, im so nervous to start honestly. 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Macc_Rosay Most definitely could. Consistency, patience and protective styling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MasentleSiwela I determined my hair type by how tight my kinks are when my hair is freshly washed. I found that hair type has nothing to do with how coarse or fine the hair is its about your curl/kink pattern.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HappyNthaby I use a lot of different products, im always trying new products to determine which are best for my hair but my current faves are aunt jeckies knot on my watch detangler, loreal elvive extraordinary oil conditioner and native child shea butter cream as a sealant. #GirlTalkZA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HappyNthaby Mine too from postpartum shedding but gentle oil massages and styling my hair loosely helps a lot. A suffering hairline needs some tender care babe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crusty AF but thought id share some 4c inspo, im moisturising my hair and putting it in jumbo twists for the week. Im already done with one side...Look at that definition though😍 thats the defined twistout i needed the past weekend. 😒 #GirlTalkZA #naturalhair #4chair  https://t.co/wqNHE1YXQV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissNomaM No we dont, someone said to me i must be tswana cos tswana girls are gorgeous others assume im coloured and actually ke mosotho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@refilweethipe Le nna hle❤️❤️❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TselengJacqy My hair is mostly in twists, I strictly finger detangle, no blow drying cos heat damages hair. Use the LOC method to moisturise that means i use Luquid, Oil then Cream. I wash my hair twice a month nd i'll share more about the products i used for my wash day soon. #GirlTalkZA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@starr_phila There ain't no difinition🙁 but thank you. 💛<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The twistout wont let me be cute. Im defeated. #TwistoutFail #4chair #GirlTalkZA  https://t.co/JTSlVjYz3t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tough in the moment but the result is &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Celebrate yourself more often, if no one is planning to throw you a birthday dinner, host it yourself and invite others. No one planning a baby shower for you...host it yourself and invite those close to you. Celebrate yourself, you deserve it. I DESERVE IT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember beyond fear is freedom so keep going no matter how scary the dream may be the end result will definitely be worth it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wow...this thread just made me emotional AF but anyway let me start my day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I pray that all who suffer from mental health find relieve and peace one day. Love and light to you all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My point is I no longer have anxiety attacks daily, im much lighter and more excited about my future than i am haunted by my past.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And always try not to focus on the lifetime of milestones we couldn't share. This is still very hard to do but i try, i will always try.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most of that pain was from the loss my child, i started to celebrate the time i had with him during the pregnancy...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The mind is very powerful...I let go of the pain and started to focus on positive affirmation and appreciating what i already have<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What relieved most of my anxiety was just focusing on my own journey and stopping focusing how far others are in their lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even if its from family, i don't tolerate it because i've realised that i should make my joy and well being a priority.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And started doing things that brought me joy daily and i focus on bettering my life and myself daily. I remove myself from negativity....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Kabelo_Moagi Yes, that's what the department recommends but I didn't fail maths I just got less than what was required to register for a certain degree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kabelo_Moagi Worst thing is that tertiary institutions wont let you in with the separate certificate so your actually just wasting your money and time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kabelo_Moagi I remember I had R800 but I cant remember whether it was for registration or for the subject.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Feeling so guilty for eating take-aways and drinking this weekend, gonna put in an extra hour tomorrow at gym to make myself feel better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kabelo_Moagi After the 3yrs has passed they cant combine/include the new results on your NSC. So you'll get a separate certificate for that subject.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kabelo_Moagi Was gonna do it through jeppe college but I found out that you there's a cut off at 3yrs.<|endoftext|>
