<|startoftext|>@Craig_A_Spencer When I had one of my open heart surgeries loved my Dr. but the nurse who gave me my first bath was the most amazing woman. She was so kind I even broke down (very drugged) &amp; told her all about my family drama. She was my best friend in the world for that 20 min bath.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AOC @DanCrenshawTX It’s equivalent to being kicked in the chest by a donkey. Other people have fucking problems too. Yes he went into the military great....thank you but that doesn’t make you a better than  me &amp; your injuries do not make you more important.<|endoftext|>

He was young, owned his own mortuary &amp; well let’s just say was the most eligible bachelor in town. He chose my mom with 2 kids.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timodc Would look so bad. People dying, families going hungry &amp; losing their jobs. 🙄 people need to stop with the silliness. Yea it would be sooo entertaining &amp; feel good, but just energize his already crazy base. We need to stop giving him the attention he craves.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@obrienwriter @CapehartJ Ahhh right. I don’t know why I just assumed Nixon had been charged. Jeez that just seems so so slimy &amp; I cannot believe that exists. Well just the blanket pardon. I have no problem with them for obvious deserving people. (Not most of trumps)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yashar She’d probably say no thanks. She’s doing just fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CapehartJ How can he pardon himself without a charge? No one attack me!! I’m seriously just asking how that would work? You can’t just blanket pardon? I mean “hey this is just in case one day I get in trouble” I mean it’s not a raincheck. Or do I not understand pardons?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pwaites I’m so sorry. It’s the hardest decision I’ve made this year. I was right there with you. Woken up every 30-45 minutes because he needed something.

<|startoftext|>@yashar I grew up in a funeral home &amp; was never shielded from it. I used to sit in the embalming room &amp; chat with my parents while they worked. I’ve also have had 5 open heart surgeries which started at 3 months old so yea shielding me from horrors of the world just wasn’t possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yashar Honestly anything that covers more of trump up is better<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TVietor08 @MattGertz Trumps Twitter feed is insanity 😂 What he’s really doing though is gearing up to have his own network and screw over Fox. How do these people not see that he’s only nice to you if you’re 💯 loyal to him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@quiEtBliss_ @ZatotheG @anti_hackers2 @realDonaldTrump Absolutely! It’s insanity!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@yashar I meet with my heart surgeon Thursday &amp; if he says it’s safe for me I’m allllll in. I don’t think he’ll have any problem with me taking it, but given my extensive heart condition I just want to hear it from him as well as fauci.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertMaguire_ Same<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@svdate Shouldn’t it be public knowledge what’s going on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well well well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Loire1 @GovSisolak Did you forget the man he served under for 8 years has 125m followers roughly 38M more than trump. Oh and also about 22% of US adults use Twitter. It’s not a freaking gauge in popularity to majority of the country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCrenshawTX Hey Dan did you ever come out and talk about how shitty the Boogaloo boys are for setting a fire at a police precinct? Or do you save your finger wagging for when it’s the left that does something bad?  https://t.co/jL3V0qq0dv<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lyndseyfifield @JonLemire No he will not. You’re obviously a very misinformed person.  He will absolutely give trumps admin credit for it. He’s not a pathetic ego hungry maniac like trump 🤷🏻‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonLemire lol what if it’s ready just in time for Biden to distribute.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_IeshaNicole So damn sweet!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrumpWarRoom In the pre-industrial western United States, 86 proof whiskey was considered to be the equivalent of a wine spritzer or 3.2 beer. If a bartender 86′ed you, you were essentially cut off. In modern terminology it means to shut down anyone who’s being an asshole.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar If there was a plot against Republicans like the one against Whitmer we would never hear the end of it and they would be calling for every Democrat in the country to “tone it down” &amp; answer for the perps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More of this everywhere.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany @jack Let’s say your little girl is in daycare &amp; she bites another kid &amp; they remove her because it’s against the rules &amp; can hurt others.

<|startoftext|>@ThatEricAlper That’s the sequel to breath of the wild<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TVietor08 These assholes who have had it are so selfish thinking they’re so tough because it didn’t kill them. It’s different for everyone &amp; of course we should all be scared of it. I personally am with major pre-existing conditions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar lol. That question made him so mad. Also they better disinfect that railing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maureendowd #ETTD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump This is so irresponsible telling people not to fear a deadly virus. You’re the worst person to ever lead this country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yashar I want to know if her baby has it :/. I really hope not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politico Hope her baby tests negative<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustTomEdwards We need to get back to talking about all of his failures since from the horses mouth he’s fine 🤷🏻‍♀️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@juliaioffe Yes I do have a heart condition but I really didn’t think it was my heart or that I was THAT sick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juliaioffe I signed a ton of papers &amp; stood at the front desk of the ER drinking ginger ale thinking I was just dehydrated. My heart rate was 167 &amp; I was about to go into cardiac arrest. They shocked me twice &amp; now I have an implanted defibrillator.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jonfavs Ughhhhh here we go with the new tone now he gets it crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timodc What the actual fuck!  He’s the most selfish person on the planet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timodc I almost died hours after one of my operations &amp; They leveled with me &amp; told me they screwed up &amp; didn’t give me a second chest tube thinking I didn’t need it. So had to do it while I was awake. At no time did they sugar coat a thing to “uplift” me. They prepared me for the worst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProjectLincoln @JasonMillerinDC 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yashar Cult<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samstein Pathetic he just let him ramble all that crap &amp; no push back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonostrower @AP Who named them “virus outbreak trump” 😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soledadobrien He seems like he’s going to break down &amp; cry!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonfavs FFS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislhayes I’ve been surrounded by doctors my whole life. I’ve had five open-heart surgeries some really great doctors some really shitty doctors and they’ve never gotten info to me about my diagnosis or procedures wrong. I’m not the president. You don’t get that shit wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BullyMaus @TVietor08 I’m still nervous for Biden he’ll take another test I’m sure in a few days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TVietor08 If Trump were feeling well he would be sitting there watching TV tweeting about how great he feels and how stupid everyone else is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanaBashCNN Why do people even need to be in there?  They don’t need a freaking crowd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveCArmada @chrislhayes Yep!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislhayes If that press conference had been held concerning Biden or any Democratic president or nominee Republicans would be demanding them come outside and do cartwheels to prove that they weren’t dying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatEricAlper 6 feet under<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kaitlancollins Nor following health professionals has consequences<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anneapplebaum @jaketapper 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clairecmc Yep &amp; The same people are saying Biden needs to delay the election or if he were a gentleman he would do blah blah blah. Give Me a freaking break if the roles were reversed Trump would be dancing on Biden’s potential grave!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlyssaMastro44 I fell for the Trump campaign trying to get donations off of his covid diagnosis because WHY wouldn’t the same campaign that put out an email talking about September 31st beg for money for an infected president. 😅😫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattHarringer @SenatorWicker @Delta They are so so so selfish!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattshuham Wait are they somehow insinuating that Democrats planted the virus at Trump super spreader garden event 🤔🤔🤔 these people are absolutely insane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid Where is this reporting from Chris Wallace I gotta see this before I repost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar He’s probably milking the sympathy so that his poll numbers go up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kenklippenstein Yep! And they’re going to ram her through while Democrats and the media are wishing them well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDweck My thoughts exactly!! McConnells tweeting about ramming through Barrett so we can move along &amp; talk about all the breaking news last night?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Booker4KY If it’s business as usual for them,  it’s business as usual for us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Booker4KY OK everyone McConnell says he’s feeling good so we can go back to talking about all of the fucked up shit Trump has done and his wife saying basically she didn’t give a fuck about the children at the border. 🤷🏻‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrbenwexler 100% he would and when he comes out of this he will mock him &amp; say he couldn’t handle it if he got it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brhodes 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar God they are so pathetic. Biden was probably scrambling this morning trying to get a test for themselves because of his irresponsible ass!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyceWhiteVance Seriously. His poll numbers are going to rise because he’s not saying a word and he’s not out on the trail and no one’s talking about every horrible thing he &amp; his wife have done just this week!!  the media for some reason think they can’t talk about his faults while he’s sick???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PopChassid @mehdirhasan Yea, fuck em.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BFriedmanDC This is the type of shit that concerns me about his test results. Everyone will feel bad for him &amp; coddle him. Screw that, we’re still in this mess because of him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So what I learned tonight the #abbottlab 15 min test is bullshit 🤷🏻‍♀️ #TrumpHasCovid #TrumpIsARacist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sbg1 Seems like distraction to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar Someone was holding a cheeseburger &amp; Diet Coke to get him to say this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Acosta We’ll see what kind of tweets he sends out  tomorrow. Also it doesn’t matter because he’s already given them what they need they know he doesn’t mean it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#waronchristmas #MelaniaTapes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KFILE Omg he tried to say China like his loser dad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You have hair plugs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RexChapman I’m so sick of him getting first second third chance to correct himself until he says something that mildly sounds normal what he said is what he said he’s a fucking racist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddale8 God he’s such a fucking liar. I just cannot take it anymore with him &amp; his enablers &amp; supporters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SRuhle @jmeacham @MSNBC Seriously. I’m sick of people putting this on biden too. Had he just stood there he would’ve been called a loser and weak. He held his tongue more than we will ever know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRickWilson 4 non blondes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty annoyed with people lumping Biden’s performance in with trumps as if they’re at all the same. 🙄 #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sambrichard @jonfavs That was wild! My boyfriend &amp; I jerked our heads to look at each other in shock at that turn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keithboykin There’s too many of them out there. That dude who just said on cnn that Biden calling trunp a clown was the most ridiculous part of the debate 😳😳😳😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danpfeiffer Already seeing the both sides about the screaming. Ridiculous<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast I love how they say if Trump did what Biden did it would be over he literally bragged about sexually assaulting women and it was not over 🤷🏻‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid Imagine having that big ole cute infectious laugh all the time. I bet life with him is a trip!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“I would honestly try to leave the country. And if that wasn’t an option, I would probably take my children and sit in the garage and turn my car on and it would be over.” @OzaukeeCounty you might want to have CPS pay a visit to this woman.  https://t.co/Ua9DBnJuUi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidJHarrisJr @realDonaldTrump Can’t even take this tweet seriously because the grammar is so bad.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@yashar Ughh I can’t stand crap like this spreading.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IlhanMN Omg he’s so obsessed with you. What a loser.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CapehartJ @NewDay I was kind of shocked he didn’t push back harder on cnn last night. Maybe he got yelled at so he came back to make dear leader happy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cmclymer I just bought them but scared people will just see Donald Trump &amp; think im a supporter. A serious fear of mine, I rarely even wear red. 🤣Hope the Biden logo is more pronounced in person. Either way I love it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TVietor08 Fuck this. I was born with 3 holes in my heart &amp; had open heart surgery at 3 months old, many more followed. I went years being denied insurance for anything heart related. How is that acceptable? ACA was literally a life saver.<|endoftext|>

It's the one place that we could go without feeling like, you know, it's the end of the world," she said, adding that she observed social distancing was taking place in the office<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProjectLincoln lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abbierenn @kittenhawk1 @MollyJongFast That’s 100% it. 45% of them could not name a single policy they just want to hurt other people &amp; watch them get upset about it on social media.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChadNoyes3 @samstein It’s disgusting Facebook does not immediately delete that shit. It’s such a terrible awful thing to accuse anyone of. You don’t just throw that term around. It’s sick &amp; I definitely blame social media<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChadNoyes3 @samstein My mom busted out with it the other day and I was just dumbfounded. I had no idea it had gotten to her &amp; of course because of Facebook. I don’t even recognize my parents anymore &amp; we do not speak.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wkamaubell They all knew it was coming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TVietor08 &amp; just added to the chart<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSarcasmShow Yup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clairecmc I feel like this will make the republicans voting for Biden go back to trump :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deray Just realized he knew this was coming since he trotted out picks the other day. We’re fucked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cmclymer Especially when two nights ago he stressed he would be the president for all people not just democrats. He’s just shattering the lie that Donald Trump claims to be for the “little guy” while shitting on golden toilets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatEricAlper Bowie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clairecmc Wtf!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CollinsforGA For telling the truth?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast I do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcmaron  https://t.co/j0lDgA31Ju<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peacelovinMimi Trump would never let this woman into his condos or country clubs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mistergeezy Remember when no one got mad for mocking the black man’s neck that was really big? Just sayin’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar 6 feet under<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShannonOConnor0  https://t.co/Xg4d4bKyao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CohenMarlynn @AndrewBatesNC @Women4Biden Yep!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid I was in a convenient store yesterday checking out &amp; this good ole boy was walking in without a mask. I was like great here we go! He got to the door looked at me in my mask &amp; ran back to his truck &amp; grabbed his mask. 🤣🤣. I was totally judging &amp; so glad he proved me wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Imagine being the president of the United States &amp; your biggest worry in the morning while taking a dump &amp; almost 200k are dead from a pandemic is what’s trending on Twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Steele is all of us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@travisakers 😭😭😭 so sweet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar This red blue state shit is such Fuckery!!!!! I can’t even imagine the outrage if a democratic president said this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stephanie_4312 @chrissyteigen She’s so damn adorable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZerlinaMaxwell I always wonder if these kinds of stories are distraction. I mean he knows his base doesn’t care if there are cases &amp; then the people get better &amp; claim it wasn’t so bad. Believe me I hate sounding like a conspiracy theorist but this freaking administration!  😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fitzgeraldbarth @IChotiner Oh no I know. There were other on the thread. Sorry didn’t realize i specifically commented to you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fitzgeraldbarth @IChotiner lol if you’re not in Texas you have no idea how important &amp; huge betos campaign was. The shittiest most unpopular republican is still a real tough opponent. This state is fucking red.  Funny when people make fun of his campaign. What he did for Texas Democrats was huge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid @Target Especially after seeing that video of all those kids in Florida having a party because they had all tested positive!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mehdirhasan 100%. It’s like softballs to him, no pushback &amp; he’s allowed to just dominate the conversation &amp; talk over the host. He’s going to make a shitshow out of the debates, obviously<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danielsgoldman Garbage humans brought to you by @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar Ohhh someone get a gif of him showing how the hand goes all around your face 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar Why don’t they push back on him!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therecount @JoyAnnReid God every reporter has to speak to him like a child.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSarcasmShow Omg can you imagine the acrobats republicans would do to condone that? I can 😖<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jsloggans3 100%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimOBrien How can so many not see-through this clown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast  https://t.co/tZvkGjuJrV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mehdirhasan Why would they even be in a position to have that procedure in custody? It’s a really tough surgery to recover from. There needs to be a lot more information about this because it’s truly horrific if true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The president of the United States retweeted a dumb video of old people that calls the Pennsylvania governors wife stupid. Great tone. #TrumpLiedAmericansDied #COVID19 #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace  https://t.co/n6uU3DbrN9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndivisibleTenn @emilyfavreau I saw this bumper sticker today 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyfavreau This is great! I’m so happy my neighborhood has In the last few days exploded with these. I’m in Austin Texas so not too surprising but still.  https://t.co/PLhcduJyEM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC @harrisonjaime Oooooh oooooh Make a video for trump now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TVietor08 This is why everyone needs to push back &amp; fact check him in real time. He’s such a fucking asshole. His flippant arrogant “I know you are but what am I” attitude Was so on display there. He cannot stand anyone else getting the last jab or word. It’s really terrifying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidbix Where’s the national guard for the people storming schools?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@regularcorrect @mviser Seriously what question can a reporter ask that’s going to open the eyes of millions??  Most of them just want to stir the pot. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthewamiller Feels like everyone’s gone absolutely fucking insane on the right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremynewberger Coughchella<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ilovemyjobpj @uptoncountry @danielsgoldman Yep :/. It’s impossible to get through to a lot of them. I’ve had to cut off my family.  They tell me all the bad things trump has done &amp; assign it to Biden.  It’s bizarre. When you say otherwise you’re told to wake up &amp; stop watching fake news 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricTrump @realDonaldTrump Wait so you’re saying she won because she put stickers on her car or she has talent?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thedailybeast Where’s the Q freaks on this?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WajahatAli Same, it’s one of the last places I want to be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yashar They’re the best! RIP my sweet girl who thought she was the size of a chihuahua:)  https://t.co/Kd2GQONX00<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OhNoSheTwitnt I’ll never understand this phrase. I mean you barely flick a ball &amp; men drop to the ground. 🤣🤣 it’s the dumbest phrase ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedcruz Ted Cruz doesn’t even have the balls to get off the evil twitter &amp; stick to parler like he cried about months ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamgreenbean @ceebubssure @methodicjon @TVietor08 I’m sorry, it’s so insane.  :(. Mine are threatening to leave the country if Biden wins!!!!! They’ve never traveled further than one state away so I 🙄🙄🙄🙄 at that &amp; honestly I wouldn’t care if they did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlesMBlow If Obama had not said “under god”as trump did not republicans would lose their goddamn minds!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast Why did she release them? I mean yea it shows what a two faced shit he is, but won’t this just backfire her releasing private messages? No one come for me I’m not defending Eric. Fuck all the trumps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@methodicjon @TVietor08 Also I’m sorry :(. It’s truly awful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@methodicjon @TVietor08 It really is. I was in shock hearing some of the shit coming out of their mouths. Crazy part is they’re totally COVID believers &amp; terrified of it, know people who have died yet still thinks Trumps the greatest president of their lifetime. I’m mortified having to say this 😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TVietor08 This is the type of shit that has fried my once cool as fuck parents brains. I can’t even reason with them &amp; ive just cut them off completely. I seriously feel like we live in two different worlds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slpng_giants @Twitter @jack It’s so weird seeing middle age/old men like him living their lives as twitter trolls? How embarrassing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therecount Omg he didn’t say the word god!!!!! Where are the pearl clutchers!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anything trump says today about 9/11 will be a lie. This is who he is.  No shock or sadness in his voice, just glee.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyceWhiteVance Are people still signing waivers they won’t sue if his ego rally kills them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TVietor08 I wonder if he’ll show us that clip about trunp bragging about having the tallest building.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonLemire Garbage trump supporting humans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samstein God he’s disgusting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kokomothegreat O m g<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>lol love her<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TVietor08 God it’s all so exhausting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rebeccaballhaus lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast Same!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SRuhle @CristiLondono @MSNBC I’ve not been visited by a single candidate &amp; rarely see their ads &amp; ignore most of the texts &amp; I know everything they’re about because I’ve read their platforms?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SRuhle @CristiLondono @MSNBC Can’t they read Biden’s plans? I mean yes outreach but damn why can’t people see the Democratic Party did not nominate the “socialist”. I just can’t wrap my head around all the people all over the country that need to be coddled &amp; told everything that’s right in front of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is this not career ending.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealAndrew_ Texas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonfavs @gwlauren There’s something wrong with yalls site. It’s been saying this for months &amp; I am registered. Just curious if it’s happening to others. It freaked me out so much I called and spoke with someone to confirm. Maybe that’s the plan?  https://t.co/sYlSBHVzl1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrissyteigen I would have a heart attack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@travisakers Belle &amp; Sebastian<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤣  But in all seriousness we have the right to know if the potus is crushing up adderall &amp; snorting them. Also how has he not had a heart attack with that shit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mistergeezy 2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HerschelWalker @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Now do the guy who hasn’t apologized for his terrible judgement &amp; still thinks he’s right that 5 innocent men deserve the death penalty?  https://t.co/rr8JgqymMi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cbswartz5 This is if none of the other ways work. Believe me I’ve tried them all. Very very wary of any treat I give him 😆  https://t.co/gss0CTcQtP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar Still can’t believe I’m older than her<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cbswartz5 Crush up add water &amp; give through a syringe. Been doing this for the past 2 months with a really sick pup. He’s healing though :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrancisBrennan Absolute garbage humans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanScavino @realDonaldTrump Wow you posted a video of a person doing their job. Woohoo you really showed us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyceWhiteVance I feel like we say this every week, but this week will be crazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatEricAlper  https://t.co/GjqaKCw21b<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyceWhiteVance The census people came to my door like 5 times. (I had already done it &amp; they were in masks) but nope!  I called &amp; made sure they knew to take me off their houses to visit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump @TrumpStudents lol only morons would want a “ground game” during a pandemic that has killed over 160k people 🤷🏻‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pesachlattin @charliekirk11 @TrumpStudents He’s a grifter like all the others.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Ummm his widow can do whatever the fuck she wants with her money! You are calling for people to harass a fucking widow????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scaramucci I 100% beliebe this story because I would have said the same exact thing. He’s a fraud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brhodes This is just absolutely bizarre. He’s a  legit psychopath.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast O m g<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jreganwilliams Mine was my neighbor &amp; I checked his  mailbox to find out his name (prob illegal) then did the whole “do we have mutual friends on Facebook” we did. A great big mouth friend &amp; we’ve been together for 8 years.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@K2thebizA @jeremynewberger I just read a friends post &amp; some dude was telling her how it was all lies then followed with “you wanna know what’s bad &amp; illegal”Nancy pelosi ripping up that speech. 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRickWilson &amp; now they’re using Bolton’s book the one they said was false to push back 🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billyeichner 🤣 same!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WindsorMann His body language just oozes lies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember when trump said this about Paralympics? The @TheAtlantic article is 100% true. #   https://t.co/Q3WtNZAg8t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jbendery @JessReports Biden should just start using this in ads about trump.  https://t.co/t9JrxZExNB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timodc @brhodes 100% they’re just as awful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brhodes the people who heard this &amp; choose to stay silent are as disgusting as he is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HunterJCullen Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremynewberger Racking up felonies to own the libs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peacelovinMimi @mkraju Seriously. Trump literally never wears a fucking mask he has crowds of thousands of people not wearing masks why the fuck do we care about Pelosi standing by one fucking lady. Jeezzz I’m so pissed about this crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DTBbyTheSea @kylegriffin1 Wow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddale8 I have tetralogy of fallot &amp; an icd implant. I was born with these conditions &amp; can live a long healthy life. If i get covid &amp; that kills me it will 100% because of covid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s so wild that one of the biggest liars in the world is the president of the United States. #TrumpIsNotWell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WajahatAli 100%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuzMcBrideBooks I make sure to crack jokes about trunp and talk about losing my healthcare with any new dr I see. You can really tell a lot by their reactions. So far I feel pretty good about my docs.  :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattklapper Omg that baby is so cute 🥰<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump Snakes on a plane<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattGertz @BadFoxGraphics 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaketapper Also this crap is 100% trumps fault. He riled his supporters up &amp; loves this type of crap &amp; they know it. He knew they were heading there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rabiasquared This is the best one I’ve found. It’s absolutely delicious &amp; crispy every time.    https://t.co/hjf3CYwG1A<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaketapper &amp; by my comment I mean he probably hates Biden too. He probably hates all politicians.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mehdirhasan @waltshaub &amp; it’s the second time he’s posted that clip.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jcon95b @jaketapper Ummm no. I’m Saying this person probably hates Biden too. He probably hates all politicians. I don’t understand how you took away me insinuating he was a trump supporter from that. You don’t have to be one or the other in this world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaketapper they sure do deep dives when the person is on the left. Meanwhile white supremacist trumpers kill someone every other weekend &amp; it still gets blamed on the left. This dude sounds unhinged &amp; not even someone his family wanted to be around yet he’ll be called a Biden democrat. 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonfavs I’ll never understand the people who think he’s tough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump When are you going to criticize white supremacists?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@karebear0517 Same<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonIsbell Smashing all my windows Rocks falling in the yard Pretending that you're bigger than you really are<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast He’s so gross.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ImpeachmentHour &amp; hit women<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember when Obama gave a great speech about race &amp; republicans accused him of stoking racial tension. Meanwhile trump praises his insecure white male supporters to go to cities &amp; fuck with protestors &amp; republicans say there’s nothing wrong with that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DearAuntCrabby Im so tired of this shit being normalized. No other president could say &amp; act this way &amp; get away with it. He’s absolute garbage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonfavs So turns out the suburbs are coming to the cities to cause violence &amp; rioting.  Of course everything trump says the other side is doing. His side does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelisaGillett @DearAuntCrabby 100%. Do not care too much for him but he got it last time when everyone mocked him &amp; told him he was crazy. We have to come to terms with how many freaking white people really do like the racism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zebop I hate that’s where my mind went, but it’s starting to feel that way. These cops know cameras are everywhere. They also know they’ll have trumps garbage base behind them &amp; a president who encourages violence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar I hate everything right now. He’s absolutely going to get away with everything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProjectLincoln Disgusting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@svdate Is he trying to pretend his in a hurricane<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProjectLincoln Can we just get a new president &amp; this fuckstick travel the country sitting in a booth at the county fair signing envelopes as he insults them???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProjectLincoln Are you fucking kidding me!!!  Something is very very wrong with him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Wait, didn’t the RNC just spend 4 days trying to tell us what a great empathetic family man trump is 😹😹😹.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@okthenprincess Zero<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast He totally walked through those crowds knowing what would happen. I know there are ways to get around that shit for government “elite”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyceWhiteVance @clairecmc Fact checkers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I still cannot get over republicans calling trump tough for walking through a cleared out empty park alongside military leaders &amp; like 25 staff &amp; secret service. #TrumpIsALaughingStock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@burnaby1953 lol guess putting don &amp; Eric in charge has its perks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thedailybeast They even made her little blurb on his speaker list about trump  https://t.co/WnclmLKjvC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RachelHeine @maddow @JoyAnnReid @NicolleDWallace Same<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonfavs Sad that people in my family who watched me have my first open heart surgery at 3 months with 4 more following that throughout my life would vote for this man who doesn’t give a fuck about me &amp; my survival of this virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaketapper &amp; more will die because of the RNC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidplouffe I’m legit scared of a second term &amp; am not feeling too hopeful. (No one come at me I’ve not “given up” I’m voting &amp; making sure I do everything I can to get Biden elected)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danpfeiffer 100% not true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmrbux2 @therecount @kaitlancollins lol omg staying right by daddy’s side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddale8 Look how they refer to Alice Johnson. I would be appalled if that’s how he described me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnCornyn They wanted to vote for him anyways because this IS trumps America right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremynewberger  https://t.co/Okmoye75y9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddale8 Best part when he said “you don’t know American history” then came out with that whopper of a lie. 🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ConnieSchultz Funny how she can make jokes about her husband being a dick &amp; “telling it like it is” in the same breath as calling for people to stop bullying. She’s pathetic &amp; the media needs to stop normalizing her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeigerNews They’re terrible ignorant people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AhmedBaba_ Ughhhhhh!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jonlovett This is a big deal for a place like this. My boyfriends grandparents lived there. (They were not trumpies) we visited them &amp; weren’t allowed to do the archery training session because my vintage tee had a hole in it &amp; my boyfriend didn’t have on a collared shirt.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LtGovHochulNY @realDonaldTrump Leave it to trump to force a woman to do what she doesn’t want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Okay   October-November 2009 CNN poll: 57% approve of Obama’s handling of H1N1  Today’s FiveThirtyEight average: 39% approve of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>🤣🤣 @pwaites<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast @DonaldJTrumpJr is what they try to portray Hunter of being.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislhayes Same!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahLongwell25 He makes my skin crawl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast Yep &amp; take credit for making things better. Don’t underestimate the ones he’ll rope into believing he’s the savior.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AuthorKimberley lol I’d love to watch trump attack someone over affairs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar I guess my wranglers say it so it’s true 🤷🏻‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast This makes me so angry. We’ve been locked in our homes. It took me 5 min.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PFTompkins Ha! Thought republicans didn’t like cancel culture 👀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pharmalady @kaitlancollins Absolutely &amp; republicans will say it’s the perfect venue for it cause he’s his brother 🤪🤪🤪🤪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kaitlancollins Trump might finally get to speak at a funeral.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MysterySolvent Make up. God yes gross<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddale8 I can’t stand him. He was extra sniffy today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonfavs @SimaforTX Problem is the people who like this sack of shit type of guy do believe it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mehdirhasan We know all the terrible things he’s done, said tweeted in public now imagine the things the GOP senators hear him say in private. They don’t care &amp; will not do a damn thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 I thought they were all going to parler anyways 😹<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Your DNA is currently wanted in a rape case. 🤷🏻‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OhNoSheTwitnt For real, I wonder how many men get random “hows it going” from a random woman that follow them. When ignored they get called an “asshole”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRickWilson  https://t.co/W4zz15jPPN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deneenborelli @realDonaldTrump @KamalaHarris @BlackVoices4DJT You people really need to go back and look at all the amazingly terrible correct things the GOP said about trump :). Also if kamala is so terrible why did Donny &amp; his fake ass daughter donate so much money to her??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddale8 Who was the reporter? I love him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who was that amazing reporter!????? #trumpPressBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddale8 But Trump fucking lies during his answers so doesn’t really matter how many questions he takes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProjectLincoln I want to punch a fucking wall watching him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kaitlancollins Could you ask who that certain person is during his grievance hour today?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrissyteigen But I also only cook pilsbury cookie dough for like 5 minutes &amp; scrape them off the plate with a fork :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrissyteigen I like melty chocolate bars. If they’re super hard I’ll put them in the microwave for 5 seconds. (Obviously not the ice cream ones) 😂😂 my boyfriends face of horror when I do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnBerman @brianstelter Is this his new appeal to suburban Housewives tone?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZerlinaMaxwell COULD YOU IMAGINE IF OBAMA HAD SAID THIS!! Ughh I scream this daily. The bar is so damn low.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoyVBehar @axios This is definitely the first time he’s read this “speech”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShimonPro I thought the same thing. I bet they do not at all like that he came out and spouted that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamieOGrady 10 things I hate about Q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonfavs Six to seven years in it, with me being the primary breadwinner — it’s like, ‘Uh, yeah, this is when people say thank you. I’ll now take that appreciation.’ Yeah, we’re seven years into this, and we’re not buying a second home anytime soon.” -Heidi Cruz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonfavs I’d like him to come to my neighborhood here in Austin where cars snake through for miles every Thursday so people can get some fucking bread canned goods &amp; bananas. This center used to just serve the homeless in the area.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MichaelCoudrey This is from Chile 🤷🏻‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRickWilson He’s so pathetic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProjectLincoln Trump is definitely going to make bike riding political.  I can just see the “bikers for trump” vs. “bikers for biden” ads now 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProjectLincoln Biden should agree to a 4th debate if trump can hang on a two mile bike ride with him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@yashar @politicoalex Why do these fucking clowns take shit from him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MargaretJCR @rachsyme My boyfriend bought a pack of larger men’s sizes from Lowe’s &amp; they were great except loose on the nose &amp; I added pipe cleaners to all of them &amp; they’re great.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MargaretJCR @rachsyme It’s really a game changer!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertMaguire_ lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachsyme Both have pocket to add filter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachsyme Another soft comfy one I got at Whole Foods with pipe cleaner added. These came in packs of 2 the other is black.  https://t.co/vQRxPSuToz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachsyme I bought 2 for $4 cat &amp; jack masks in kids section of target. Then spent 99 cents on pipe cleaners, ran the pipe cleaner from the top hem the masks fit perfect &amp; so comfy not at all loose. I’ve since done it with all the masks we have. Pipe cleaners make a huge difference  https://t.co/uxzxLmqdMk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@matthewamiller They all look like such smug assholes. Poor kids. .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mkraju Their alternative is to stall so trump can make his grand executive order &amp; claim he alone can fix it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BettyBowers God I hate anyone that will use what Michelle obama said as something negative. Like wtf every single person in the world sometimes feels depressed it is absolutely nothing to be ashamed of.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcushjohnson The only way I can see it hurting Biden is if young people who are not engaged at all vote for him just because he’s Kanye. On the other hand I feel better and better about young voters every day &amp; majority of them actually support good causes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soledadobrien Feels like people write these. Get backlash then blame liberal elites trashing their piece so they can ultimately vote the way they wanted..... trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joelockhart @realDonaldTrump I’ve never even seen one episode of the show so this ones easy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@yourmomisacreep @JLewisland when I was in the band &amp; we played a festival together. We were about to sign to a label he was on, definitely the appeal to the label. He greeted us after our set &amp; told ME great job 🤣🤣🤣🤣 surreal... then we all went to catering and sat together for a bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JLewisland Heather Graham &amp; Matthew Settle took me out for sushi once. She had finished a film &amp; I was her assistant. She wanted to try Uchi &amp; took Matt &amp; I along. They were both so great. She’s really a great person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JLewisland Robert Smith except we were sitting together &amp; I wanted to act sooooo cool so I didn’t ask for a photo. 🙄🙄 He was everything I thought he’d be &amp; more. Kind, charming, witty, shy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast Currently waiting on my test. I’m 95%  sure I do not have it &amp; ive been taking every precaution and have barely gone out. I felt crappy the other day &amp; with my extensive heart conditions my drs wanted a test. Reading more &amp; more I’m even more terrified of it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ZerlinaMaxwell My friend who had uterine fibroids time &amp; time again was told by dr’s that nothing was wrong &amp; her pain was probably just due to her having an abortion. The day she gave birth when she WAS READY they had to do a full hysterectomy because she had so much damage from fibroids.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Adehill28 @atrupar It’s so frustrating I want to scream. I don’t know how they do it. I would lose it if he were talking over me like that. It’s one thing if Acosta were being rude but he’s just correcting trumps bullshit words. 😫<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PreetBharara How are we this far into this admin &amp; these committees do not get together &amp; come up with the best questions to ask to get the facts. This grandstanding for a sound bite is so silly. The biggest sound bites would be having barr admit to his lies &amp; you have to question for that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@yashar Now can every person from @MSNBC &amp; @CNN put out their videos stating them asking @realDonaldTrump to be on their show? Because I know his chickenshit ass won’t sit down with @NicolleDWallace @JoyAnnReid @maddow @jaketapper @AC360 @donlemon and many many more.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GeorgeO52122779 @TheCapone2 @chrissyteigen Not really the point. Just interesting seeing people dig through others past calling out whatever you think is “triggering” yet, do not allow others to know a thing about you. It’s just cowardly that’s all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cjtruth @chrissyteigen She’s already addressed this. Keep up, thought y’all Q’s we’re good at investigating 🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GeorgeO52122779 @TheCapone2 @chrissyteigen Where do you get your info? “Mainstream” has now become an easy buzz word.

You do you.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeO52122779 @TheCapone2 @chrissyteigen It’s also pathetic when people will not use their own name &amp; photo 🤣<|endoftext|>

I just cannot believe this is okay &amp; not one R senator will speak out about how disgraceful it is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KFILE @TVietor08 God I hate him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You are so pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BennyAce @daveweigel @jonfavs &amp; trump called for &amp; stands by calling for the death of 5 innocent exonerated black/brown men.  https://t.co/iSjS1LJ40I<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SamanthaJPower Why is it so hard for them to spot &amp; delete? I don’t need anyone to attack me, I’m seriously asking.  Are they tough to pick out?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast That’s disgusting without the virus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sethgs But joe Biden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TVietor08 @JoeNBC Wow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Soooo trump created this mess because he knew maga was better than kag.... pass it on :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonLemire Why can’t twitter delete them 🤷🏻‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonlovett Lady and the trump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast Yep. It’s infuriating us dems are so bad at this 😭😭😭<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TVietor08 Which is even more dangerous because he’s pushing for others to put themselves at risk while he’s covered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TVietor08 I almost died from my arrhythmia. Serious shit. I now have a hunk of metal in my chest that controls it. These are reasons I don’t think trump is taking that drug. No cardiologist in their right mind would okay a POTUS his age to take a drug that could speed up their heart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IngrahamAngle I have not been to a grocery store in 2 months. I’m fortunate my boyfriend does it. With my major congenital heart defect I was born with, it’s unsafe for me.Things would be different if your daddy trump retained information &amp; didn’t use his gut as measurement for public health.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ZekeJMiller @TVietor08 Trumps very bad no good month<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@travisakers He’s going to be real mad when he finds out we can get absentee ballots here in Texas if we fear covid :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WindsorMann Yep, Just watched the video of him saying he’s taking it &amp; he’s straight up lying. You can tell how on the fly he says it. He’s a damn liar!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonfavs Fuck trump. I’ve had a defibrillator since I was 32 because of atrial fibrillation from a heart condition at birth. This drug could literally kill me. Some people are unfortunate enough to not know they have these conditions. He will literally kill people.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PodSaveAmerica @danpfeiffer @jonfavs I’m still confused by low turn out with mail in voting? What am I missing that sounds like a dream! In Texas we’ll probably never have that option. 😔 Is it more complicated than just filling out a form &amp; sticking it in a mailbox? Honestly curious what I’m missing here.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@brhodes Tell Nichole to cut &amp; bring you back on.  That was more informative<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shannonrwatts Next pool spray someone needs to ask trump what he thinks about his supporters sending her death threats &amp; will he please denounce it. I guarantee he’ll have some messed up half ass response.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MZHemingway Serious question: What is the appropriate remedy or response for the years of fake news being peddled by the POTUS? He’s caused major damage to domestic health and foreign relations. He is continuing the fake news even now. What can be done? What should be done?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just saw this driving around a neighborhood @GOP @realDonaldTrump :)  https://t.co/WlQuTMZCrT<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bernard_Brah @TVietor08 They’re definitely not. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This day like 12 years ago my mom had just gotten her crematory license &amp; we cremated a body together. Not dark considering what they did for a living, totally normal. Seriously one of my most memorable moments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsrhondabitch @TVietor08 lol, my boyfriend always says “I was using that one” no matter which one or how long it’s been there. 🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @MikeGarcia2020 @GavinNewsom How is trying to make everyone that can vote.....vote! rigging?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jackiehluo I love how everyone thinks @chrissyteigen just showed up &amp; became famous for cooking &amp; being married. She was a freaking successful model FIRST! It’s her amazing real personality that skyrocketed her on Twitter or insta. She’s fucking funny &amp; that’s all her not some “farm”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Theodora500AD @kaitlancollins My thoughts exactly.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@brhodes @jonlovett It’s terrifying &amp; I’m afraid that’s where we’re headed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaketapper @TheRickWilson He’s such a terrible small person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRickWilson @ProjectLincoln Congrats!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PodSaveAmerica @jonlovett PUSH HIM ON WHY HE HAS NOT ANNOUNCED A PLAN!!!! Ughhh they’re so annoying letting him run all over them &amp; take over the question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bethanyshondark @SethAMandel When you have “wife of” on your twitter info this is what happens. Funny you’re mad about this yet, you’re the one bringing to everyone’s attention you’re “someone’s wife”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KristerJohnson @TheRickWilson Jeez, these people can’t do anything right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump lol he totally was watching @SRuhle this morning. #lazypresident<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheRickWilson Guessing the name hunter will be back on their lips next week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRickWilson Trump hasn’t gotten an erection in months, he needs a rally so bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bachase4 @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Ohh really?? Looks like you didn’t start paying attention until now. Maybe you never heard about this stuff because Obama didn’t whine like a baby every time his feelings got hurt.  https://t.co/bppU0JhI5M<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TVietor08 The interview on the bulwark podcast was really great too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Acyn lol always something he’s doing that he blames others for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benshapiro Where’s trumps tax returns?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@revrrlewis I mean wasn’t it kind of obvious that everyone else was wearing a mask &amp; and you were in a place full of people with it 🤷🏻‍♀️ Trump definitely told him not to wear one because he would look weak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mkraju I called my dog my boyfriends name twice last week. We were moving houses &amp; a bit stressed I think her stress might be a tad more than mine.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Fired_Soon It’s even sometimes annoying because if he’s holding something heavy of course I want him to get in &amp; set down. Trump has zero respect for anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fired_Soon My boyfriend will not even walk into the house without motioning for me to go first! It doesn’t even matter if his hands are completely full &amp; I’m barely holding anything. If he gets to the door first he Waits for me to walk in first. Yes it’s mundane &amp; I def do not require it 🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@secupp @NormOrnstein Right!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthewamiller Omg fauci’s hand on his head when trump called it the deep state department. 👀👀 trump might fire the most important man on that stage.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jdawsey1 I almost died when he said that 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TVietor08 Someone should ask dr fauci if trump should be tested<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djrothkopf @realHirondelle He won’t, he has hotels there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar @TheRickWilson I don’t believe he has not been tested. Seems like it would be protocol &amp; he wouldn’t have a choice in it. Something is fishy about all of this. Maybe they want us all to focus on this part of it while they know he’s fine? I don’t trust a single thing out of that place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs  https://t.co/gLOU4qLQwM<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WajahatAli He’ll look at being tested as weak 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ShahidForChange @mehdirhasan @AssociatedPress He doesn’t want his base missing his rallies. He’d rather them get sick &amp; die than miss a hate rally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Susan_Hennessey @AlyssaMastro44 What happened with “ anyone who wants a test, gets a test” like @realDonaldTrump said 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 I’m sure the reason there are barely any tests because trumps hoarding them all for himself &amp; his family to take daily.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brhodes He’s making fun of Elizabeth Warren too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sgdrivingwallet @CaroleRadziwill Here he’s touching his face.     https://t.co/X58LcmhNpb<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AlyssaMastro44 @TVietor08 I thought Republicans weren’t politicizing this ¯\_(ツ)_/¯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@occamsrazor45 @tamarakeithNPR @jdawsey1 @realDonaldTrump @VP Yep! Scapegoat.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What an amazing man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar He sees joes numbers &amp; throwing in Obama/Biden jabs wherever he can get them. He’s dirty &amp; The media needs to call this shit out for the lies that it is immediately<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rschooley @KevinMKruse @LemieuxLGM I can 😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soledadobrien @sheeshkabob How demeaning having that man have to speak about something so important over a freaking helicopter. Trumps disrespect has no end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar While Biden’s gaffs are a little concerning this is far more concerning because he’s well.... the president! Media needs to focus on this, the man who is currently in office making all of the decisions.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ddale8 Ahhh of course.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddale8 Is he going to a rally?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddale8 They are pathetic. He’ll just claim he did it knowing it was fake, but to “trigger” liberals. Problem with that it triggers their base into believing absolute lies from here on out. You’ll never be able to convince them it was not said because dear leaders son put it on Instagram<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TVietor08 @SenCoryGardner @SenatorCollins @SenMcSallyAZ @SenThomTillis Why don’t these reporters speak up when he lies? They just stand there yucking it up &amp; laughing at his insults.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AhmedBaba_ Absolutely &amp; no one in his party will say a think. They’ll twist themselves into pretzels to unjustly justify the move.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump This never gets old  https://t.co/DpzIwFazYV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrissyteigen @NYMag Maybe their time would be better spent talking about the actual NDA’s powerful rapey men make women sign. I dunno men like the shitstain in the White House.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FreeGirlNowNYC @ddale8 Yea, I’m sure she was devastated it’s just so freaking tacky to go on &amp; on &amp; on the way he does. I mean we know he has no class. Baffles my damn mind people listen to him &amp; think “yea, this is the freaking guy I’m all in for”. 😖😖<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FreeGirlNowNYC @ddale8 I feel like the Scalise hospital story about his wife is probably way off too, but those two are too big of cowards to tell the truth or contradict their dear leader.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@matthewamiller This is absolutely insane. Republicans would rightly so go bat shit crazy if Robert Bauer was doing this!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump This shit is not normal! I refuse to just get over it &amp; act like it’s not a big deal. The potus is on Twitter everyday attacking US Government officials &amp; private citizens. ITS NOT FUCKING NORMAL!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Imagine your spouse dying after a long battle with cancer &amp; the president of the United States trashing you on Twitter about it numerous times months after their death.

<|startoftext|>@brianbeutler So If there is anything into trump it gets scrapped?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar Have you guys watched the family on Netflix? Prayer breakfast is full of frauds and some I’m sure are fine people.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@guypbenson @realDonaldTrump I’m Alive &amp; not in debt because of D’s  healthcare plan.

It’s been 3 years &amp; he has done zero on healthcare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stronghand42069 @brendagaylern Guess they should have acted more like this disrespectful senile fraud.  https://t.co/dhHrU1vpIw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edavies @MiamiHerald It’s really not. Look how mortified Barron &amp; Melania are. He is not well!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillKristol Trump will viciously attack manchin on Twitter &amp; all republicans will fall in line &amp; back off. No one will reprimand him because the gop have no spine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mschlapp Triggered<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@washingtonpost Not holding my breath 😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stronghand42069 @brendagaylern I noticed a lot of white people sitting around them that no one seems to mention/attack them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WajahatAli @TheRickWilson This is amazing I kept watching thinking they would somehow make trump look good, nope you guys got the message across loud &amp; clear how freaking stupid he is.  🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Acosta I hope trump accidentally watches this episode. Especially the end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This actually needs to go viral.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m pretty convinced the preacher at the #ImpeachmentTrial is a never trumper.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Susan_Hennessey &amp; we know that will not happen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neal_katyal @NicolleDWallace None of it matters. They have the votes, they don’t care. After they vote they’ll say it’s old news we aren’t removing him...move on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ManSaffer @BresPolitico Lol why are we kidding ourselves. They want that Hannity super bowl commercial to be all “vindication”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can actually see the GOP try &amp; nulify trump being impeached. They obviously do not care about rules, laws or the constitution. #GOPCowards #RIPGOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CourtneyLyn4128 @empowergracewi Yep :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CourtneyLyn4128 @empowergracewi Yep, When anymore evidence comes out no matter how damning it is they’re going to say he was exonerated it’s over and everyone will move on. The media will say well no one cares anymore and they’ll move on and he will get away with everything and sadly probably win reelection.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JuddLegum So trump is golfing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArrowErica @fayth_clair @DearAuntCrabby I know. I’m sure if he had not become president he probably would have traded her in for a newer model (no pun intended) :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fayth_clair @ArrowErica @DearAuntCrabby Seriously check her out in 96 😳  https://t.co/UdomGfgsy2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DearAuntCrabby She was a nothingburger model, I’d never even heard of her before him. Also all the surgery she’s had must have made her face like that. If you look through these photos she’s super wide eyed when younger.  https://t.co/EL90UZKAve<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Susan_Hennessey Yep I wondered this too. I feel like he’ll start sending a family member or himself to events at his properties If people start pulling out so there is heightened security &amp; most importantly To him no money lost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarbMcQuade @matthewamiller Yep<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@douglasblackmon @realDonaldTrump After graduating from Penn in 2000, Trump Jr. moved to Aspen, Colorado, where he hunted, fished, skied, lived in a truck, and worked as a bartender for a year, before returning to join the Trump Organization in New York.

<|startoftext|>@John_Hudson @yashar He was mad his stupid little secret meeting didn’t work out so he implied it was the family &amp; Boris Johnson’s fault. I hope they both come out &amp; set the record straight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Susan_Hennessey 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump For perspective, Donald trump has cheated on more of his wives &amp; assaulted more women than he’s had positive talks with China.  #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Catalina1016 @yashar Seriously, he probably goes back &amp; forth from English to Spanish every day he’s in El Paso. So silly to see anyone give a damn about this when trump cannot string together 2 basic English words.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@frannygtops @TheRickWilson Lol, okay. I never said they didn’t get things done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frannygtops @TheRickWilson What are you talking about? Of course i know where the real blame lies. My point is (we) democrats have a long history of not holding onto the narrative &amp; trump &amp; the gop hijack it. It’s exactly what is happening now. Ignoring that is a problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Annie1But Yep, now saying they’re not handing stuff over because there’s not a full vote in the house, they’re just fucking lawless. I swear this shitstain gets away with everything it’s so disheartening. I don’t understand how he constantly turns it back to him where he’s the victim.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@alliebwoods @BetoORourke That’s why I didn’t cancel months ago, they made it so hard!! They did it through chat this time, it was really easy except he kept asking me to stay.

<|startoftext|>@AmoneyResists @realDonaldTrump This isn’t true, can’t stand the guy &amp; I’m sure they all want to delete them but we can’t spread false information. However will look pretty bad if the right jumps on this to “own the libs” &amp; have to retweet all of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crypt0e @shaunking @BetoORourke Yes, 220,000 votes is “so close”. Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunking @BetoORourke He makes me so proud to be a Texan, not many things do lately. No matter what happens with his presidential candidacy, he is a true genuine leader. He came so damn close to beating Cruz &amp; that says a lot here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve3PO_ @NBCNews Exactly what I thought<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Funny how @realDonaldTrump can blame 1 congressman for a whole cities crime &amp; yet it’s too far fetched for his supporters to blame trump for mass murder when the shooters specifically quote him and/or support him in some way.  #ElPasoShooting #daytonshooting #massshootings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Susan_Hennessey He also knows so many people there because of how he campaigns and gets to know his community.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mynameisBethS @atrupar @cspan so frustrating. Obama passed veterans choice!!! How freaking hard is it for the dude just say wait...Obama passed that. I don’t care if it wasn’t Obama could’ve been a bush, Clinton, Carter it doesn’t matter who, but don’t let him take credit for something that’s not his!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TVietor08 Every reporter from now on needs to ask for his clarity on this. Obviously he has none, but will be fun seeing him get pissed &amp; dig his hole deeper.

<|startoftext|>@NicolleDWallace Gross people questioning Mueller’s mental capacity when every freaking day trump says/does things that are symptoms of a neurological disorder.

<|startoftext|>Can the media stop with how #Mueller was not Col. Nathan R. Jessep &amp; focus on how many freaking lies trump has told starting with beating it into the country’s head that mueller begged him for a job???? #MuellerHearings #MuellerTestimony<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tameekachang @aolbites @shaunking Seriously not everyone needs praise or a paper trail for helping.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunking I’ve never claimed a single penny that I’ve donated. So many gofundme’s, Human Rights Campaign, candidates, school lunch programs. Just because your taxes do not show every penny means absolutely zero. We will surely lose in 2020 if this continues to be what outrages everyone.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mamabearwakesup @JamesMSama @realDonaldTrump Literally not the point. They have still not released the murderers picture. Yes it’s great they’re showing him but making it look like he’s the killer to idiots who just glance at articles &amp; do not read. When this happened they used that photo &amp; the comments were blaming him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesMSama @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/DhQlk5NkmN  It’s really frustrating to me they use the deceased Hispanic officers photo on all the articles about this. The killer is a white 59 year old male. They still have not released his photo.<|endoftext|>
