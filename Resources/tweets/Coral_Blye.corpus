<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi You should be handing your Gavel to Katie Porter, who actually believes in working for the people..

<|startoftext|>@Giants_826 @apeachinthecity @McKaylaRoseJ You should probably look at ALL OF TRUMPS CHILDREN, bringing up Hunter Biden like he's relevant to this situation... Lmao. Didn't Ivanka get a fucking speed up on ALL OF HER CHINESE PATENTS..??? But yes, continue. Idiots..<|endoftext|>
