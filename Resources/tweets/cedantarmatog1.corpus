<|startoftext|>Joe Manchin and Mitt Romney will control our lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@david_shane Democrats vote in lock step no matter how bad the candidates.  John James is so much better than Peters but doesn't matter to them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing to see here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@honcho_miguel Yes, but there was enough of shift in middle class voters it seems to make a difference....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you are middle class person who voted Trump in 2016, but changed to Biden in 2020 you are an idiot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden-Harris is illegitimate.  This isn't 2008 or 2012.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I mean protesting but also simply refusing to accept illegitimately elected person and saying it constantly and publicly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dentintheworld After Bush was elected the Swamp grew massively thanks to the growth of National Security State.  It's not an accident that the counties around DC grew so large and got so wealthy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dentintheworld Yes.  That's true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's called cheating through 'mail in' ballots<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How do you get 90% voter turnout?  Massive voter fraud through 'mail in' ballots<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If not for incredible brainwashing psyop carried out by media and Big Tech, this election would have been easily for Republicans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@russell_nm Not enough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LibertyLynx wait another 5 years in USA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Truth.  I'm not sure it would have mattered who was President but this is true.  21st Century has been a steady move to centralized control.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope It will return in January<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@insomnochick Not me.  It's an illegitimate process<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sallyeastman1 Libertarian vote in specific States might give Biden-harris the win.  That's what I mean<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Weird....isn't it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right must become more openly aggressive in opposing illegitimately elected candidates.  (I don't mean violence)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden-Harris will be promoting this in every school and college in America.  Thanks Libertarians.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Republicans had held governor in Wisconsin in 2018 (lost by a very thin margin) Trump would have won that State (as he really did)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This means almost 2 million people registered on Election day.....not probable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden-Harris = illegitimate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jaizem Anticipation of more Federal spending<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She's a committed progressive.  We agree on foreign policy and little else.  However, I just want to say I'm thinking about #TaraReade right now.  God bless. @ReadeAlexandra I can't imagine what it feels like to be you right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump should start having rallies in Pennsylvania<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ahmadalissa Good for you. Peace for Syria.  If Biden wins, be prepared for many worse things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Massive voter fraud in the entire country through "mail in" ballots and ballot harvesting schemes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ridiculous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>why should it?  They were successful in their goals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For Libertarians to vote in swing States and screw us over<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@austinruse @JZmirak Chances Martin is NOT a homosexual: 0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>all these tweeters better be right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fraud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. #Fraud in Michigan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great idea. And start just reading declassified information about Hayden, Brennan, and Clapper<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No.  Fraud maybe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Successful Fraud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bradyleonard And he's an amazing guy.  He'd be a great national voice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No one who voted for Trump should recognize Biden as legitimate if they steal it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This group could go really big soon or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok......this makes no sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Suppression Polls was accurate description.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Democrats tried this scam in 2018 and it almost worked in Florida and Georgia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fraud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StoicMDJ I don't want a Savior but rather the guy who won't lock our economy down, take my rifles, and leave me alone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fraud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fraud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Illegitimate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do we know he won or not?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Libertarians may have given this election to the guy who will be confiscating rifles, closing private schools, forcing you to confess your racial sins, and raising your taxes.  This was a strategy vote not a purity one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fraud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fraud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grego81920578 Ok, that's not what the above tweet insinuates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please don't tweet such things unless it's real<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fraud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fraud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>yeah, this happened<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok.....whatever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nickgb Yes, it's bizarre they didn't vote for Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's the odds of so many Democrat votes laying around till this morning?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I found 138K votes all for Trump in my car in Michigan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RT and share<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here it is.  #JoeBidenCrimeFamily #Fraud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@insomnochick %5 drop in support overall is weird.   I actually think it's old men who are scarred of the #ChinaVirus &amp; relate to Dementia Joe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No one should accept these results.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@insomnochick Democrats answer No to your questions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@insomnochick No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's clear some at Fox News were actively seeking to defeat Republicans last night<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did you really think districts that are complete ethnic enclaves had a chance to flip?  These voters expect corruption and graft.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Media doesn't care<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Last night I was leading, often solidly, in many key States, in almost all instances Democrat run &amp; controlled. Then, one by one, they started to magically disappear as surprise ballot dumps were counted. VERY STRANGE, and the “pollsters” got it completely &amp; historically wrong!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fraud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you think the group that promotes this won't cheat?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fraud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you actually believe that Democrats care about war, sexual harassment, voting integrity?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Democrat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>128K<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Correct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>128,000 to 0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DangerousLiber1 If Libertarians wanted to keep their rifles they would have voted another way.  No chance for her.  a 2-1 break of votes and Trump's already won with no contest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden said: "We have the biggest voter fraud organization" seen the video?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Libertarians who'd prefer a pure 2% in many States could have saved up from a gun grabber.  They chose not to do so.  And all the weirdos who voted for American Constitutional Party or whatever it's called.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They gave you a Russian Conspiracy Hoax and Impeachment.  Do you really think this crowd won't cheat?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Read it now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He was telling the truth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Coordinated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At this point, is there any way you could see a Biden win as legitimate?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DemocratsAreCorrupt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylenabecker @Metalworks4 Correct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In a month or so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never Trump will come out tomorrow and tell Pres Trump to give up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cheating is taking place<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All the idiots voting for Libertarian and other fringe parties may give away their gun rights and freedom of association.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Suburban Whites are culturally offended by the lower middle-class-working class alliance.   Many voted for Biden even though it's not in their own interests economically.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We need to start organizing protests now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why would they do this for a racist?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pankystob It's been that way for years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's Fox News' new business model?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Suburban moderate white people hate Donald Trump more than Hispanics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd agree with you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doctorcherokee And it's mostly suburban white folks who have switched the voting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hellcat707S @TopSportsMind @catturd2 @realDonaldTrump Yes very early<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaxMMarin Who's monitoring these counters?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Joe Biden was ahead in all these places he would have declared victory<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doctorcherokee let's wins Georgia.  No reason not to do so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only folks left watching Fox News are over 70.  Except for Tucker and Laura maybe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly.  It was amazingly bad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cheating<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never Trump and Bush speech writer.  He wrote the Axis of Evil speech<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To cheat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never Trumper<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump has won GA, NC, and will win Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same Media and Big Tech told you Biden was ahead by 10 points are telling you that Trump didn't win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big Tech told us for months they controlled this election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This.  And former Generals and CIA members.   https://t.co/b5t8oCQkYT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pres. Trump has won. #StopTheSteal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As I predicted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FightinBluHen51  https://t.co/b5t8oCQkYT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#StopTheSteal Donald Trump has won<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look up General Stanley McChrystal and DARPA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never Trumpers are about to attack Trump instead of attacking the fake elections<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the loser Conservatives who were butthurt since 2016 had got involved instead of switching sides this wouldn't be this close<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pres. Trump has won<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you say something stupid like: I don't know why California isn't going Red tonight then I'm unfollowing you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden wins1 vote in NE-02 even though Republican wins House seat.  Thousands of votes for Republican seat and for Biden.  How stupid are people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the hell?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They purposely stopped counting in Georgia to thwart Trump's speech<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Phillygirl741 It didn't<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine if we had an honest media and Google didn't manipulate searches.  That accounts for millions of votes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good sign<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saw that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump has won.  Only way he loses now is if cheating happens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No way Trump loses unless there's cheating<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How hard is it to keep counting ballots?  This is ridiculous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How stupid are many voters in USA?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is Pres. Trump speaking tonight?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Truth.  If it was a 60/40 media for Biden, it wouldn't be close right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Literally Biden had a multiple polls saying he was 10 points ahead for months.  How ridiculous is that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Democrats are trying to find dead voters in Philadelphia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We could do worst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Censored tweet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VioletIrwin76 Definitely Georgia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Appointing McSally 2 years ago was a really bad decision<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can you imagine if Democrats spent the money on people instead of Senate races they had no chance wining in? @jimmy_dore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope Collins wins<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Libertarians give certain States to Biden I will never consider voting for any candidate associated with them again.  I have voted Libertarian in the past.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. Scripted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, I went to my grandpa's house.....what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Whole Team man.....john...uh...what<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes scripted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is scripted.  Remember them telling you "Trump may be ahead"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is Jill wearing a mask standing next to her husband?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The cars thing is the dumbest thing ever #JoeBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God wins because he's God.  That doesn't change our situation if Biden and Dems win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you want this, you should have voted Republican<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Georgia.....Dems in Atlanta trying to cheat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump got more Black and Hispanic voters and less Whites.  I can't believe how stupid some Whites are<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Georgia?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are trying to cheat in Philadelphia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump should start holding rallies in Pennsylvania and Michigan tomorrow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>White men may be the dumbest group in America then......this election would be over now if they don't drop support for Trump....that's amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Agreed, but it won't be.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I don't blame @JoeBiden for doing this.  He avoided massive amounts of taxes in 2017-18:   https://t.co/kG4GR0KUOb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotATweeter16 @maggieNYT It's weird how Trump's Admin has opposed Putin's main goals everywhere including in Iran and Ukraine.  Putin helped make Biden's Iran deal in 2015.  Trump ended it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wil_da_beast630 Donald Trump has lost money being president.  He gave away his salary.  He legally sought many ways to reduce his taxes. Good for him.<|endoftext|>
