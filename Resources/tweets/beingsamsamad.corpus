<|startoftext|>@TrimiziiiSyeda For obtaining knowledge, strength, and motivation, the source and path also need to be authentic and right. There's no doubt making and watching such dramas is prohibited in Islam. The source of its narration is mostly fictional without any historical proof.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrimiziiiSyeda The person, Ibnul Arbi is not even an authentic scholar, but people raised him as sheik ul Akbar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrimiziiiSyeda The biggest drawback of this drama is, it will ruin your eemaan. This will mislead you and take you to sufism. Muslims are watching it to gain some strength and motivation, but contrary they will get weaken and ruined.<|endoftext|>
