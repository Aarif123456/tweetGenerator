<|startoftext|>In total,researchers analysed 172 pottery fragments excavated from rural/urban settlements.The study helped to draw better comparisons of the various Indus valley settlements and on the usage of ceramic vessels.   üì∏:Akshyeta Suryanarayan/Journal of Archaeological Science  https://t.co/mVj4XKj6Px<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The team acknowledges that one of the biggest challenges to understanding the diet of these civilisations is the limited availability of evidence.The team hypothesizes that mixtures of plant and animal products could have been used in these vessels,giving an ambiguous conclusion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The findings also assert that despite a large number of remains of domestic animals excavated from the sites, there has been no direct evidence found on the use of dairy products in vessels.  #indusvalleycivilization<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After studying the lipid profiles, the researchers looked into the type of food consumed during this period. For this, the team conducted an isotopic analysis of fatty acids to detect what type of meat was cooked in these ancient vessels.   #indusvalleycivilization<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The evidence for the ancient South Asian civilisation‚Äôs affinity towards meat comes from the prehistoric ceramic cooking vessels extracted from several archaeological sites, which belonged to the rural and urban settlers of that time.   #indusvalleycivilization<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The research was conducted in the northwest parts of India‚Äîwhere the #Indusvalley flourished‚Äîwhich now forms part of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.The study highlighted that the people in those times ate a variety of animal meat, including pigs, cattle, buffalo, sheep and goat.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This practice keeps the soil biodiversity intact by preventing soil erosion, reducing the impact of heavy rains, conserving soil moisture, and keeping the soil temperatures even.  #WorldSoilDay2020 #WorldSoilDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Mulching is usually done for cultivating commercial crops, fruit trees, vegetables, flowers, etc. The method can be carried out in an organic way (using paddy straw) as well as an inorganic way (using plastics).   #WorldSoilDay2020 #WorldSoilDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Mulching is a method in which the open surface of the ground is covered with protective materials in order to enrich and protect the soil. For this, the material is tightly placed on the top of the soil.  #WorldSoilDay2020 #WorldSoilDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tilling can, in this process, also affect the soil structure, thereby causing soil erosion. It also reduces topsoil, which affects the fertility and quality of the soil.  #WorldSoilDay2020 #WorldSoilDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But this practice may negatively impact the soil‚Äôs biodiversity and quality, along with its characteristics like water retention, temperature, infiltration, and evapotranspiration.   #WorldSoilDay2020 #WorldSoilDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Zero tillage technique improves soil biodiversity  Tillage is basically an agricultural practice to churn up the soil through methods like digging, stirring, and overturning for crop production. This method has been used by farmers for more than 100 years.  #WorldSoilDay2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Soil biodiversity helps fight climate change  Soil is known as carbon sequester, and therefore, it can help combat climate change. It is estimated that the soil can store about 2,500 gigatons of carbon.   #WorldSoilDay2020 #WorldSoilDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Soil fertility is also greatly dependent on biological components of soil like bacteria, fungi, or algae. Experts state that the presence of diverse soil microbes protects the plant from harmful pathogens.   #WorldSoilDay2020 #WorldSoilDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These microorganisms provide essential nutrients for crop plant growth such as nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, potassium, calcium, magnesium and micronutrients. As soil health improves, the microorganisms thrive in it even better.  #WorldSoilDay2020 #WorldSoilDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As per the UN, out of all the microorganisms present in soil, only 1% of the species are known to science‚Äîin comparison, we know of at least 80% of all the plant species. In fact, just a teaspoon of topsoil is estimated to contain up to 6 billion microorganisms.   #WorldSoilDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Microorganisms engineer the soil  Microorganisms are known as the natural soil engineers and play an important role in soil formation and soil ecology. Soil is known to hold 1/4th (25%) of the planet's biodiversity.   #WorldSoilDay2020 #WorldSoilDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In spite of its importance to human life, however, soil remains prone to several threats which can adversely impact its biodiversity, including soil erosion, land use, unsustainable farming practices, and excessive use of fertilizers, to name a few.  #WorldSoilDay2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On this day, it must also be acknowledged that healthy soil is responsible for producing more nutritious and safer food‚Äîaltogether, 95% of our food is soil-based.   #WorldSoilDay2020 #WorldSoilDay (Image credit: Aniruddhasingh D/TOI, BCCL, Nagpur)  https://t.co/YtLyVNvgCS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In Kerala, heavy rains have been predicted in Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, Kottayam, Idukki, and Ernakulam districts, with the intense spells likely to continue on Friday and Saturday.  #Burevi  #CycloneBureviUpdate #CycloneBurevi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many parts of Tamil Nadu, including Chennai and the delta districts, have already witnessed light to heavy rainfall, whereas Lalpet in Cuddalore has recorded 271 mm precipitation between 8:30 a.m. on December 3 and 6:30 a.m. on December 4.  #Burevi  #CycloneBureviUpdate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heavy showers at isolated places are also very likely over Lakshadweep area and south coastal Andhra Pradesh during the next 24 hours.  #Burevi  #CycloneBureviUpdate #CycloneBurevi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Under the influence of this system, the IMD has predicted heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places across Tamil Nadu, Puducherry &amp; Karaikal, and Kerala &amp; Mahe during the next 24 hours.   #Burevi  #CycloneBureviUpdate #CycloneBurevi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But from there on, Burevi could re-intensify into a cyclonic storm over the Southwest Arabian Sea on Monday or Tuesday.  #Burevi  #CycloneBureviUpdate #CycloneBurevi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Weather Channel‚Äôs met team adds that Burevi is likely to reach Kerala on Saturday morning, hover over Kerala coast on Saturday evening/night, and then pass over the Arabian Sea.   #Burevi  #CycloneBureviUpdate #CycloneBurevi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the deep depression over the Gulf of Mannar remained practically stationary at 5:30 a.m. IST on Friday‚Äîabout 40 km southwest of Ramanathapuram, 70 km west-southwest of Pamban, and 160 km northeast of Kanyakumari.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#WeatherUpdate| Heavy rainfall is predicted over isolated places of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Lakshadweep. Widespread rain and thunderstorms are expected over Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Lakshadweep.   Read:  https://t.co/9dIzOAyjha  https://t.co/JOXXKF9nXh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The report also looks at the effect of the #COVID19Pandemic on these sites. The reduced number of tourists has eased the pressure on the ecosystems, while negative impacts include financial loss and also rise in illegal activities due to lesser staff during the lockdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IUCN Director-General Bruno Oberle urged that the natural world heritage sites are among the most precious places in the world and hence we must protect them for our future generations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In total 63% of the heritage sites fall under the category ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúgood with some concerns‚Äù while," 30% are of "significant concern" and 7% are "critical." Human activities like tourism, hunting and fishing, and livestock grazing have also had an impact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moreover, Mexico's Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve, Spain's Garajonay National Park, Olympic National Park in the United States also face a ‚Äúvery high‚Äù threat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Great Barrier Reef‚Äîthe world's largest coral reef‚Äî in Australia is severely threatened and falls under the ‚Äúvery high‚Äù threat category, due to acidification, extreme weather and ocean warming. This has led to decline in corals and a decrease in the number of marine species.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since the last report in 2017, sixteen world heritage sites have deteriorated while only eight have seen improvement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@UNESCO has listed 252 world heritage sites in total and 83 among these are being damaged by climate change; increase in the number of natural calamities like forest fires, floods and droughts, shrinking of glaciers, coral reef bleaching are some of the examples.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Outlook 3 report builds on previous Outlook reports in 2014 and 2017, and says that climate change is now the most significant threat to the World Heritage Sites and has overtaken the threat by invasive species which was the previous most-dominant threat.   #ClimateChange<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Now, instead of the standard 14-day quarantine, it has been recommending, the CDC has said that individuals that do not develop any symptoms need only quarantine for 10 days. And if they test negative, that period can be further reduced to just one week.  #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also revised its COVID-19 #quarantine guidelines.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Symptoms like difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, chest pain or pressure, and loss of speech or movement can also be seen in severe cases.  #coronavirus #CoronaVirusUpdates #CovidSymptoms<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But the infected individuals may also experience aches and pains, sore throat, diarrhoea, conjunctivitis, headache, a rash on the skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes, along with the aforementioned loss of taste or smell.   #coronavirus #CoronaVirusUpdates #CovidSymptoms<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fever, dry cough, and tiredness remain the most common symptoms of #COVID19.    #coronavirus #CoronaVirusUpdates #CovidSymptoms<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Health agencies like CDC or WHO are yet to confirm the new symptoms.   #coronavirus #CoronaVirusUpdates #CovidSymptoms<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These nasal signs also lasted for about twelve days on an average.  #coronavirus #CoronaVirusUpdates #CovidSymptoms<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The study also found that these nasal symptoms predominantly co-occurred with the reduced ability to detect smells and the loss of taste functions‚Äîtwo already prevalent COVID-19 symptoms‚Äîwhile also appearing principally before or during the other symptoms of the viral disease.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Furthermore, about 52% of the patients from the clinical group experienced constant nasal irritation, as opposed to just 3% from the control group.  #coronavirus #CoronaVirusUpdates #CovidSymptoms<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Subsequently, more than 68% of the patients reported at least one ‚Äúnasal‚Äù symptom. These patients also experienced ‚Äúa strange sensation in the nose‚Äù and excessive nasal dryness significantly more often than the control group.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While these patients were categorised into the clinical group, the researchers also used a control group to compare the results.  #coronavirus #CoronaVirusUpdates #CovidSymptoms<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Researchers at the University of Barcelona reviewed 35 cases of #COVID19, wherein these patients were surveyed about the nasal symptoms they experienced while being infected with the virus.   #coronavirus #CoronaVirusUpdates #CovidSymptoms<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A recent study has come across a new nose-related symptom of #COVID19‚Äîdeemed a ‚Äústrange sensation in the nose‚Äù‚Äîwhich could potentially facilitate early diagnosis of the disease, along with the initial social distancing efforts.  #coronavirus #CoronaVirusUpdates #CovidSymptoms<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But even as the vaccines begin to rollout, research on novel coronavirus has continued, and now, we may well have found a new symptom of #COVID19 at these late stages.  #coronavirus #CoronaVirusUpdates #CovidSymptoms<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The world appears to be on the cusp of beginning an all-out attack on COVID-19, with England, Russia, and the US set to begin their vaccination drives in just a matter of weeks.   #coronavirus #CoronaVirusUpdates #CovidSymptoms<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Burevi will be the fifth cyclone over the North Indian Ocean this year, after Amphan, Nisarga, Gati and Nivar. Fortunately, it is expected to be the least destructive of all.  #CycloneBurevi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In 1964, a powerful cyclone known as Rameswaram cyclone or Dhanushkodi cyclone swept southern Tamil Nadu in December. As per records, the storm struck Pamban Island with frightening wind speeds of more than 240 kmph.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Ockhi formed over the Bay of Bengal exactly three years ago in November 2017, passed southern Sri Lanka and skirted southernmost districts of Tamil Nadu and Kerala on November 30 and killed more than 20 people, before passing on to the Arabian Sea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Historical cyclones in the region  #CycloneBurevi brings back the memories of #CycloneOckhi for the people living around the southern tip of India.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wind gust reaching 90kmph is likely over Comorin area, Tamil Nadu coast and Kerala coast on Thursday. Damaging winds and very rough sea conditions are expected over Gulf of Mannar, along and off south Tamilnadu, Kerala, and west Sri Lanka coast.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>South Tamil Nadu and south Kerala have been kept under a ‚Äòred warning‚Äô by IMD for Thursday, while an ‚Äòorange alert‚Äô is in place for Friday. The IMD‚Äôs red warning urges residents and authorities to take action, while an orange alert recommends residents to ‚Äòbe prepared‚Äô.  #Burevi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isolated extremely heavy rainfall is likely on Thursday, while heavy to very heavy rainfall may continue over Kerala and Tamil Nadu on Friday as well.  #CycloneBurevi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The incoming cyclone could induce widespread rainfall and thunderstorms over Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Lakshadweep from Thursday to Saturday.   #CycloneBurevi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rainfall forecast  Even though #Burevi is not as strong as its predecessor, Nivar, it is likely to drench the southern states with torrential rainfall.   #CycloneBurevi  (Image credit: K. Antony Xavier / BCCL, Chennai)  https://t.co/wyztf7ttOJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Burevi is expected to pass over Tamil Nadu on Friday and gradually weaken while reaching Kerala on Friday night. The system is likely to weaken into a Deep Depression over Kerala on Friday night.  #CycloneBurevi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Weather Channel meteorologists also confirm that the Cyclone Burevi could pass over north Sri Lanka on Thursday and make landfall over Tamil Nadu coast, near Ramanathapuram on Friday early morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The storm, which lies over #SriLanka now, is expected to progress nearly west-southwestwards and cross south Tamilnadu coast between Pamban and Kanyakumari during Thursday night or early hours of Friday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Expected landfall  Burevi would be centred very close to Pamban around Wednesday noon as a cyclonic storm with a wind speed of 70-80 gusting to 90 kmph, as per the India Meteorological Department (IMD).   (Image credit: TWC Met Team)  https://t.co/1liiRPRwNe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many other parts of Karaikal, Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur, Ramanathapuram and Thanjavur also recorded more than 100 mm rainfall on Wednesday. Parts of Chennai also recorded heavy rains up to 70 mm. The capital city is likely to witness moderate rainfall over the next three days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heavy rainfall has started to impact Tamil Nadu with Vedaranyam in Nagapattinam district receiving a whopping 200 mm rainfall in the last 24 hours till Thursday morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now, the storm is approaching Tamil Nadu and has started to influence the weather over southern India.

<|startoftext|>If successful, its application could help provide oxygen during uncharted environmental #explorations in the deep seas here on #Earth, and also serve some purpose in the defence realm, like creating oxygen on-demand in submarines, for instance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An interesting thing to note is that while the brine electrolysis system worked perfectly in a simulated #Martian atmosphere at -36¬∞C, it can also be put to use effectively under typical terrestrial conditions here on #Earth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This could majorly help #astronauts live on #Mars‚Äîeven temporarily‚Äîas it would better fulfil their needs to manufacture #water on the Red Planet. Moreover, the system developed in #Ramani's lab also produces hydrogen, which could be used to fuel the #astronauts' trip back home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But now, engineers at the #McKelvey School of Engineering at Washington University in the #US have figured out a way to directly coerce oxygen and hydrogen out of briny water, which would effectively make the brine electrolysis process less complicated and less expensive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The usual method of using electricity (electrolysis) to break the H2O down into oxygen (to breathe) and hydrogen (for fuel) requires removing the salt, which would be a cumbersome and costly endeavour, especially in #Mars‚Äô harsh and dangerous environment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One such planet is #Mars,which houses abundant water content.But as the #RedPlanet is very cold,most of its water is frozen;and the water that isn‚Äôt frozen exists because its freezing temperature is lowered by the salt from the Martian soil.

<|startoftext|>Historically, eight out of ten deadliest tropical cyclones in the world have originated over the #BayofBengal.  In fact, out of the 36 most deadly tropical cyclones in the recorded history, 26 have been over this region.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Under the influence of the potential cyclone, widespread rainfall is forecast across Sri Lanka, Tamil Nadu, South Andhra Pradesh and Kerala between Tuesday and Friday with a likelihood of isolated extremely heavy rainfall on Wednesday and Thursday. I  https://t.co/aGiqgD5t7t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the system maintains its strength till then, the cyclone will linger for much longer, inducing heavy rains and strong winds across southern Tamil Nadu and Kerala.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moreover, the Cyclone Burevi is very likely to emerge again into the open seas into the Comorin area on Thursday morning, as per the IMD forecast.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The depression coupled with a cyclonic circulation is pulling away from the Nicobar Islands and currently located over the southeast Bay of Bengal. The system will progress west-northwestward toward Sri Lanka and cross the island country‚Äôs coast by Wednesday night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Burevi will be the fifth cyclone over the North Indian Ocean this year, after Amphan, Nisarga, Gati and Nivar. It is expected to be the least destructive of all if the projections hold true.  https://t.co/t4yM0bhTCq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once the system intensifies into a cyclone, it will be named ‚ÄòBurevi‚Äô as per the naming guidelines set by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO).   Unlike Nivar, Burevi may not turn into a very severe cyclone as the Bay of Bengal lacks the energy to feed the system further.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As per the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast, the system is likely to intensify into a ‚Äòdeep depression‚Äô by Monday night and further into a cyclonic storm by Tuesday morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CycloneBurevi | In less than a week after #CycloneNivar swept past Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, another cyclone started to brew over the Bay of Bengal.   The low-pressure area lingering over the Bay intensified into a depression during early hours of Monday.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>One of the most crucial steps towards this is increasing access to effective HIV prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and care.   #WorldAIDSDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The theme set for this year‚Äôs observance is ‚ÄúEnding the HIV/AIDS Epidemic: Resilience and Impact‚Äù. The theme is important for this year as the world is already battling COVID-19 pandemic and comes with a message to reinforce urgency to end HIV/AIDS globally.  #WorldAIDSDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WorldAIDSDay was first observed in 1988. The disease is a sexually transmitted disease and can be transmitted by the exchange of certain bodily fluids.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It has been estimated that the virus originated much before this first outbreak. The epicentre of the virus is believed to be Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Here the virus is believed to have jumped from chimpanzees to humans back in 1920.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was only in 1983, when the researchers from the Pasteur Institute in France identified Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) behind this rare disease of that time. The virus was originally known as the Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus or LAV.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In 2019, about 6,90,000 individuals lost their lives from HIV-related illnesses. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that about 17 lakh people have infected with the virus in 2019 itself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The annual event is marked to raise awareness on this challenging health issue with no proven cure to completely eradicate the disease till date. The disease gained global attention way back in the 1980s when its outbreak swept across the United States &amp; other parts of the globe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On December 1, the world will be joining hands to spread awareness on this disease with #WorldAIDSDay, even as the pandemic threatens to derail the progress we have made so far.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Paleontologists have now discovered a new avian creature that lived on Earth about 68 million years ago.The #fossil remains,which were unravelled in 2010 from northern #Madagascar‚Äîsituated off the southeast coast of Africa-throw light on the features of this crow-sized bird.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The discovery of this exquisite #fossil gives a twist to the evolutionary understanding of how skulls and beaks in birds changed with time.The authors of the study state that this discovery is a perfect example of how evolution can occur through different developmental pathways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the biggest challenges of the research was the fragility of the remaining skull and beak. To overcome this obstacle, the team used the technique of high-resolution imaging and digital modelling to study the bones.  #FalcatakelyForsterae<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The researchers concluded that #Falcatakely belongs to an extinct family of birds known as #Enantiornithines.The other thing researchers stumbled across was a preserved tooth,found on the tip of the snout. It is likely, the bird may have had more teeth, which were not preserved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #fossils gives a similar resemblance to that of modern-day #toucans and #hornbills.The study notes that the bird‚Äôs anatomy was quite surprising as the underlying face skeleton looked nothing like the modern creatures, irrespective to the similarity to face.  (üì∏: Mark Witton)  https://t.co/UZHyFog2Sq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Though the #fossil is only of the front half of a skull, researchers affirm that it's very unique. The specimen showcases that its sickle-like beak has never been documented before for a bird of this era.   #FalcatakelyForsterae<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The newly-discovered bird is dubbed as Falcatakely forsterae and measures 3.5 inches. It is known to be the second bird species from the #MesozoicEra discovered in #Madagascar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By decoding the remains,the team noted that the birds lived along with #Dinosaurs in the #MesozoicEra.The fossils offer a glimpse on the wide diversity of birds which lived in that era and also reveal insights on how the face and beak of various bird species evolved over time.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Subsequently, a genetic analysis of these worms revealed "subtle changes" in about 1,000 genes. Stronger effects were observed in some of the genes, especially among neurons (the nervous system cells).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...how living in low gravity can affect our cells at the genetic level‚Äîand it has done so using worms!  The research by the University of Exeter and the NASA GeneLab, took some Caenorhabditis elegans worms to the @Space_Station and exposed them to low gravity conditions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sixty years later, members of this species now spend months in such weightless conditions. Ever wondered how their genes are affected as they adjust to this new normal?  While it has been known that human beings suffer a physical decline in space, a new study has now found...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine an organism that has habituated to carrying 50 to 80 kgs of weight throughout its life and has evolved over millions of years doing just that.   Suddenly, one day a member of the species flies off to a new world with no weight pushing him down.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The glowing species has been named as Roridomyces phyllostachydis after its host bamboo tree‚ÄîPhyllostachys‚Äîwhere it was found growing. As per reports, out of 1,20,000 species of fungi discovered so far, about 100 are bioluminescent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As per the study, the species belongs to the genus of Roridomyces, which usually grow in moist and humid conditions. This makes it the first #fungus‚Äîunder this genus‚Äîto be discovered from India.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Researchers concluded that the discovered species is a new one after examining its morphological and molecular data. For this, the team extracted the #mushroom‚Äôs DNA and sequenced the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and the nuclear ribosomal large subunit (LSU) of the fungus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>During this project, the team documented 600 varieties of fungi, in addition to finding new species. It was detected during the last leg of the project, from two sites namely Mawlynnong in East Khasi Hills district and Krang Shuri in West Jaintia Hills district.  https://t.co/MdwAt5AMAH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Identification of the species  The species were identified by a team of scientists on a project to assess fungal biodiversity of the Northeastern states‚ÄîAssam, Meghalaya, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As per the study, this ability to emit bright light‚Äîtypically green‚Äîis one of the most common activities of ocean living animals, as compared to the terrestrial ones. Among all, fireflies are the most common and popular insects, which hone this ability on land.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Several theories have been floating around on why the fungus glows, and why only one particular part turns luminescent. One theory suggests that the fungi glow to attract insects for spore dispersal or to protect themselves from being eaten by #frugivorous animals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>During this chemical reaction, excess energy is released in the form of light, which in turn makes the stalk glow. Why does just one part of the mushroom glow? Researchers acknowledge that it's still a mystery.  https://t.co/dB6CQ6rZHv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the case of the stalk, the enzyme named luciferase is responsible for the mushroom's luminescent glow. As per the study, the green light is released when compound luciferans is catalysed by an enzyme.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do these mushrooms glow?üçÑ  The captivating glow of the mushrooms was found only in the stipes or stalk part, while caps or pileus showcased (sadly) no colour change in the dark.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The new #mushrooms were first spotted in 2019 during the fungi biodiversity survey. As per reports, the species have now been added to the count of 97 known existing bioluminescent species worldwide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A team of scientists-from India, China-discovered a new species of mushroom thriving in the bamboo forest of Northeast India. Eerily though, these fungi species glow in the dark!

<|startoftext|>Two, the sea surface temperature is in the range of 29-30¬∞C‚Äîideal for the moist, warm air currents to feed the system further.   #CycloneNivar #CycloneNivarUpdate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Favourable conditions  Two seasonal factors have remained favourable for rapid intensification of #CycloneNivar so far. One, the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is in a favourable phase that enhances the formation of rain-bearing clouds.  #CycloneNivarUpdate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Major damage to power and communication lines, kutcha and pakka roads, trees, horticulture and coastal crops, and embankments/salt pans is also to be expected.  #CycloneNivar #CycloneNivarUpdate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Owing to the #heavyrainfall, intense thunderstorms, and strong winds, there is a high possibility of thatched houses and huts getting damaged, and rooftops and unattached metal sheets being blown off and away.   #CycloneNivar #CycloneNivarUpdate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Storm force wind is expected in #Puducherry on Wednesday night, but the intensity drops substantially after landfall as the moisture and heat from the ocean stop feeding the system.  (Image credit: L R Shankar / BCCL, Chennai)  https://t.co/I7D6cZ9rKV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Other projected impacts  Gale force wind is expected along the coast of #TamilNadu and Puducherry from Wednesday morning to Thursday before dawn, and over inland in northern Tamil Nadu from Wednesday late night to Thursday early morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Despite being very far from the estimated landing point of the cyclone, southern Andhra districts and Rayalaseema region may witness accumulated precipitation of around 200 mm within 24 hrs on Thursday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#IMD‚Äôs red warning signifies ‚Äòtake action‚Äô, while orange alert means ‚Äòbe prepared‚Äô for adverse weather conditions.  The TWC Met team highlights that strong easterly winds from the Bay of Bengal will cause torrential rain in southern Andhra Pradesh on Thursday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Accordingly, #IMD has placed coastal and north interior #TamilNadu, #Puducherry and #Karaikal under ‚Äòred warning‚Äô for Wednesday and Rayalaseema for Thursday. All the other aforementioned regions are under an ‚Äòorange alert‚Äô for the next two days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In fact, #heavyrainfall has started in many parts of Tamil Nadu already, with the capital Chennai witnessing more than 70 mm rains within 9 hours from Tuesday morning to evening.  (Image credit: TWC Met Team)  https://t.co/gtjPKh2CZM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rainfall and flooding possibility  The IMD has forecast isolated extremely heavy rainfall activity over coastal and north interior Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, southern Andhra Pradesh, Rayalaseema and Telangana on Wednesday and Thursday.   #CycloneNivar #CycloneNivarUpdate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) projects landfall in Puducherry at around 9:30 pm on Wednesday, while the European model ECMWF puts landfall around Mamallapuram and Kalpakkam at 2:30 am on Thursday.  #CycloneNivar #CycloneNivarUpdate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Other Numerical Weather Prediction models forecast landing times much earlier, similar to that of IMD GFS.   #CycloneNivar #CycloneNivarUpdate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to the US Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), Cyclone Nivar will travel northwest while developing to the strength of Very Severe Cyclonic Storm (VSCS) on Thursday dawn.   #CycloneNivar #CycloneNivarUpdate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>However, different model projections still show a significant deviation in the trajectory of the storm.  #CycloneNivar #CycloneNivarUpdate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Landfall forecast  As per the current forecasts from the India Meteorological Department (IMD), #CycloneNivar is very likely to cross Puducherry coast on Wednesday late evening as a very severe cyclonic storm with a wind speed of 120-130 kmph gusting to 145 kmph.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This week, Cyclone Nivar is barrelling towards Tamil Nadu gathering more and more strength than projected earlier. As on Tuesday night, Nivar is 350 km away from Puducherry and is approaching a wind speed of 100 kmph.  #CycloneNivar #CycloneNivarUpdate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CycloneGati, which formed over the Arabian Sea last week, intensified from a wind speed of 60 kmph to 180+ kmph in just 12 hours, making it the first very severe storm to hit Somalia in recorded history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The growing intensity and frequency of cyclonic storms over the North Indian Ocean have been a cause of concern flagged by several researchers as a consequence of warming planet.   #CycloneNivar #CycloneNivarUpdate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wednesday, November 25, 02:00 am: In 25 years from 1991 to 2015, Tamil Nadu witnessed five cyclones of ‚Äòvery severe‚Äô intensity, while in just five years, the state is set to witness the fourth storm of such intensity striking its coasts.   #CycloneNivar #CycloneNivarUpdate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>IMD's regional met department in New Delhi has predicted that Keylong‚Äîthe administrative centre of Lahaul-Spiti‚Äîwill continue to experience maximum temperatures around 5-9¬∞C in the coming days, while the minimum temperatures will drop down to as low as -2¬∞C.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With fresh #snowfall and prevalence of cold winter conditions in major parts of Himachal Pradesh, the spread of the disease has become a matter of greater concern.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The snowfall spell was brought about this week by the season‚Äôs first western disturbance‚Äîlow-pressure systems that originate over the Mediterranean Sea and travel all the way to India, influencing the weather across northern India during the winter season from December-February.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the midst of this #COVID19 spike, several high-altitude areas in districts like Lahaul and Spiti, Chamba, Mandi, Kullu, and Kinnaur have started to experience snowfall and chilling temperatures as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As for #HimachalPradesh, the state has collectively registered some 32,197 confirmed cases as of Thursday, November 19.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Owing to the sudden spike in the cases, the local administration closed several tourist spots in Lahaul on Thursday. Moreover, the administration has also restricted tourist movement to Teling nullah near the north portal of the Rohtang tunnel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many of them migrate to the nearby areas during the peak winter months. A Times of India report has revealed that all villagers voluntarily decided to get their COVID-19 tests done, and when the results came back, 41 of them were declared positive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As per reports, some people residing in the neighbouring areas of the village have also tested positive.  According to the officials, Thorang village, which is based along the Manali-Leh highway, has just 42 residents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The outbreak in this particular village is a result of a religious gathering program which took place a few days ago. It contributed to the quick spread of the virus in the not-so populated village.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only resident that has not gotten infected with the lethal virus is 52-year-old Bhushan Thakur, despite five of his family members testing positive for #COVID19.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All residents of the Thorang Village, located in Lahaul-Spiti district of Himachal Pradesh, have tested positive for #COVID19‚Äîbarring just one citizen. With the sudden spread, the #LahaulValley has become the worst impacted district of the north Indian state.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The study‚Äôs estimates suggest that this alarming ice loss can increase sea levels anywhere between 2 cm to 10 cm by the end of this century which, and in turn, can have a huge impact on the ocean current, aquatic lives, and the environment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the studies published recently in the journal Nature revealed that the Greenland ice sheet‚Äîsituated between the Arctic and the North Atlantic Ocean‚Äîis losing mass at an unprecedented rate, having recorded the highest melting in recent years than in the past 12,000 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But over the last two decades, the ice sheets which largely cover Greenland and Antarctica have become another source of global sea-level rise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As per the study, until 2000, the main reason for the sea-level rise was attributed to melting glaciers and the expansion of the ocean water.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The impact of sea-level rise can be severe as it can impact the lives of nearly 287 million people due to flooding. Moreover, the United Nations scientific body, the IPCC, projects that the global sea-level rise could be between 30-110 centimetres by 2100.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The research paper adds, ‚ÄúRCP8.5 implies an additional global temperature increase of 3.7‚Äâ¬∞C by 2100, approximately four times larger than that which has taken place since 1880.‚Äù<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Projected rise in sea-level  Based on the scenario named Representative Concentration Pathways Model or RCP 8.5, the study project that the future sea-level rise from these #glaciers can be noted at 9.1‚Äì14.9 mm by 2100.   (üì∏: NASA/Operation IceBrige)  https://t.co/7usiUGt5xb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Combined, the ice melt from these three sources has already contributed to the rise of sea levels by 8 mm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kangerlussuaq‚Äîsituated on the east coast‚Äîlost 1.4 trillion tonnes of ice chunk in-between years 1900-2012, while Helheim glacier has lost 31 billion tonnes of ice in the same period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After studying various datasets, the team found, Jakobshavn Isbrae‚Äîsituated in west #Greenland‚Äîlost a total of 1.5 trillion tonnes of ice in the past 132 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The team used various sets of data derived from historical photographs, recent satellite images, and aerial stereo-photogrammetric imagery to calculate the ice loss between 1880‚Äì2012.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unprecedented melting between 1880-2012  For the study, researchers examined three largest glaciers of Greenland in particular, namely Jakobshavn Isbrae, Kangerlussuaq Glacier and Helheim Glaciers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Together, the three #glaciers hold enough ice to increase the global sea level by at least 1.3 metres if melted. Such an extent of sea-level rise could inundate several major coastal cities like Mumbai and Chennai.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (@IUCN) has listed Giraffes as a vulnerable species on its Red List. At present, the tallest animal of the world has a global population of 68,293 individuals.  #WhiteGiraffe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AWF states that poaching and wildlife trafficking continues to contribute to a significant decline in African wildlife.  #WhiteGiraffe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Giraffes are usually hunted by poachers for hides, meat and body parts. As per the Africa Wildlife Foundation (@AWF_Official), in the last 30 years around 40% of the population has disappeared from 15 #African countries.   #WhiteGiraffe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The white colour of this unique giraffe is due to the condition known as leucism. It is a genetic condition where the animal's skin cells lack the ability to form colour pigments. In this condition, they produce dark pigment in their soft tissues.  #WhiteGiraffe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Earlier in March this year, poachers killed two of his family members, leaving behind only one giraffe. The white giraffe was first discovered in 2017 along with its calf. She gave birth to another calf in August last year.  #WhiteGiraffe<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Scientists say we can't blame the freakish weather on 2020.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are also indications that climate change is making hurricanes more likely to slow down.  Warmer water fuels hurricanes and recent research has linked climate change to storms that are more intense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rising sea levels driven by warmer ocean temperatures that cause water to expand, as well as increased melting of glaciers and ice sheets, are projected to make disasters like flooding and hurricanes worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Global temperatures have warmed an average of 2 degrees over the past century, according to NOAA. From 1900 to 1980, a new temperature record was typically set every 13.5 years.   Since 1981, a new record's been set every three years.<|endoftext|>

This tied 1995 for the most such rapid intensifiers in any single season since 1979, according to Tomer Burg, an atmospheric science Ph.D. student at the University of Oklahoma.  https://t.co/phUE0QXvpS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Potentially Catastrophic Impacts Again  Eta's flooding impacts killed at least 120 in Central America and southern Mexico. Scores of people are still missing, the AP said. Honduras was one of the areas hardest hit by Eta's flooding and any additional rain could worsen conditions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Regardless, Iota is likely to be a catastrophic hurricane for Central America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Iota is taking a path very similar to #HurricaneEta when it made its Category 4 landfall on November 3.  If Iota makes landfall at Category 5 intensity, it would join only 18 other hurricanes that have done so in the Atlantic Basin since 1924.  https://t.co/IsAzxpBQq9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Video posted in social media showed roofs being ripped off some homes and buildings in Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, near the track of Iota's eyewall. Winds gusted to 81 mph at the Puerto Cabezas Airport Monday evening, as the eyewall drew nearer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hurricane warnings were issued for portions of Nicaragua and Honduras. Tropical storm warnings extended to the west and south of the hurricane warnings in both of those countries.  #HurricaneIota<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The upgrade to Category 5 intensity was based on both satellite intensity estimates and a Hurricane Hunter mission, which measured flight level and surface winds sufficiently strong enough.  https://t.co/iTj5SEyvyE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Late Monday morning, Iota became only the second Category 5 hurricane on record in November and the record latest-in-season hurricane ever to reach that intensity in the Atlantic Basin. The 1932 Cuba hurricane reached Category 5 intensity from November 5-8.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hurricane Iota is likely to bring torrential rainfall, flooding, mudslides, storm surge and damaging winds for the second time in two weeks to parts of Central America still recovering from #HurricaneEta in early November.  #HurricaneIota<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The unusually active hurricane season over the Atlantic Basin has churned out yet another catastrophic storm this week.   #HurricaneIota<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#HurricaneIota to Hit Central America as Second Catastrophic Strike in Two Weeks  - Iota has intensified into a Category 5  - It is the second intense hurricane in 2 weeks to strike Central America. - Flooding, storm surge, destructive winds are expected.   https://t.co/AG4zRq7Jmb  https://t.co/ynSwKORyRF<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>All in all, a complete shift from firecrackers to traditional diyas is the only way to ensure avoid worsening the air quality and reduce risks to people with heart diseases, respiratory disorders, and the ongoing, far-from-finished threat of #COVID19.   #ScienceSherlock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Therefore, #ScienceSherlock insists that if your aim is to celebrate #Diwali without causing any pollution and harming the environment, bursting of crackers‚Äîeven the green ones, which are essentially the lesser of two evils‚Äîmust also be completely avoided.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This very fact makes their name misleading too‚Äîthese crackers aren‚Äôt completely ‚Äògreen‚Äô and environment-friendly; instead, they fall in the ‚Äògrey zone‚Äô.  #ScienceSherlock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As evident from these three subtypes, green crackers emit at least 30% lesser pollutants than their commercial counterparts, effectively lowering their contribution to air pollution. But make no mistake: the usage of these crackers does cause #pollution.   #ScienceSherlock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ScienceSherlock: This led to the creation of SAFAL, which emits at least 35-40% less particulate matter compared to the conventional formulation, all the while matching the 110-115 dBA sound created by commercial crackers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Therefore, researchers have since minimised the usage of aluminium, restricting it just for the initiation of flash powder ignition, and using magnesium for the subsequent sound and light effects.   #ScienceSherlock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3. Safe Minimal Aluminum Crackers (SAFAL): When traditional firecrackers are burned, the aluminium used in them becomes a critical source of pollution.   #ScienceSherlock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2. Safe Thermite Crackers (STAR): This formulation lowers the usage of thermite, which is used as fuel in traditional fireworks, thereby bringing down the expulsion of particulate matter by about 30%.   #ScienceSherlock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They do not consist of potassium nitrate or sulphur, which consequently prevents the emission of SO2 and NOx, and reduces the ejection of particulate matter by about 30-35%.  #ScienceSherlock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1. Safe Water Releasers (SWAS): SWAS are a very novel formulation of fireworks that emit water vapour when exploding, and the vapour leads to the suppression and dilution of suspended dust particles.   #ScienceSherlock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Following the Supreme Court orders, scientists working with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) have developed a wide range of green crackers‚Äîfrom flower pots to ‚Äòatom bombs‚Äô‚Äîwhich cause much lesser #airpollution post-combustion.   #ScienceSherlock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They should emit 30-35% less particulate matter as compared to conventional firecrackers.  #ScienceSherlock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They must not use traditional ingredients like antimony, lithium, mercury, arsenic, lead, barium oxides, and potassium oxides in any form during the manufacturing process.  #ScienceSherlock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They should not use barium nitrate or potassium nitrate as oxidisers (components that produce oxygen to help crackers burn).  They must avoid using ash as a desiccant (a hygroscopic substance used as a drying agent to keep the crackers from getting moist) or filler materials.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is important to understand what green crackers actually are. While the concept of a ‚Äògreen cracker‚Äô continues to evolve, the directions found in Supreme Court rulings require firecrackers to comply with the following rules to be categorised as ‚Äògreen‚Äô.  #ScienceSherlock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Instead, only green crackers will be sold, and that too in cities and towns where the #airquality is at least ‚Äòmoderate‚Äô.  #ScienceSherlock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The ban on firecrackers will also be applicable to all Indian cities and towns where the average ambient air quality in November last year was ‚Äòpoor‚Äô or worse.   #ScienceSherlock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To prevent this detrimental fate from unfolding, particularly in the view of the ongoing surge of #COVID19 cases, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has imposed a total ban on the sale and use of #firecrackers in Delhi and adjoining areas from November 9 to 30.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Considered one of the inseparable parts of the modern-day Diwali, firecrackers are likely to add to the local pollutants and stubble smoke from surrounding areas, effectively transforming the landlocked capital into a virtual gas chamber.  #ScienceSherlock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The pollution season in Delhi has begun intensifying much earlier than usual this year, with the capital getting its first taste of emergency-level #AirQuality at the very start of November 2020.  #ScienceSherlock<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Other late-stage vaccines are being developed by Moderna Inc and Johnson &amp; Johnson. Meanwhile, India‚Äôs indigenous #COVAXIN, developed by Bharat Biotech with the government-run Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), may also be available by February 2021.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AstraZeneca's vaccine, originally developed by the Oxford University, is currently undergoing trials in India in partnership with Serum Institute of India (@SerumInstIndia).   #coronavirusvaccine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Other vaccines in the league  At present, around 10 vaccine candidates are in their late testing stages globally. This list includes Britain's #AstraZeneca, which is expected to roll out in late December or early 2021.   #coronavirus #CovidVaccine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The box‚Äîthe size of a suitcase‚Äîcan store up to 5,000 doses of the vaccine under the right temperature settings for 10 days. Nevertheless, storage of this vaccine candidate remains a major challenge.  #coronavirus #CovidVaccine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To address this issue, the US giant has reportedly developed a special transport box supported with dry ice and GPS trackers to deliver vaccines to designated places.   #coronavirus #CovidVaccine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most of the hospitals have storage facilities with a temperature of -2 to -8 degrees Celsius. Other COVID-19 vaccine candidates of companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson and Novavax Inc can very well be stored at this temperature range.  #coronavirus #CovidVaccine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Recently, the World Health Organisation (WHO) also acknowledged this concern, especially for warm countries like Asia and Africa.   #coronavirus #CovidVaccine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moreover, an average freezer will also not be a suitable place for vaccine storage. This isn‚Äôt an issue with most other vaccines, as they do not require such low temperature storing facilities.  #coronavirus #PfizerVaccine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The vaccine candidate has to be stored at a temperature of -70 degrees Celsius‚Äîequivalent to an Antarctic winter. Without an extremely cold storage system, it may become ineffective within two days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Main challenges ahead  The companies have achieved one of the biggest milestones in the trials, but some of the other main hurdles still need to be addressed in safe delivery.  #coronavirus #PfizerVaccine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now, the two companies are working towards achieving success in the following three areas: evidence of efficacy in most vaccinated patients, evidence of safety with data from thousands of patients, and manufacturing consistently at the highest quality standards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Based on current projections, the companies expect to produce up to 50 million vaccine doses globally in 2020, and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021. The data from the full Phase 3 trial is slated to be published in a scientific peer-review journal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moreover, the current results indicate that protection from the virus was achieved in just 28 days after the initiation of the immunisation‚Äîwhich consisted of a 2-dose schedule. The phase 3 clinical trial of the vaccine candidate began on  #coronavirus @pfizer #PfizerVaccine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The official statement of @pfizer reveals the study enrolled 43,538 participants, with 42% having diverse backgrounds. As per the late-stage analysis, no serious safety concerns were reported.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The current results of the trials  In the first interim efficacy analysis, the vaccine demonstrated an efficacy of 90% in preventing #COVID19 in participants that had no prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.   #coronavirus #COVIDVaccine #PfizerVaccine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Experts state that mRNA-based vaccines are faster and cheaper to develop as compared to traditional vaccines, which require the virus to be cultivated and replicated. TThe vaccine is currently in its Phase 3 human trials.  #coronavirus #COVIDVaccine #PfizerVaccine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once it is injected into the human body, it instructs the cells to create copies of spike protein which, in turn, prompts the immune cells to generate antibodies to fight the infection.  #coronavirus #COVIDVaccine #PfizerVaccine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The vaccine works by introducing an mRNA sequence‚Äîthe molecule which instructs the cell on what to code. The mRNA in the vaccine is coded to recreate the spike protein of the novel coronavirus.   #coronavirus #COVIDVaccine #PfizerVaccine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the meantime, here‚Äôs everything you need to know about the Pfizer and BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine candidate.  What is the #PfizerVaccine candidate?  The candidate, named 'BNT162b2', is an mRNA-based vaccine. This type of vaccine uses genetic codes to induce an immune response.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As per reports, the vaccine will be reviewed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by the end of this month. The vaccine may also end up receiving an emergency authorisation.  #coronavirus #COVIDVaccine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dr Bellur S. Prabhakar, Associate Dean and Professor at the University of Illinois, Chicago, USA told The Weather Channel: "Initial data indicates that the short term protection is robust. However, the longer term protection that the vaccine can confer is yet to be determined.‚Äù<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üíâThe hopes of seeing the ongoing #COVID19 health crisis come to an end have slightly grown thanks to the major achievement by pharmaceutical giants Pfizer and BioNTech, who announced earlier this week that their vaccine candidate has been found to be 90% effective.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Delhi's air quality index stood at 344 micrograms per cubic metre at noon, as against 476 a day before. The city recorded severe category air quality for six consecutive days due to an increase in stubble burning and unfavourable wind speed.  #PollutionWatch #AirQuality<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PollutionWatch: Biomass burning in Delhi and other NCR towns will also be strictly checked, the CPCB said. Implementing agencies have also been asked to ensure compliance of orders of courts and the National Green Tribunal regarding banning of sale and use of #firecrackers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Besides this, the states of Punjab and Haryana must take immediate stringent actions to curb stubble burning. According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences, stubble burning share in PM2.5 in Delhi's air was 3 percent on Wednesday as against 42 percent on November 5.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moreover, the frequency of mechanised cleaning of roads and water sprinkling has also asked to be increased, particularly on the road stretches with high dust generation potential.  #PollutionWatch #AirQuality #AirQualityIndex<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Moreover, they may also send specific payloads to particularly detect and confirm the glow on its dark side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The researchers are further aiming to demystify the properties of ice beneath the dark side of the moon through the upcoming mission like the Europa Clipper, which is dedicated to unravelling the properties of Europa‚Äôs oceans through multiple flybys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The study highlights the possibility that the energetic electrons bombarded by Jupiter penetrate the icy surface of Europa, and further energise the molecules beneath. As soon as these molecules calm down, they release energy, which is visible in the form of a glow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These salts include magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt) and sodium chloride. The lab-based experiment showcases that adding those salts into water ice and blasting it with radiation produces a glow on ice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An earlier study by #NASA had revealed the presence of sodium chloride (table salt) compounds on Europa. Taking a cue from this, the team hypothesized that Europa‚Äôs surface may contain common salts, and in addition to the ice, they help the moon glow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scientists suspect that there should be some specific chemical molecules under the icy surface which make it capture the radiation from Jupiter and produce the glow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glowing in the dark  Earth‚Äôs Moon doesn‚Äôt produce its own light and shines brightly at night only by reflecting the sunlight and that reflection goes through the phases. Unlike this, Europa shines through the night due to the presence of electrons blasted by Jupiter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As per the official statement from NASA, till now most of the observation was done on the dayside of the Europa. But this study indicates how the dark side of the moon may illuminate.  (Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech)  https://t.co/i9wvEKPVq7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the study, researchers conducted a laboratory simulation to find how irradiated ice gives out green light. The researchers used the technique of spectrometer, which enables separation of light of different wavelengths and reveals the composition of the material.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To the naked eyes, the glow might actually appear slightly green or blue and these colours may appear to vary based on the brightness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The high energy radiations continuously bombard the icy surface with electrons day and night, and interact with the molecules present beneath and brighten the ice scattered on its surface.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Deciphering #Europa‚Äôs glow  Through the lab-based experiments, the team from JPL determined how this glow will actually look like. As per the authors of the study, this glow is due to the high level of radiation emitted by Jupiter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The study, conducted by scientists from the US space agency NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Southern California, can further help shed light on the compositions of ice on Europa‚Äôs surface.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now, scientists have found that the ice-covered in its surface may actually glow in the dark‚Äîgiving #Europa a perky look.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Europa‚Äîone of Jupiter‚Äôs 79 moons‚Äîhas already shown glimmers of its potential to support life. Scientists have already deciphered that beneath its frozen crust there is a vast ocean, which could host some form of life.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>With #COVID19 caseload worsening and #AQI levels further deteriorating, over-crowded main markets can be extremely risky.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The aggregate views of citizens suggest that 36 per cent residents of Delhi-NCR plan to visit markets and malls for Diwali shopping. Last weekend, many of the main markets saw over-crowding situations with no #socialdistancing and near zero enforcement to #COVID19 protocols.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Given the #AQI and #COVID19 daily caseload, the survey tried to understand citizens' plans if they'd visit the local market, main market, mall for festive shopping, or would they opt for home delivery from retail or local stores, or shop online for Diwali celebrations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meanwhile, the NGT earlier this week has banned all kinds of firecrackers between November 7 and 30 in cities with "poor" or worse air quality across the country, aimed to reduce pollution levels during the festive season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a positive sentiment among the respondents from Delhi-NCR as the majority have planned to lesser their social visit come Diwali, or would just stay home and celebrate the occasion with close family and not visit nor host any gathering.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The aggregate views of citizens suggest that only 25 per cent of residents of Delhi-NCR will socialise this Diwali given the double-threat posed by air pollution and the likelihood of getting infected with #COVID19 on the present #airquality conditions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Residents of Delhi and NCR typically meet their friends and extended family before and after Diwali. Many #Diwali parties also take place during this period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The second question in the survey has tried to understand the perception of Delhi-NCR citizens if they'd socialise during Diwali.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On October 15, 2020, LocalCircles published the findings of a survey that said 65 per cent households in Delhi have one or more individuals who have started experiencing pollution-related ailments.  #pollutionwatch #airquality #airpollution<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The aggregate views of citizens suggest that 73 per cent households of Delhi-NCR now have one or more individuals suffering from pollution-related ailments like cough, cold, sore throat, headache, burning eyes, and difficulty in breathing.  #pollutionwatch #airquality<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meanwhile, only 13 per cent households in Delhi, 13 per cent in Gurugram, 19 per cent in Noida, 19 per cent in Ghaziabad, and 17 per cent in Faridabad said "no members of the family have any of the above and are doing fine".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of which, 85 per cent households in Delhi, 62 per cent in Gurugram, 68 per cent in Noida, 43 per cent in Ghaziabad, and 66 per cent in Faridabad said "either 1 or more individuals are suffering from pollution-related ailments".  #pollutionwatch #airquality #airpollution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About 5,965 responses from Delhi, 1,544 from Gurugram, 1,514 from Noida, 1,357 from Ghaziabad and 1,441 from Faridabad were received.   #pollutionwatch #airquality #airpollution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The first question asked citizens, "With Delhi-NCR air quality having deteriorated by 1,000% in the last 6 weeks and AQI now in the 500-700 range, what are you and your family experiencing?."  #pollutionwatch #airquality #airpollution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>'LocalCircles' conducted a survey to find the aggregate percentage of households in Delhi-NCR having one or more individuals facing pollution-related health ailments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to the public health experts, #smog-related health hazards such as cough, cold, sore throat, burning eyes and difficulty in breathing can lead to short-and long-term ailments such as aggravating respiratory and cardiovascular problems, and even lung cancer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The national capital has been recording severe category air quality since the last six days. Delhi's #airqualityindex stood at 467 micrograms per cubic metre at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, almost touching the hazardous category.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The results of this study act as quantitative data for policy measures that aim to cap the land for agriculture‚Äîby sustainably increasing the yield, stabilising population growth, and encouraging dietary shifts towards eating less meat.  #ClimateChange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Further, with further increase in carbon emission, the situation of habitat loss will become even worse.  #ClimateChange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Check on #climatechange, land conversion necessary  As per the results of the study, increasing climate change‚Äîespecially global warming and change in patterns of rainfall‚Äîwill only have an increasing effect on the geographical ranges of these species.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Tropics are known for their richness in species, but the natural range of these species is small. And as humans are expanding their activities here, the impact on the species‚Äô range is also becoming large at disproportionate amounts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since then, huge areas in the tropics have been converted for agriculture‚Äîfor example, the rainforests in Southeast Asia for oil palm plantation and for pasture lands in South America.   #ClimateChange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The reduction of habitats in recent times has been significant in tropical areas. Till 50 years ago, most of the world‚Äôs agricultural developments were in North America and Europe.   #ClimateChange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To protect these species in a better manner, we need to have a better understanding of the evolution of the geographical ranges in the past and different scenarios of how they might change in the future.  #ClimateChange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Habitat reduction leads to higher risk of extinction  All functions of the ecosystem, ranging from the minute to magnanimous, are supported by the presence of a diverse variety of species. The geographical range of a species impacts its sensitivity to extinction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>However, around 16% of species have already lost more than half of their natural historical range, and it is worrisome that the percentage may rise to as much as 26% by 2100.   #ClimateChange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Their overall impact is unequal among the species, with some species getting affected more than the others.   #ClimateChange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agriculture, urban activities‚Äîthreat to geographical ranges  According to Dr. Robert Beyer from the University of Cambridge's Department of Zoology, first author of the study, the size of habitats of all the birds, mammals and amphibians that we know is reducing.   #ClimateChange<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Although this report and other recent data on public #COVID19 commitments indicate that the already slow progress on phasing out fossil fuel funding has now been thrown into reverse, researchers say there are upcoming opportunities for governments to turn the tide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saudi Arabia also continues to heavily support oil and gas production and fossil fuel-based power, mostly through large state-owned enterprise expenditures and low consumer energy prices, said the report.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the other end of the spectrum, the UK and Turkey rank poorly due to a lack of transparency and large subsidies for fossil fuel use, while Mexico was docked for heavy support for oil and gas production and fossil fuel-based power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brazil's relatively good performance was tied to low support for coal production, fossil fuel-based power and consumption, and a reduction in state-owned enterprise investment in fossils. "However, new measures under consideration could soon reverse this progress," Geddes said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Out of the non-OECD G20 countries, Brazil scored highest while Saudi Arabia came in last. Top scorer Germany got points for transparency, strong commitments, and relatively lower support for oil and gas production and fossil fuel use.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Among the G20 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) members, Germany performed best overall in terms of phasing out fossil fuel funding, while Mexico, Turkey, and the UK ranked equally lowest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In most countries assessed, the progress made during the last three years was described by experts as "poor" or "very poor," and no country was considered to have made "good progress" in line with reaching Paris Agreement goals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They looked at seven indicators: transparency, pledges, public money for coal, oil and gas, fossil fuel-based power (both production and consumption), as well as how support has changed over time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"In Doubling Back and Doubling Down", researchers considered recent COVID-19 recovery commitments as well as pre-#pandemic policies to rank G20 countries' progress in phasing out support to fossil fuels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to the latest data from the Energy Policy Tracker, G20 governments have given at least $233 billion in additional support through recovery measures to fossil fuel-intensive sectors since the pandemic began.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Despite repeated pledges to end inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, #G20 governments' support to fossil fuels has dropped by only nine percent since 2014-2016, hitting $584 billion annually over the last three years, a report by international researchers said on Tuesday.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The #MilkyWay galaxy consists of 40,000 crore stars, and out of these, about seven per cent, i.e. around 2,800 crore stars, are G-type like the Sun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While 30 crore forms the most conservative estimate, research from the University of British Columbia has earlier shown that there may be more than 500 crore Earth-like planets present in our Milky Way galaxy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But the conservative estimate highlights that the occurrence rate of such planets is 50%, meaning half of the Sun-like stars have rocky planets capable of hosting water. That‚Äôs roughly 30 crore planets in the Milky Way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The researchers are still trying to decode the exact effect of the star‚Äôs energy on the planet and the formation of liquid water.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The data obtained from Gaia was significant in understanding the amount of energy emitted by a host star and how much of it is received by the orbiting planet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These calculations were done through the help of a final dataset of planetary signals obtained through Kepler along with the data about each star‚Äôs energy output collected by the European Space Agency's Gaia mission.  (Image credit: ESO/M. Kornmesser/NASA)  https://t.co/1AhVWA1mCg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They further narrowed down the planets that are mostly rocky and orbiting stars of age and temperature similar to that of our Sun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finding habitable worlds  Astronomers confined their search to exoplanets between a radius of 0.5 and 1.5 times than that of our planet to sharpen the study focus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To hunt for habitable planets, space scientists usually look at three main parameters, which includes being rocky, orbiting a star similar to the Sun, and the hosting conditions viable to keep water in the liquid state.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>During the nine years journey, Kepler identified 4,034 candidate exoplanets with a potential of being habitable worlds, but later out of these only 2,300 were actually validated. The telescope also revealed that there are billions of planets in our galaxy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The mission was retired by @NASA in 2018‚Äîafter it ran out of fuel‚Äîbut it left behind a legacy of rich space data.  (Image credit: NASA)  https://t.co/dZ5bEDOR19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The planet hunter mission  The significant details of the new study come from the remarkable Kepler Space telescope, which played a crucial role in investigating the presence of planets in our home galaxy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moreover, as per #NASA‚Äôs estimates, at least four habitable planets may be located just 30 light-years of our Sun, and the closest Earth-like world is likely to be at most about 20 light-years from us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The planet must also be orbiting at the 'Goldilocks‚Äô distance‚Äîpositioned in the habitable zone around the star‚Äîin order to be able to host liquid water, and potentially life, on its surface.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For starters, an #Earth-like planet is essentially any planet that is rocky, roughly the same size as the Earth, and orbiting a G-type star‚Äîoften called a yellow dwarf star‚Äîlike the Sun.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Researchers now have acquired data from the #SpitzerSpaceTelescope and are hopeful that it may help them with confirmation of the day-side and night-side temperatures of the exoplanet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The teams are further working to test if these extreme weather predictions are correct, and the #JamesWebbSpaceTelescope scheduled to launch in 2021 is likely to help them do that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The mineral vapour precipitates in the frigid atmosphere on the night side of the planet and ‚Äòrains‚Äô back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Due to the extreme temperatures, rocks on the surface of this planet evaporate and are moved to the dark side of the planet by the supersonic winds that rage over 5,000 km/hr.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Planet where rock ‚Äòrains‚Äô  The simulation threw up projections of a scarier world as it revealed that the planet‚Äôs magma ocean is about 100 km deep. Similar to how the Earth witnessed the water cycle, this exoplanet has its own rock cycle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For these predictions of K2-141b, scientists used computer simulation techniques. Through this, they were able to paint the picture of a lava planet like never before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moreover, the predictions state that one side experiences windy weather, whereas, the other is totally devoid of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This #exoplanet is nearly the size of our Earth and everything is composed mainly of rocky elements like sodium, silicon monoxide, and silicon dioxide. Interestingly, the darker side of the planet experiences frigid temperatures dropping below -200¬∞C with never-ending darkness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The sunlit side of the planet witnessed extreme temperatures of whopping 3000¬∞C‚Äîhot enough to melt and vaporize rocks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As the planet is situated very close to its scorching star, one hemisphere faces heat throughout the orbit, making a total of two-third area of K2-141b sun-lit all the time. This happens because the exoplanet is gravitationally locked, making one side always face the star.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Predicting the weather conditions K2-141b  Imagine the weather conditions on the planet full of oceans of lava! In this new study, scientists predict the weather conditions on this ‚Äòlava‚Äô planet. And the results show that it‚Äôs nothing less than a ‚Äòhell.‚Äô<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As the #exoplanet is very close to its host star, it takes only six or seven hours to complete one revolution‚Äîmuch faster compared than the closest planet to our Sun i.e., mercury, which takes nearly 87 days to finish one orbit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This ‚Äòhellish‚Äô planet is located about 210 light-years from our habitable #Earth and its host star‚Äîaround which it orbits‚Äîis regarded to be slightly smaller than our Sun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Recently a team of scientists from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research in Kolkata, in collaboration with McGill University, York University, pointed at one such rather scary world named K2-141b.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Among these are the planets that revolve too close to their host star. Most such planets are fiery hot worlds made up of oceans of hot molten lava.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The cosmic universe hosts millions of inhabitable celestial bodies, but some among them are so extreme that their characteristics would scare even Lucifer himself.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>‚ö°Ô∏è ‚Äú#Fossil of 9,000 Years Old Female Hunter Challenge Misguided Assumptions Around #GenderRoles in Early Humans‚Äù   https://t.co/chlvKZYDyy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The misguided belief about historical gender roles often leads to false perceptions around gender-based work, pay or rank that claim that such roles are ‚Äònatural‚Äô and not human-made.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This research highlights our skewed understanding of the gender division of labour in early human societies. Randy Haas says that the findings of this study are perfectly timed in a world that is having serious discussions about gender inequality and labour practices.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This shows a sharp disparity when compared to the recent hunter-gatherer‚Äôs ratio. The scenario is the same in farming and capitalist societies as well, where hunting activity is primarily associated with males and female engagement is well under 30 per cent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The researchers also show that the Wilamaya Patjxa female hunter was the earliest hunter buried in the Americas‚ÄîNorth and South America. Statistical analysis shows that the female ratio in the early hunter populations was between 30 to 50 per cent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to the researchers, this was enough sample to conclude that ‚Äúfemale participation in early big-game hunting was likely nontrivial".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The team found 429 individuals belonging to 107 sites‚Äîout of which 27 individuals could be related to big-game hunting tools. They discovered that out of those 27 individuals 15 were male and 11 were female.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hence they further looked at published records of late Pleistocene and early Holocene burials throughout North and South America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The discovery forced researchers to question if this early female hunter belonged to a broader group of females that were involved in hunting or was a sole cause.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Objects that are with people in their death are the items that would have been the most important to them during their lifetime. When the tools were found, even researchers had zero ideas about what they were going to uncover.  (Image credit: Randy Haas/UC Davis)  https://t.co/52zUZOcXP1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>During one of the archaeological excavations in 2018, researchers found an early burial with a hunting toolkit that had 24 stone tools‚Äîtools for animal processing, projectile points, hefty rocks, tiny flakes with very sharp edges.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the past, a number of studies had excavated hunting tools buried with biological females. In most of these cases, the conclusion, however, was not definitive‚Äîwhile sex was not confirmed in some cases, the burying of stone tools and remains were questioned in others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>However, some scholars have advocated for decades now that the early hunter-gatherer society may not have followed these ‚Äútraditional‚Äù roles‚Äîunlike the hunter-gatherer societies of the 19th century.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Challenging the prehistoric gender roles  So far, many experts believed that when early humans wanted food, men went hunting, and women gathered food through foraging or took care of children.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now, an unexpected new discovery is set to turn this age-old belief on its head! Newly discovered fossil of a 9,000 years old female hunter from a burial site in the Andes Mountains of South America has intrigued researchers and has made them challenge pre-existing belief.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Historical evidence suggests that almost all early humans were hunters and gatherers thousands of years ago before we gradually transformed into agricultural societies.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#DidYouKnow | The ISRO also created a world record of launching largest number of satellites‚Äî104 satellites out of which 101 were foreign in a single PSLV rocket on 15.2.2017. According to the Indian government, ISRO has earned Rs 1,245.17 crore during the last five years...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since then, over the next two decades, India has launched 319 foreign satellites, including one Chinese satellite‚Äîsome on a standalone basis and mostly as a piggyback on India's own satellite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It all started in 1999, when India for the first time launched foreign satellites‚ÄîSouth Korea's Kitsat-3 weighing 107 kg and Germany's 45 kg DLR-Tubsat‚Äîas piggyback luggage on the country's own 1,050 kg Oceansat with the #PSLVC2 rocket.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If all goes well with the Saturday evening rocketing of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (#PSLVC49) then the Indian space agency would have slung a total of 328 foreign satellites.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The satellite can take pictures day and night and will be useful for surveillance, as well as civilian activities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The rocket's primary payload is India's radar imaging satellite EOS-01, formerly RISAT-2BR2 with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) that can shoot pictures in all weather conditions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The nine foreign satellites are from: Lithuania (1-technology demonstrator), Luxembourg (4 maritime application satellites by Kleos Space) and the US (4-Lemur multi-mission remote sensing satellites).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The rocket with 10 satellites is expected to lift off at 3.02 p.m. on November 7 from the #Sriharikota rocket port, a senior official of the Indian Space Research Organisation (@isro) said.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Overall, October 2020 marked the second successive month with the above-average monthly extent in the Antarctic, after 48 consecutive months of below-average extents.  #ClimateChange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The largest positive anomalies of this lot were observed east of the Antarctic Peninsula and north and westward of the Ross Sea.  #ClimateChange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In October 2020, Antarctic sea ice extent reached 18.3 million km2 on average, which is not only 0.3 million km2 (or about 1.4%) above the 1981-2010 average for October, but also the first positive October anomaly observed since 2016!   #ClimateChange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the flip side, the #Antarctic saw sea ice reach its annual maximum extent in September, with the sea ice melting season at the southern pole beginning in #October.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>October also marked the fourth consecutive month with ice-free or close to ice-free conditions along the Northern Sea Route, with only the central Arctic Ocean and parts of the Canadian archipelago showing average ice concentrations.  (üì∏: Copernicus Climate Change/ECMWF)  https://t.co/JUaUoZ0yFc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Low ice concentration in this region could end up having prolonged effects on Arctic sea ice cover during the upcoming winter and summer, as the Laptev Sea is known to be an important regional source for sea ice.  #ClimateChange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As for the ice concentrations, the largest negative ice concentration anomalies relative to the 1981-2010 average occurred north of the Laptev and East Siberian Seas, owing to the very large positive temperature anomalies.   #ClimateChange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Deteriorating sea-ice cover  October marks the beginning of the sea ice growth season in the Arctic. Last month, the monthly average Arctic sea ice extent amounted to 5.4 million km2, rising from the 1.5 million km2 from September 2020.  (üì∏: Copernicus Climate Change/ECMWF)  https://t.co/o6nXDcJiRZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TRIVIA: October 2020 was the warmest October ever recorded in Europe!   The European-average temperature for the month was 1.6¬∞C above the 1981-2010 average; and 0.1¬∞C and 0.2¬∞C above October 2001 and October 2006‚Äîthe next two warmest Octobers over Europe‚Äîrespectively.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even in India, October 2020 remained the third-warmest October on record, with an average maximum temperature of 32¬∞C. As per the India Meteorological Department (IMD) records, October 2020 witnessed the warmest nights as compared to the past 50 years.  #ClimateChange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While last month was marginally warmer than some of the hottest Octobers on record, including Octobers of 2016, 2017, and 2018, it just fell short of Octobers of 2015 and 2019 by less than 0.1¬∞C.  #ClimateChange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Above-average temperatures around the globe  The global-mean temperatures through October 2020 were 0.62¬∞C warmer than the 1981-2010 average for October.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As per the latest report by the European Union's Earth Observation Programme named Copernicus, October 2020 is well in line with the recent trends, as the third-warmest October ever recorded on planet Earth.  #ClimateChange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While the #COVID19Pandemic and the associated nationwide lockdowns did appear to have handed nature a much-needed ‚Äòbreak‚Äô, the long-term build-up of warming agents in our atmosphere has continued to push mercury levels up across the globe.  #ClimateChange<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It also hosts our neighbouring galaxy, the Andromeda. The closest large clusters encountered by us is about fifty million light-years away, based in the Virgo constellation and consist of 2000 member galaxies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most of the galaxies in the universe are part of some cluster, including our Milky Way‚Äî which is a member of the ‚ÄòLocal Group‚Äô comprising about 54 galaxies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Strong magnetic field  Moreover, the other factor, which played an important role, was the strong magnetic field originating from these clusters, while the magnetic field of the nearby galaxy clusters was not very strong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When large clusters merge, the electrons are accelerated to the speed of light due to the turbulent motion. Further, the accelerated electrons release radio waves, which come in close contact with the magnetic field in the clusters, thus giving out a bright light.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Studying the cluster-collision  For the study, the team of researchers looked for the collision by observing a set of galaxy clusters. The researchers were able to observe collision, as this process accelerates particles‚Äîlike electrons‚Äîto high speeds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moreover, the collision is noted as the most distant ever to be captured by astronomers and is the first time that collisions of such distant clusters have been studied.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The study led by researchers from Leiden University in the Netherlands estimates that the cataclysmic collision took place about seven billion years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These mammoth cosmic structures can sometimes collide with each other over a course of millions of years. Now, for the first time, astronomers have mapped nine massive collisions between galaxy clusters from the early universe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These clusters can consist of thousands of galaxies, with billions of stars loosely bound by gravity and are considered to be the largest structures in the universe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The ever-expanding universe contains thousands of galaxies spread across space and time continuum. Interestingly, some of these galaxies are closely packed together, which form a galaxy cluster.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>‚ö°Ô∏è ‚Äú20 Years of ISS: Technologies Administered for Life on Space Station Helped People on Earth‚Äù  @Space_Station @NASA   https://t.co/ONTPl6Txtm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Mice injected with an antibody to inhibit production of the protein sclerostin spent two weeks on the space station. Upon their return, the mice were found to have increased bone formation and improved bone structure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SpaceStation testing is also helpful in other aspects of human health. For example, in 2011, biotechnology company Amgen teamed up with @NASA to study a treatment for osteoporosis which causes bones to become weak and brittle.  @Space_Station<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The company's "Awake and Alert" and "Goodnight" bulbs use the same principles as the station's lights to help people work through the day and then prepare for bed.  @Space_Station<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After these LEDs proved useful on the station, Florida-based Lighting Science was interested in bringing these innovations to the market.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By installing LEDs that can vary the amount of blue light astronauts receive, a 24-hour day can be simulated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Astronauts aboard the space station need special light of their own to maintain a regular sleep schedule. Orbiting Earth every 90 minutes, the space station experiences 16 sunrises and sunsets every day, so its occupants' circadian rhythms get thrown off.   @Space_Station<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The plant habitat was designed in part by a company called #OSRAM, whose Phytofy RL system uses a similar network of lights for plant research on Earth and is now commercially available for researchers.  @Space_Station<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For example, plants on Earth take various cues from sunlight.  On the space station, the Advanced Plant Habitat uses an array of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to simulate sunlight and optimise plant growth.  @Space_Station<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lack of gravity is not the only difference that takes getting used to in space: the lack of a normal day-and-night cycle inside the space station disrupts important biorhythms. NASA has performed extensive research into how different wavelengths of light affect humans and plants.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Research into miniaturising this technology eventually resulted in a specialised scale that can help train people to improve their balance and predict when falls are likely, @NASA said.  @Space_Station<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After they return to #Earth, #NASA tests astronauts' sense of balance using a phonebooth-sized system. Making these measurements on the #Moon or #Mars requires something more portable.  @Space_Station<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Down on Earth, the same technology also powers exercise machines like the Bowflex Revolution and the OYO fitness portable gym. But the effects of weightlessness do not disappear as soon as astronauts are back on solid ground.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The springs soon became the basis of an exercise machine that was used on the space station for over a decade.  @Space_Station<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Inventor Paul Francis worked with NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston to perfect Spiraflex, springs that simulate the tension of lifting a weight without needing a physically heavy object.   @Space_Station<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For example, @NASA research has shown that exercise is the best way to reduce harm caused by extended stays in microgravity. But this is not so easy, since barbells do not do much good without gravity.  @Space_Station<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Technologies developed for and aboard the International Space Station have benefited people on the ground, from improving workouts to helping us get a good night's sleep, #NASA said as the orbiting laboratory marked 20 years of continuous habitation on Monday.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Located in the "Pacific Ring of Fire," the Philippines is among the most disaster-prone countries in the world, including active volcanoes, frequent earthquakes, and an average of 20 typhoons a year causing #floods and #landslides.  #TyphoonGoni #Philippines<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Typhoons and tropical storms regularly hit the Philippines from June through December, claiming hundreds of lives and causing billions of dollars in damages.  #TyphoonGoni #Philippines<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meanwhile, the state weather bureau said it is also tracking Tropical Depression Atsani, churning in the Pacific Ocean 1,365 km east of central Luzon.   #TyphoonGoni #Philippines<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Goni, the 18th cyclone to hit the Philippines this year, struck close to the regions hit by typhoon Molave last week, which killed 22 people and destroyed infrastructure and crops.  #TyphoonGoni #Philippines<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is forecast to weaken further into a severe tropical storm as it is heading towards the #SouthChinaSea.   #TyphoonGoni #Philippines<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It triggered flash floods and mudslides in the Bicol region, and left a trail of destruction in 12 out of the 17 regions in the Philippines. It was downgraded a few hours later as it swept westward across Luzon at the speed of 25 km per hour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Goni was a "super typhoon" made its first landfall packing maximum sustained winds of 225 km per hour near the centre and gustiness of up to 310 km per hour.  #TyphoonGoni #Philippines<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to the OCD, Goni has displaced over 390,000 people. More than 345,000 of the displaced were staying in the government evacuation centres, it added.  #TyphoonGoni #Philippines<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Due to its rare appearance, the turtle has left netizens surprised. The photos of the turtle have been widely shared on the microblogging sites. Here are some reactions from the Twitteratis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IFS Susanta Nanda (@susantananda3) posted the initial footage of the first yellow turtle spotted in Odisha back in July, and soon the images went viral on social media sites.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The turtles are omnivores and usually devour frogs, snails and aquatic vegetation. In 2016, a green albino turtle was spotted on an Australian beach.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These turtle species, Indian flapshell turtle or Lissemys punctata, can be commonly found in South Asian countries like Pakistan, Sri Lanka, India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Myanmar. The species of turtle have softshell and mostly live in freshwater ecosystems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In her post, Wildlife Biologist Sneha Dharwadkar commented that the rescued turtle is the yellow morph of albino Indian flapshell turtle. Moreover, it's not just that specific parts of the turtle are yellow but the whole shell and body of the appear to be of the same colour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Experts say that the absence of colouring pigment is probably due to genetic mutation or congenital disorder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The rare colour of the turtle is attributed to the deficiency of pigment called tyrosine, which is present in high amounts in reptiles including crocodiles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After the rescue, the pictures of the rare yellow turtle were posted on Twitter by Indian Forest Service officer Debashish Sharma on Tuesday. The turtle has once again become an online sensation, with nearly two thousand likes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the second such incident, while the first yellow one was spotted in Balasore district, Odisha back in July 2020.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nature is full of wonders, and we are yet to discover many of them. Recently, residents spotted a rare yellow turtle from Burdwan village pond in West Bengal, this Tuesday, October 27.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The study states that these giant birds were part of the Antarctic ecosystem for over 10 million years.   The last known pelagornithid fossil belongs to the time of 2.5 million years ago, this was the time when the Earth‚Äôs climate changed and led to the beginning of the ice age.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The study highlights that nearly fifty million years ago, Antarctica had a completely different climate than today.  During the time the continent was not covered with ice, and therefore hosted an ideal condition for these birds to thrive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The second fossil recovered from Antarctica‚Äîpart of the jaw bone‚Äîbelongs to the time of 40 million years ago.   The study paints a completely different picture of the white continent as it was not just dominated by penguins but many other animals millions of years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pelagornithids species of bird dominated the world just after the mass extinction 65 million years ago &amp; continued to live until about 2.5 million years ago.  The recent study describes various small fossils of the pelagornithid family dating back to nearly 62 million years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In fact, that era has inspired many science fiction movies, as well.   The well-preserved fossil remains from the museum are identified as a partial jaw bone and foot bone of two huge ancient birds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These ancient giant birds once flew over the southern ocean‚Äîencircling Antarctica‚Äîfor at least 60 million years.  Many studies have highlighted how large birds dominated various landscapes of the Earth millions of years ago and eventually became extinct.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It had been the common understanding that these black holes are formed by the chance coalescence of slightly smaller black holes over the life of the universe.  #BlackHoles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another outstanding problem in black hole physics has to do with the largest heaviest black holes, exceeding several billion times the mass of our Sun.  #BlackHoles  (üì∏: NASA/Caltech/R. Hurt (IPAC))  https://t.co/vvMjAzXQ2y<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The size of this spherical boundary can be predicted from the simple idea of escape velocity and setting it equal to the speed of light, and it is also predicted by the theory of General Relativity. However, what happens inside this event horizon is completely unknown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚ÄòUnknown mysteries‚Äô around #blackholes?   Black holes are defined by a spherical surface known as the event horizon.   (üì∏: NASA/UMass/D.Wang et al., IR: NASA/STScI)  https://t.co/HfHM4yiWbY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The same mechanism that makes them powerful beacons in the sky also appears to bring these giant black holes into centre-stage in the story of how their host galaxies themselves evolve.  #BlackHoles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The giant black holes in the hearts of galaxies appear to influence not just their very close neighbourhood‚Äîby their strong gravity‚Äîbut also the formation of stars in the galaxies that host them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What do we know about them so far?  The smallest black holes we know are a few times heavier than our Sun and are scattered throughout the Milky Way‚Äîand in other galaxies as well.   #BlackHoles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>However, the discovery of enormous black holes very early on starts to contradict this idea because there is not enough time from the beginning of the universe for these enormous giant #BlackHoles to form by coalescence of tiny ones.   (Image credit: NASA/CXC/M.Weiss)  https://t.co/OHe7GiZ6sM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The giant #blackholes in the centres of galaxies may have formed by the coalescence (merging of two black holes to form one) of stellar-mass black holes that formed early in the life of the universe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Over sixty-five such black holes are known (and counting), and it is estimated that there are about 10 million of them in a galaxy like our #MilkyWay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, how are the black holes formed?  When the heaviest stars exhaust their fuel and can no longer shine, they collapse because of their own gravity and form these black holes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Similarly, our Sun, which is of much larger mass than the Earth, if squeezed to a diameter of about 6 km, would become a black hole.  #AskAnAstronomer #BlackHoles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If all of the Earth is squeezed into the size of a marble, the escape velocity would just exceed the speed of light, which would mean that even light cannot escape from it. Such an object would be a black hole.   #AskAnAstronomer #BlackHoles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If one imagines that the earth is squeezed to a smaller and smaller size, then the escape velocity at its surface would increase with decreasing size.   #AskAnAstronomer (Image credit: IANS)  https://t.co/tXx0R61wEB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The escape velocity depends on the weight and size of the host object. For Earth, a speed of 11 kilometres per second is needed to escape from it.  #AskAnAstronomer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is the minimum speed at which we need to launch something‚Äîsay a ball‚Äîfor it to escape away from the object, rather than fall back on it.   #AskAnAstronomer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What are #blackholes?  Black holes are chunks of space, or more precisely, space-time from which even light cannot escape. An intuitive grasp of black holes can be got if we think of the idea of the escape velocity from an object.   (üì∏: NASA/JPL-Caltech)  https://t.co/LRSm2oezZl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BlackHoles are enigmatic monsters of the cosmic world. Scientists have been continuously seeking to understand these completely dark worlds, whose gravitational pull is so strong that nothing can escape, not even light.   #AskAnAstronomer<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Dr M.V. Padma Srivastava, head of neurosciences centre at AIIMS said in a summit today that a massive awareness among the public to recognise the signals of stroke and quality training of physicians is needed at large to ensure medical care reaches the patients timely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The experts also observed that general practitioners and people at large need to be educated to recognise stroke signals since immediate medical care is the only intervention that can save lives of such patients.   #AirPollution #Pollution #PollutionWatch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Low awareness of preventive measures, lack of uniform treatment, and lack of access to the treatment are a few key reasons of high incidence of stroke and mortality in these regions.  #AirPollution #Pollution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>South-East Asian countries including India and China, are responsible for 70% of the total stroke burden in the world and 80-85% stroke deaths occur in these countries.  #AirPollution #Pollution #PollutionWatch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In India, it is among the top five causes of disease burden and has risen from the 12th position in 1990.  #AirPollution #Pollution #PollutionWatch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stroke has remained as the second-most common cause of death across the world. Several studies and data by the World Health Organisation (WHO) suggest that every 2 seconds, a case of stroke is reported and every 6th second, a person dies from it, across the globe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dr Samir K. Kalra, neurosurgeon at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, observed that the blood is getting thicker, arteries losing flexibility and average blood pressure rising with the increase in the air pollution levels.  #AirPollution #Pollution #PollutionWatch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Prof (Dr) Manjari Tripathi, head of neurology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) said that strokes incidents are bound to increase with a spike in pollution.  #AirPollution #Pollution #PollutionWatch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dr Vinit Suri, senior consultant, neurology at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital and immediate past president of Indian Stroke Association, said that air pollution is also being considered as one of the key factors for stroke and cardiovascular diseases (among other co-morbidities).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meanwhile, experts have also observed that exposure to the polluted air for a prolonged period could advance the risk of developing strokes.   #AirPollution #Pollution #PollutionWatch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Evidences, supported by epidemiological studies and researches, have emerged which show rise in pollution is synonymous to the increase in incidents of strokes.  #AirPollution #Pollution #PollutionWatch<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Improving our understanding of these complex fin whale songs could provide new insights into how their populations move and change over time, and this knowledge, in return, could help our efforts to better protect and manage this endangered species.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Prior to this finding, researchers simply considered new whale songs in a region as signals of a new individual or group‚Äôs arrival from a different part of the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This led the researchers to conclude that the local whales picked these new song patterns while on their migratory travels, in a unique process of cultural transmission between groups from different regions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Overall, five main song patterns were recorded through the course of the study. Interestingly, while some song patterns were unique to this area, others were similar to the ones recorded years ago, within populations off the north-west coast of the US.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And when different song patterns were received from the same location, they were able to determine that the sounds were likely created by just one individual creature.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The sound waves picked up by the hydrophones allowed researchers to triangulate the source and determine the position of the whales.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To study their song patterns, a team of researchers used multiple hydrophones (underwater microphones), to record the songs and locations of 115 whale encounters near Kauai, Hawaii over a period of six years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New findings indicate that these intelligent deep-sea creatures are capable of singing multiple songs, and their groups swap songs with each other in what appears to be a sign of cultural transmission between whale groups from different regions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Until now, it was believed that male fin whales‚Äîthe second largest mammals on the planet‚Äîwere only capable of singing one song pattern, with each song being unique to males in one particular group. But now, a new study has blown this theory out of the water!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>With such relentless warming, the question of methane release into the atmosphere was a matter of when rather than if and the time appears to have dawned upon the region now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TRIVIA | Siberia in 2020 saw temperatures that were 5¬∞C higher than average from January to June. Last winter‚Äôs sea ice melting started unusually early, while this winter‚Äôs freeze hasn't begun yet‚Äîalready a later than normal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheArctic is getting warmed nearly three times faster than the global average. In the last two years, the temperatures in the region have repeatedly breached the all-time high recorded levels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This let out #methane is reaching the sea surface at amounts of tens to hundreds of times higher than normal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The discovery points at a potential third source of methane emissions from the region. Previously, Igor Semiletov, the chief scientist on board had reported that the gas was being discharged from the shelf of the Arctic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scientists suspect that the destabilisation might have occurred due to intrusion by warm Atlantic currents into the eastern Arctic and this climate disruption‚Äî‚ÄúAtlantification‚Äù‚Äî has probably occurred due to human activities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The scientists observed clouds of bubbles getting released from the deposit at six monitoring points spread over a sloped area which is 150 km in length and 10 km wide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First observations of methane discharge  The observations are said to be the first of the predicted methane release over the arctic. The scientists have confirmed that the release has already begun across a huge area of the slope which is 600 km offshore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Though the released methane bubbles were getting dissolved in water, the surface methane levels were four to eight times higher than the normally expected level, as per the scientists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Such discoveries have led to growing concerns among scientists about accelerated global warming since a new climate feedback loop might have been triggered already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the Laptev Sea slope, scientists have discovered #methane concentrations of up to 1,600 nanomoles per litre at a depth of 300 metres. This is 400 times more than the predicted concentration when the sea and the atmosphere is at equilibrium.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to the United States Geological Survey, if Arctic hydrate gets destabilised, then there is a huge risk as it is one of the four most dangerous scenarios that can cause abrupt climate change in future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Greenhouse gas deposits‚Äîa growing concern The Arctic has large amounts of frozen methane and other gases‚Äîcalled hydrates‚Äîin its slope sediments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is called a positive feedback loop that reinforces global warming further.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The methane trapped in the permanently frozen region of the arctic region is an accumulation of hundreds of thousands of years of biomass hidden from the atmosphere. As warming continues, the glacier melts, releasing large amounts of methane and causing further warming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Methane is an extremely potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential of 80, meaning a molecule of methane can lead to 80 times more warming than a carbon dioxide molecule.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Research suggests that deposits have begun leaking methane over a large area of around 1,500 sq. km., area of the continental slope off the East Siberian coast, reports The Guardian.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chunks of #FrozenMethane deposits in the Arctic Ocean, famously known as the ‚Äúsleeping giants of the carbon cycle‚Äù, appear to have woken up now following unprecedented heatwave and ice melting around the north pole.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Even in animals, there exists a simple mechanism for reducing transmission, wherein the infected animals show sickness behaviour through increased lethargy and sleep, which effectively reduces their movement and sociality, and helps them practise a form of social isolation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This phenomenon is observed in some social insects as well, wherein sick insects either self-isolate, or are kept out by their colony mates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even during the treatment period, bats that were ‚Äúill‚Äù spent 25 minutes lesser connecting per partner when compared to control bats. After the treatment period was over, these differences diminished when the bats slept or foraged outside the roost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The changes in behaviour and meetings were recorded for 16 ‚Äúill‚Äù bats and 15 healthy bats under natural conditions.  On average, the probability of a control bat associating with another control bat was 49%, while the same associating with an ‚Äúill‚Äù bat was only 35%.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After this, proximity sensors were glued to these bats for the next three days, and they were then released back into their hollow tree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sickness was stimulated in a random chunk of the bats by injecting them with lipopolysaccharide, an immune-challenging substance. The rest of the bats, which belonged to the control group, were given saline injections.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the study, researchers captured 31 adult female vampire bats from a roost inside a hollow tree at Lamanai, Belize. With the aim of understanding the impact of sickness behaviour on relationships over time, they created a social network from high-resolution proximity data.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This kind of behaviour was previously observed in laboratory settings, but scientists have now conducted a field experiment in the forests to confirm the same in natural settings as well.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>...the fact remains that vaccines have been the most effective weapons that have saved millions of lives against several deadly diseases.  #Vaccination #Immunization #Vaccine #ScienceSherlock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And while some people remain firm against vaccination due to their traditional beliefs, mistrust in pharmaceutical companies, misconceptions about vaccines, or just the fear of being injected with a weakened or dead virus...  #Vaccination #Immunization #Vaccine #ScienceSherlock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The combination of viruses and other ingredients form a vaccine, which is then tested vigorously across multiple phases and trials. Only after being deemed safe and effective is the vaccine approved for mass production and public use.  #Vaccination #Immunization #ScienceSherlock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This strategy is utilised when an immune response to one part of the virus (or bacteria) is sufficient to ensure full protection against the disease. #Vaccines for hepatitis B and human papillomavirus (HPV) belong to this category.  #Vaccination #Immunization #ScienceSherlock<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>These vaccines are especially beneficial for individuals with weak immune systems, as the dead viruses are incapable of causing even mild forms of the disease they are meant to prevent.   #Vaccination #Immunization #Vaccine #ScienceSherlock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2. Inactivated viruses: Some vaccines consist of viruses that are inactivated or, at times, completely killed. However, the human body still spots these ‚Äúdead‚Äù viruses and begins generating immune system cells that protect against the viral disease.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chickenpox and oral polio are some of the common examples of vaccines with weakened viruses, along with the Oxford University‚Äôs COVID-19 vaccine candidate AZD1222, which uses the weakened version of a common cold virus, or adenovirus, that causes infections in chimpanzees.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Due to the lack of replication, such viruses fail to cause the disease, but nevertheless, induce memory B cells that protect your body against future infections.   #Vaccination #Immunization #Vaccine #ScienceSherlock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Vaccines are typically made using three types of viruses:  1. Weakened viruses: While natural and healthy viruses reproduce thousands of times during an infection, the weakened viruses in vaccines are too weak to multiply optimally, and usually reproduce no more than 20 times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In doing so, the modern vaccines ensure that the body does not experience any serious effects of the disease during vaccination, by altering the pathogens and by carrying out rigorous testing.  #Vaccination #Immunization #Vaccine #ScienceSherlock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Therefore, while most medicines treat or cure diseases, #vaccines train the body to fight back infection by awakening its defence system, aka immunity.   #Vaccination #Immunization #Vaccine #ScienceSherlock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is done to ensure that if the individual later ends up encountering a potent version of the same #virus, his/her body is already equipped with the antibodies and immune response required to deal with the viral attack, with minimal damage to the body.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But as far as modern-day vaccines are concerned, the foundation for vaccinology was officially laid by an English physician and scientist named Edward Jenner who, in 1796, inoculated a 13-year-old boy with vaccinia virus (cowpox) and effectively demonstrated immunity to smallpox.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üíâThe essence of the idea dates back to stories from hundreds of years ago, wherein Buddhist monks drank snake venom to immunise themselves from lethal snake bites well in advance.   #ScienceSherlock<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Orbital and impactor missions over the past 20 years, such as NASA‚Äôs Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite, confirmed ice in permanently shadowed craters around the Moon‚Äôs poles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SOFIA‚Äôs results build on years of previous research examining the presence of water on the Moon. When the Apollo astronauts first returned from the Moon in 1969, it was thought to be completely dry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Under #NASA‚Äôs Artemis program, the agency is eager to learn all it can about the presence of water on the Moon in advance of sending the first woman and next man to the lunar surface in 2024 and establishing a sustainable human presence there by the end of the decade.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a comparison, the Sahara desert has 100 times the amount of water than what SOFIA detected in the lunar soil. Despite the small amounts, the discovery raises new questions about how water is created and how it persists on the harsh, airless lunar surface.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Data from this location reveal water in concentrations of 100 to 412 parts per million ‚Äì roughly equivalent to a 12-ounce bottle of water ‚Äì trapped in a cubic meter of soil spread across the lunar surface. The results are published in the latest issue of Nature Astronomy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The study was conducted by examining the deposits of river sands and gravels exposed by quarrying activity near Nal village, outside Bikaner in 2014 and 2019. Through this, the team was able to understand and find evidence on different phases of the river activity.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>‚ö°Ô∏è ‚Äú2020 #OzoneHole Among Deepest and Largest! Why Are Scientists Not Worried?‚Äù by @weatherindia   #OzoneDepletion #OzoneLayer  https://t.co/RRGfLTFUaX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Despite small spikes in usage once in a while, damage to  #ozone due to human-made chemicals have largely been contained since the 2000s. The current variability, by and large, appears to be natural and a quick recovery is expected as the season changes.  #OzoneLayer #OzoneHole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>However, after the successful implementation of the Montreal Protocol, the use of such Ozone Depleting Substances has been brought under control.  #OzoneLayer #OzoneHole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A significant widening of the ozone hole was observed by studies way back between the 1970s and 1980s, and the primary cause of this drastic depletion was identified as the significant increase in the use of damaging chlorofluorocarbons in products like refrigerators.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If this wind band is relatively strong, then the exchange of air masses between polar and latitudes can be restricted. Therefore, this keeps the polar latitudes isolated, indicating a strong polar vortex.  #OzoneLayer #OzoneHole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As per the ESA, the variability of the ozone hole size is largely determined through the strength of a strong wind band around Antarctica. The strong wind band occurs due to Earth‚Äôs rotation and temperature difference between polar and moderate latitudes.   #OzoneLayer #OzoneHole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The 2019‚Äôs ozone hole, on the other hand, was recorded to be the smallest in the last 30 years. Last year, the hole reached its peak at 16. 4 million square kilometres on September 8, 2019, and then shrank to 10 million square kilometres for the rest of September and October 2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Variability of the ozone hole  The measurements of the present hole were obtained from the ESA‚Äôs Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite, which revealed the size to be around 24 million sq km on October 2.   #OzoneLayer #OzoneHole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The clouds contain ice crystals that can destroy the ozone when mixed with sunlight. This kick starts a chemical reaction, which turns non-reactive compounds in ozone into reactive ones.  #OzoneLayer #OzoneHole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As per the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), the polar stratospheric clouds formed over ozone can easily contribute to the chemical destruction of ozone when the temperature drops to -78¬∞C.   #OzoneLayer #OzoneHole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The polar vortex is a weather system responsible for delivering cold air to the Polar Regions and this year scientists have recorded it to be one of the strongest.  (Image credit: Robert Schwarz/University of Minnesota/NASA)  https://t.co/h6pvNjoGss<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Depletion of #ozone  The ozone hole‚Äînot a typical hole, but a drop in thickness‚Äîis predominantly present at the southern hemisphere of the globe.

<|startoftext|>Thereafter, Hera will be launched in 2024, and it will reach Didymos in 2027 with the objective of measuring the impact crater caused by DART and learning about the change in the asteroid‚Äôs orbital path.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DART will be launched in 2021, with the aim of hitting the small asteroid of Didymos with a speed of 6 km per second in 2022.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These missions focus on Didymos, a binary asteroid system comprising two asteroids which circle a common barycentre. This system is located fairly close to Earth, with its rocks‚Äô size arming them with the potential to cause significant destruction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Among the defensive measures is the Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment (AIDA), which includes the European Space Agency‚Äôs (ESA) Hera and Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meanwhile, scientists have come up with many ways to deal with the dangers posed by enormous asteroids, like blasting the asteroids before they reach Earth, or hitting them with a spacecraft to change their path.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But in the case of 2018VP1, its diameter is just around 2 metres, and its size is that of a small automobile. Therefore, it will simply burn up into a fireball once it enters our planet‚Äôs atmosphere‚Äîa phenomenon that occurs quite frequently every year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As per The Planetary Society, there are around 1 billion asteroids whose diameters are over 1 metre. Further, the asteroids that can cause harm to us are the ones whose diameters are at least 30 metres.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thankfully, at least for the next 100 years, there are no chances of any such massive rocks coming in contact with our planet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to NASA‚Äôs Near-Earth Object Observations Programme, asteroids that are 140 metres or over are the ones that can cause significant damage, and hence, are of greatest concern.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moreover, its chances of breaking into the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere are a mere 0.41%, or one in 240. And even if it does manage to break through, it would simply get dismantled due to its small size.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even in August this year, NASA had specified that this asteroid offers no risk to our planet. Due to its tiny size, which amounts to approximately 6.5 feet, it is of minimal threat to our existence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tyson said that this rock is not big enough to cause any harm, and if the world ends in 2020, the universe will not be the one to blame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our world has already witnessed many unprecedented disasters and events this year. But luckily, the approaching asteroid will not be a threat to our planet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But now, NASA‚Äôs close approach database has indicated that it could reach approximately 4,700 miles close to our planet this year.  On Sunday, October 18, Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson took Twitter by shock with his tweet, which informed about the asteroid‚Äôs approach.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The asteroid, named 2018VP, was discovered two years ago by the Palomar Observatory in California. It was observed for 13 days, but it escaped from detection after that. During the time of its discovery, the space rock was 2,80,000 miles away from the Earth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An asteroid is all set to add to the drama of the US Elections! Mimicking the shape and size of a refrigerator, it is on its way to ‚Äúbuzz-cut‚Äù the Earth just a day before the US presidential elections take place on November 3.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And this very fact should serve as a glaring warning message to present-day humans: if we do not take sufficient measures to curb climate change, we could end up with the same fate as our predecessors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our ancestors, who were no less impressive in terms of mental power as compared to any other species on Earth, simply could not survive climate change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Overall, their goal was to understand the climate preferences of all these early human species, and how each of them adapted or reacted to changes in climate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In this study, researchers combined climate models and fossil records to determine if there was any link between the early extinctions and the climate scenario at the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As for the species that went extinct, their inability to adapt to changing climate‚Äîeither warming or cooling temperatures‚Äîappears to have played a major role in sealing their fate, a new research has found.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of the six or more different species of early humans, all belonging to the genus Homo, us #HomoSapiens are the only ones that have managed to survive until the present day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But now, a thunderous warning has arrived through a new research study, which indicates that #ClimateChange may have driven the extinction of at least three early human species.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In spite of this fact, a majority of the human race doesn‚Äôt seem to have fully grasped the possibility that unmitigated climate change could wipe our entire species off the face of the Earth as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...the influence of climate change on these occurrences‚Äîmajor in some cases, minor in others‚Äîis clear for all to see.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This coral reef system comprises more than 2,900 individual reefs, and is home to more than 1,500 species of fish and about 411 species of hard corals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Coral ecosystems can be found across the world, with the largest of all being The Great Barrier Reef in Australia, which extends upto 2,400 kms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Such a rapid decline in the coral ecosystem can have an adverse impact on the other aquatic population thriving in its abode‚Äîmainly the fish species. As per NOAA, nearly 25% of the ocean‚Äôs fish depend on coral reefs, and therefore, their health is really important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moreover, the reduction in larger corals can be the greatest threat, as they hold the capability to store more eggs and thus influence the ecosystem‚Äôs growth.  https://t.co/StgoRGVlQ1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the species to have suffered the most significant decline is the staghorn corals, which appear as branching corals. The decline suggests that this may significantly reduce the recovery potential of coral populations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...and the colourful algae living in their tissues. When corals are overburdened or stressed by the change in surrounding conditions‚Äîlike increasing temperatures, ocean acidification‚Äîthey break this symbiotic relationship with algae, thus causing them to turn white, or ‚Äòbleach‚Äô.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The study noted that water temperatures were significantly higher in the years 2016 and 2017, which witnessed a strong El Ni√±o over the Pacific Ocean.   The bright, beautiful colours of the coral reefs are a result of the symbiotic relationship between the corals...  https://t.co/yHhAsIXLDF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...size between 1995 and 2017 at a stretch of 2300 km, and then compared this data with the historical baselines (1995/1996).  As per the study, one of the main factors behind the decline was found to be mass bleaching, which usually happens due to warm and acidifying waters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The coral system is among the most popular and rich ecosystem of the world, and its unprecedented decline is linked to the rising water temperatures.   For the study, researchers from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies examined coral colonies and their...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The study highlights that the population of all sizes of corals‚Äîbe it small, medium or large corals‚Äîhas fallen by around 50%.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>‚ö°Ô∏è ‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs CO2 Emissions Dropped by 15.4% in First Half of 2020; Study Shows 8.8% Drop Globally. The bigger question - is it time to rejoice just yet?‚Äù - by @deekshith_np   #emissions #carbonemissions #CO2Emission   https://t.co/cOksJCYXyI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The study methodology can help shed light on long-term impacts of the changes we see now, from more people working from home to commuters avoiding mass transit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Researchers of the study hope that the method they have developed to track the national and global carbon emissions will help to assess the impact of subtle and persistent changes in the carbon stock as per our response.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reopening economies remain the highest priority for the government, however, experts urge that reopening sustainably could help us build back better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the other hand, the largest emitter in the world, #China, witnessed a relatively small decrease in the CO2 emissions by 187.2 Mt, which amounted to a mere 3.7% drop compared to 2019.  #CarbonEmissions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The US witnessed a drop of 338.3 Mt (13.3% less than 2019) of CO2, followed by the European Union (EU27) and the UK at 205.7 Mt (12.7% less than 2019).   #CarbonEmissions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No reason to celebrate  In terms of absolute volume, the study observed the most pronounced decline in carbon emissions from the United States in the first half of 2020.   #CarbonEmissions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In February 2020, in fact, India had witnessed an increase in CO2 emissions by 6.4% compared to 2019. Globally, international aviation witnessed the sharpest fall in emissions by 52.4%, says the study.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In India, the greatest decrease in CO2 emissions was recorded in April (44.2%), followed by May (27.6%), March (16.9%) and June (15%).   #CarbonEmissions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the sharpest fall of year-on-year emissions among all the major economies in the world‚Äîin line with the drastic fall of 23.9% in Gross Domestic Products witnessed in the first quarter of FY 2020-21.  #CarbonEmissions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Consequently, as per the study, India has witnessed a whopping 15.4% drop in carbon emissions in the first six months of 2020‚Äîequivalent to 205.2 Mt lesser emissions compared to the same period in 2019.   #CarbonEmissions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>India went through one of the most restrictive lockdowns during the early days spread from March to May.  #CarbonEmissions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sharp drop in India  While changes in meteorological conditions and holiday seasons were also associated with a sharp decrease in CO2 emissions, the major differentiator this year was the lockdowns enforced across most of the countries to limit the spread of #coronavirus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This accounts for a sharp drop of 8.8%‚Äîmore than the drop witnessed during the economic recessions or World War II.  #CarbonEmissions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A new study from the researchers from China and France show that the global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have dropped by more than 1,500 Million Tonnes (Mt) cumulatively in the first half of 2020 compared to the same period last year.   #CarbonEmissions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #COVID19Pandemic has caused unimaginable human suffering and economic collapse. Yet, on the environment-front, the pandemic-induced lockdowns have taught us how we can contribute to a cleaner tomorrow through responsible, planned and controlled human activities.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#NoisePollution must be considered as a potential cause of death of whales, dolphins and porpoises and must be addressed, say experts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Noise pollution from oil and gas explorations, ships, and seismic surveys also shifts the migration route of certain whales and often lead to mass stranding events. Recent observations show that whales entangled in nets have damaged ears.   (Image Credit: Wendy Cover/NOAA)  https://t.co/rKyu2OM9K5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NoisePollution by ships and boats severely affects whales and several cretaceous species since they rely heavily on sound signals for navigation, communication, finding food, and mating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to Save the Whales organisation, whales and dolphins in the Western North Atlantic have been surfacing through the oil-slicked areas in the ocean, which makes them either lose their way or even die.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ChemicalPollution and oil slicks are other factors which threaten these species and need immediate attention.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Experts believe that the conservation of whales, dolphins and porpoises are 'key for our survival as well as theirs'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The scientists have stressed the importance of protecting the marine species for future generations and have mentioned how these species are crucial for the health of global water bodies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gill nets and fish traps kill thousands of these marine mammals annually. Whaling still continues today in Iceland, Norway, Japan, and the Faroe Islands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Along with this, 24 species of cetaceans have been stated as ‚Äòdata deficient‚Äô by the IUCN, meaning not much is known about these species‚Äô population.  #Whales #Dolphins #MarineSpecies (Image credit: @NOAA)  https://t.co/bccz6ACDNX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of these, 13 species have been marked as ‚Äòcritically endangered‚Äô or ‚Äòendangered‚Äô, 7 as ‚Äòvulnerable‚Äô, and another 7 as ‚Äònear threatened‚Äô.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Growing threat and possible solutions  The letter has also underlined the fact that more than half of 90 living marine mammals are marked as ‚Äòconcerning conservation status‚Äô by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today, the same slogan is being used to protect them from other forms of threats due to human activities, including plastic pollution, loss of habitat and prey, climate change, collisions with the ships, overfishing and even noise #pollution.  #Whales #Dolphins #MarineSpecies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚ÄúSave the Whales‚Äù campaign has been popular for decades. It began in the 1970s to put an end to commercial whaling‚Äîa process of hunting and killing whales for commercial use including meat, cosmetics, lubricant, and other products.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Back in September, the issue was discussed at the scientific conservation committee meeting of the International Whaling Commission, which has a core mission conservation of these magnificent creatures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The letter is part of a growing movement to raise awareness about the threats faced by whales, dolphins and porpoises.   #Whales #Dolphins #MarineSpecies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In fact, experts say that few of these species are already on the brink of extinction due to the lack of action and pollution as well as overexploited seas are the main reasons for this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Call for global action  The letter highlights that more than half of these marine species need conservation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Through the letter, the experts from 40 countries have called for global action to protect the whales, dolphins and porpoises from extinction.  #Whales #Dolphins #MarineSpecies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now, more than 350 scientists and conservationists have come together again to highlight the issue by signing a letter initiated by the Mammal Research Institute (MRI).   #Whales #Dolphins #MarineSpecies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many researchers and environmental activists have been raising their voices to protect these species and their habitat over the past several decades.  #Whales #Dolphins #MarineSpecies<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Lesser construction activities, lesser pesticide sprayings and decreased pollution during the lockdown are the reasons cited for the increase in the number of these butterflies across northern India.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As per reports, even Delhi witnessed uncommon butterflies like Tropical Indian Fritillary, Indian Jezebel, Common Mime, Common Shot Silverline, and Tawny Coster after almost several years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The data by the Uttarakhand forest department shows that until June this year, 134 forest fires have occurred across the state. In comparison to last year‚Äôs data‚Äî2,150 forest fires destroying around 3,000 hectares of forest‚Äîthis is significantly low.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In 2020, however, there were lesser forest fires and this factor acted as a catalyst for higher sightings of these rare moths and butterflies across the state.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the first time in the past several years that butterflies have been spotted in such high numbers in these low altitude areas, veteran entomologist Peter Smetacek and also the founder of Butterfly Research Centre in Bhimtal, told The Times of India.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Around the same time, another species named Aday-flying moth (achelura bifasciata), was sighted in Devalsari area near Mussoorie by one of the residents of the area, Arun Gour. This moth made its last appearance in 1893‚Äîmore than 125 years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the first time in 110 years that these beautiful butterflies were sighted on the western parts of the Himalayas, since they were generally limited to the eastern Himalayan region so far.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The researchers also revealed that the event was captured as soon as the star was ripped apart, thus providing a more clear view of what was behind the curtain of dust and other stellar debris.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As per the study, this burst of light is often very difficult to observe, as it is obscured by dust and debris. While in the process of eating a star, a #blackhole shoots back debris that obstructs the telescope's view.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once the star is stretched, it releases debris, which appears long and thin‚Äîjust like noodles. This shape is why the process is referred to as spaghettification.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scientists refer to this phenomenon as a tidal disruption event, which occurs when a star passes from the vicinity of a cosmic object like a supermassive #blackhole.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last year, these powerful #telescopes captured a rare blast of light released by the dying star when it was being eaten by the supermassive black hole.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Capturing the tidal disruption event  The study was made possible through the observations made using #ESO's Very Large Telescope and New Technology Telescope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This rare event was documented by the international team of #astronomers from the University of Birmingham.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"The idea of a #blackhole 'sucking in' a nearby star sounds like science fiction. But this is exactly what happens in a tidal disruption event," said Matt Nicholl, a lecturer at the University of Birmingham, UK, and the lead author of the study.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the closest star flare recorded to date, and it is also very rare, as stars getting spaghettification has not been much documented.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The area near northwest Delhi's Wazirpur recorded the highest #AQI at 379, followed by 364 in Dwarka Sector 8 and Mundka. Lodhi road logged the cleanest air in the capital city at 193.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As per the pollution control board, out of the 36 pollution monitoring stations, the #AQI in as many as 19 stations is in the 'very poor' category, 14 stations recorded the index in the 'poor' category, one recorded it in the 'moderate' category and two were non-functional.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #airpollution reaches a crescendo in Delhi-NCR every winter, when pollution from stubble burning combines with the suspended water droplets in the lower atmosphere to form a thick blanket of noxious smog, thus creating health hazards for the residents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #AirQualityIndex of the national capital turned foul and mounted to 'very poor' category at 304 on Tuesday morning, with northwest district recording the most polluted air, according to the Central Pollution Board's data.

<|startoftext|>Many of these regions are predicted to be vulnerable to drought impacts due to #climatechange.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The spatial distribution of drought studies shows there has been limited assessment in a large number of regions, including south and central America, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Oceania.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The researchers revealed that effects can be different in different soil types and different regions of the world.  #droughts #ClimateChange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"This review highlights substantial gaps in our global understanding of the effects of drought on wet soils and how they will respond to increasing drought," Mosley added.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"We have seen many examples of how the drought in the Murray-Darling Basin in Australia has caused major issues including acidification of soil and water due to acid sulfate soils exposure in wetlands," Mosley said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In some cases, #droughts can lead to very long-term (less than 10 years) and irreversible soil changes, with major impacts on water quality when soils are re-wet after the drought ends.  #ClimateChange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The review paper describes how drought often leads to severe cracking and compaction, acidification, loss of organic matter, and enhanced greenhouse gas (for example methane) emissions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to the researchers, wetlands can suffer "water droughts" both from the effects of a drier climate, and also when excessive water is extracted or diverted that would normally flow into them.   #ClimateChange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Wetlands around the world are incredibly important for maintaining our planet's biodiversity and they store vast amounts of carbon that can help fight climate change," said study author Luke Mosley from the University of Adelaide in Australia.  #droughts #ClimateChange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Published in the journal Earth-Science Reviews, the study highlights the many physical and chemical changes occurring during droughts that lead to severe, and sometimes irreversible, drying of wetland soils.  #droughts #ClimateChange<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is consistent with previous studies demonstrating significant links between maternal and child sleep quality during normal times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The researchers observed that mothers who reported higher scores of insomnia were also more likely to report that their children had poorer sleep quality and shorter sleep duration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moreover, 12 per cent of mothers even reported a positive change in their child's sleep quality, and 25 per cent reported an increase in sleep duration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>However, it is important to note that the majority of mothers reported no change in their child's sleep quality, duration, arrangement, and their perception of child's sleep as problematic, the researchers said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The researchers then computed a score representing the mother's perception of change in her sleep quality.  Moreover, the researchers found that about 30 per cent of mothers reported a negative change in their child's sleep quality and a decrease in sleep duration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the study, mothers were asked to complete a self-reporting questionnaire with reference to two-time points: (a) retrospectively one to two months before the COVID-19 outbreak in Israel (b) during home confinement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#COVID19 | The results, published in the Journal of Sleep Research, indicated that maternal clinical insomnia during COVID-19 more than doubled to 23 per cent during the pandemic, compared with only 11 per cent before the pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"In the study, we addressed consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and home confinement on maternal anxiety, insomnia, as well as reports of sleep problems among children," said study author Liat Tikotzky from Ben-Gurion University in Israel.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The Creek Fire in Fresno and Madera counties burned 333,880 acres as of Saturday morning, with 49 per cent containment.  The 56,338-acre Zogg Fire in Shasta County was 95 per cent contained as of Saturday morning, according to Cal Fire.  #Wildfires #californiawildfires<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On Friday, firefighters also responded to 19 new wildfires, quickly bringing full containment to all.  Meanwhile, the Glass Fire in Napa and Sonoma counties burned 67,484 acres as of Saturday morning, with 82 per cent containment.  #Wildfires #californiawildfires<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On a positive note, Cal Fire added that several of the fires were over 95 per cent contained and no growth is expected, yet full containment likely wouldn't be reached until rainfall occurs.  #Wildfires #californiawildfires<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The August Complex wildfire began when thunderstorms pounded the area between August 18-20.  Thirty-seven different fires were triggered by lightning, While many were contained, several others went on to merge and become one massive blaze.  #Wildfires #californiawildfires<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The blaze is currently raging across the counties of burning in Mendocino, Humboldt, Trinity, Tehama, Glenn, Lake and Colusa.  #Wildfires #californiawildfires<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Further, considering the C2 Orbiter continues to function optimally, the C3 mission will only consist of a lander and a rover.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>C3 is expected to retain the heritage of its predecessor while sporting a configuration that allows robust design and capacity enhancement for mission flexibility.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And while the failure to perform a soft landing on the lunar surface prevented the mission from being a 100% success, those incomplete objectives will soon be achieved through ISRO‚Äôs next lunar mission, #Chandrayaan3.  (üì∏:ISRO/IANS)  https://t.co/RSXAnSRYJ2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Chandrayaan3  Last year, the #Chandrayaan2 mission not only took India to the Moon, but it also made @isro a household name across the country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These radars can be used for Earth observation irrespective of the light and weather conditions of the area being imaged. RISAT-1A will provide continuity of service for RISAT-1, which was launched on April 26, 2012.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RISAT-1A will be the sixth in the series of #RISAT satellites‚ÄîIndian radar imaging reconnaissance satellites built by ISRO that provide all-weather surveillance using synthetic aperture radars (SAR).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RISAT-1A  The first of ISRO‚Äôs upcoming missions will be the Radar Imaging Satellite 1A, or #RISAT1A. A land-based mission, this remote sensing satellite‚Äôs primary application will be in terrain mapping and analysis of land, ocean, and water surface for soil moisture.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With a hunger to explore more and understand better, the Indian space agency has no intentions of slowing down any time soon. And while the COVID-19 pandemic may have delayed some plans to an extent, ISRO has some major projects lined-up just for the next two years.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>On this World Mental Health Day, health experts like Bhavana S hope that people will grow awareness and help each other to combat such governing public health challenges.   #WorldMentalHealthDay #letstalk #MentalHealth2020 #MentalHealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bhavana S recommends including various hobbies in daily schedule to keep oneself occupied. ‚ÄúPeople should always have one or two hobbies which they must follow every day to be stress-free and relaxed.‚Äù   #WorldMentalHealthDay #letstalk #MentalHealth2020 #MentalHealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In some cases, when a person is unable to cope, clinical treatments like medications (only doctor-prescribed anti-depressants) and psychotherapy (or talk therapy) becomes necessary.   #WorldMentalHealthDay #letstalk #MentalHealth2020 #MentalHealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the other possible treatments recommended by clinical experts is meditation. Moreover, sunlight is also a recommended solution to combat seasonal depression. Reportedly, music and art can also work as a therapy to treat SAD.   #WorldMentalHealthDay #letstalk #MentalHealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the case of Seasonal Affective Disorder as well, Vitamin D intake can significantly boost mental health. It regulates the function and behaviour of the brain while maintaining the amount of Serotonin produced in the body.   #WorldMentalHealthDay #letstalk #MentalHealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another important treatment to overcome weather-related mental health issues is Vitamin D. It is not just recommended for bone strength but also plays a vital role in overall health and immunity of a person.    #WorldMentalHealthDay #letstalk #MentalHealth2020 #MentalHealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Light therapy is more of a home remedy which can be followed by anyone from anywhere in the world. It is also one of the first treatments that doctors and researchers recommend to overcome SAD.   #WorldMentalHealthDay #letstalk #MentalHealth2020 #MentalHealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Possible solutions  The best treatment to overcome SAD is light therapy‚Äîa treatment was developed by Norman Rosenthal in the 1980s. It is nothing but facing a ‚Äúlightbox‚Äù for about 30 to 60 minutes a day throughout the autumn and winter season.    #WorldMentalHealthDay #letstalk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When there is less amount of sunlight outside, the brain does not know when to wake up and it keeps producing the sleep hormone called melatonin. Similar to this, on gloomy or rainy days, the brain produces very less serotonin, the happy hormone, making one feel unhappy or blue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SAD is believed to be connected with one‚Äôs waking and sleeping routine,which is controlled by the lightness and darkness respectively. The overcast sky can mess up one‚Äôs mental health by inducing a chemical imbalance in the brain.   #WorldMentalHealthDay #letstalk #MentalHealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About 5% of the US population is estimated to experience SAD every year with the symptoms lasting for about five months of the year, according to the American Academy of Family Physicians.    #WorldMentalHealthDay #letstalk #MentalHealth2020 #MentalHealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The symptoms of this disorder include fatigue, social withdrawal, hopelessness and depressive thoughts.   #WorldMentalHealthDay #letstalk #MentalHealth2020 #MentalHealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>During the winter months, when the nights are darker and longer, there are possibilities of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) among certain individuals. SAD, is a very common seasonal depression, which occurs in less sunny or gloomy weather conditions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The study was conducted based on data from the US and Mexico and noted that the suicide rates increased by 0.7% in the US and 2.1% in Mexico for 1¬∞C increase in a monthly average temperature.   #WorldMentalHealthDay #letstalk #MentalHealth2020 #MentalHealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seasons and mental health  A study by Professor Marshall Burke and his team from Stanford University, US, suggests that mental health can decline due to an increase in temperatures.    #WorldMentalHealthDay #letstalk #MentalHealth2020 #MentalHealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚ÄúA person‚Äôs mental state is affected by various reasons including economical, physical, situational, emotional as well as environmental. The weather or season can affect an individual along with all these factors too,‚Äù she says.   #WorldMentalHealthDay #letstalk #MentalHealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Each individual‚Äôs conception of ideal weather varies‚Äîfrom rainy to sunny, and from snowy to warm. Bhavana S, Assistant Professor and HOD of Psychology department in Surana College, Bengaluru, agrees that weather plays a huge role in affecting the mental health of an individual.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moods are based on the hormones produced in the body, and hence, the weather outside can have some serious impacts on the mood.  #WorldMentalHealthDay #letstalk #MentalHealth2020 #MentalHealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But did you know that weather and mental health are interlinked with one another? Yes! For instance, on a gloomy day, the body produces less happy hormones, because of which you feel unhappy.    #WorldMentalHealthDay #letstalk #MentalHealth2020 #MentalHealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Annually, October 10 is marked as the #WorldMentalHealthDay to create awareness on issues related to mental health. With the ongoing pandemic it has become extremely important to spread awareness about these crucial aspects that affect all of us.   #letstalk #MentalHealth2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Despite this, the burden of blindness is not shrinking but rising steadily. India needs timely action and mobilization to deal with this critical situation, said Dr Namrata Sharma, honorary general secretary, AIOS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Ophthalmology Society said that India is one of the major contributors to the crisis. However, most of the cases are still preventable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The World Health Organisation (WHO) states that around 30 crore people suffer from partial vision impairment and blindness around the world. The developing countries are the epicentre of the partial vision blindness as 85% of the cases are concentrated in these countries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The second Thursday of October is celebrated as the World Sight Day annually which aims to spread awareness about avoidable blindness and vision impairment. The WHO theme this year is #HopeInSight which focuses on eliminating avoidable visual impairment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"There is a dire need to spread awareness among the masses about the importance of timely detection of vision problems and curb the instances of preventable blindness," he added.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...but the damage caused on the optic nerve can be halted or slowed. With a huge burden of vision impairment in India, there is an immediate need to take preventive measures on a very urgent basis," said Sachdev.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Cataract is considered to be the no. 1 cause of blindness globally, which is preventable as well as treatable. Glaucoma cannot be cured completely...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...which are preventable or treatable," said Dr Mahipal Singh Sachdev, President AIOS &amp; Chairman, Centre For Sight Group of Hospitals.  The society also highlighted the importance of public awareness in tackling preventable blindness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"With changing lifestyle patterns and excessive usage of digital screens by people of all age brackets, there is an exponential increase in the number of patients suffering from mild to severe vision problems...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is an immediate need to take preventive measures on a very urgent basis, the society cautioned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Increased digital screen time amid the COVID-19 pandemic has further increased the rising burden of preventable blindness in the country, said the All India Ophthalmology Society (AIOS).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>All of them, starting from Aryabhata, were aware of this limitation and they always maintained that numerical calculations must be backed up by observations and suitable corrections should be made. The numerical methods developed in the process were again ahead of their times<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They could be accurately applied for about a couple of centuries on either side of the time of the respective astronomer, beyond that the precession of the earth would introduce noticeable errors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hits and misses of #SiddhanticEra  Where do we place all these works in the overall development of Astronomy? As far as positional calculations of planets or calculation of eclipses are concerned, these methods were far superior to any other civilisation at that time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Astronomers like #Brahmagupta (~600 CE), Lalla and Sripati agreed with #Aryabhata on timekeeping systems but were not in favour of his ideas like rotating earth. They mostly followed rules given in Surya Siddhanta and Brahmasphutasiddhanta (of Brahmagupta).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The 15th-century mathematician #Nilakantha, in fact, proposed an alternate model of the solar system (later independently proposed by Tycho Brahe) which gave the most accurate positional predictions for all planets till the invention of the Heliocentric model of Copernicus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Towards the end of Kerala School, they were using numerical methods, which we now teach under #calculus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most of the Astronomers of Kerala School of Mathematics (12th to 15th century CE) were part of this tradition. They all developed better and better techniques to calculate positions of planets with high precision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After this, the Siddhantic Astronomers of India almost split into two branches. Many accomplished astronomers followed Aryabhata in toto and wrote commentaries on Aryabhatiya e.g. his disciple Bhaskara I (Bhashya, c. 600 CE) or Nilakantha Somayaji (Aryabhatiya Bhasya, 1465 CE).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But sadly, no copy of Garga Samhita is available today and large uncertainty in the exact date of Surya Siddhanta would mean that it might have been written after Aryabhatiya.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Early texts  In terms of books, there is #Suryasiddhanta, a book which was written between 4th to 8th century CE. Early Siddhantic astronomers also mention another compilation called Garga Samhita.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He also argued that the movement of stars and planets that we see is just an effect of the earth‚Äôs rotation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>... gnomon based timekeeping devices, linear, quadratic, simultaneous and indeterminate equations, cause of day and night, rising of different zodiac signs, the shape of the earth, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Aryabhata: the humble astronomer  In just 121 verses, he covers calendrical system, large units of time, ratios of orbital periods of planets, tables of sines and cosines (needed for positions of planets), methods for measuring areas, arithmetic and geometric progressions...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>However, for nearly 1000 years starting since Aryabhata, Indian astronomers wrote specialised books about the mathematics behind the motion of planets and stars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Indian Astronomy in the Middle Ages looks very different from astronomy in prehistoric times. Before Aryabhata, we knew about astronomy mostly as a list of observations recorded or facts listed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>They also recommend people to avoid flying kites in the morning and evening which are a time when the birds are usually flying in the sky.

<|startoftext|>Possible Solutions  In order to minimise the risk, @peta  and Wildlife Trust of India (@wti_org_india) recommends people to use plain, cotton thread with no coating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kite-flying during lockdown  Ever since the nation-wide lockdown on March 24, most people have been staying indoors. To kill boredom, a lot of people have started spending their time flying kites along with children.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Manja: a deathtrap on skies  Manja is a sharp string or thread made out of crushed glass pieces, metal or other sharp substances to cut the opponent's kite string while kite-flying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As the winter migratory birds like Siberian Cranes, Greater Flamingo, Ruff, and Black Winged Stilt start their annual migration towards India in the coming months, the increasing trend of kite flying has the bird-lovers worried.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#KiteFlying is particularly popular during some festivals like Makar Sankranti, but post-pandemic kite-flying is said to be on the rise even on normal days. As the number of these artificial flyers increase, cases of bird injuries also spike.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But environmentalists have been warning for decades that the #Manja used as a thread for the kites are very dangerous for the flying creatures‚Äîthe birds. Yet, the efforts to minimise these deathtraps on the sky have been minimal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The lockdowns and movement restrictions enforced due to the #COVID19Pandemic have given people enough time to rejuvenate some childhood hobbies and join children in flying kites.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In their natural form, the scissors recognise DNA from viruses, but Charpentier and Doudna proved that they could be controlled so that they can cut any DNA molecule at a predetermined site.  #NobelPrize2020 #NobelPrize<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Together, they succeeded in recreating the bacteria's genetic scissors in a test tube and simplifying the scissors' molecular components so they were easier to use.  In an epoch-making experiment, they then reprogrammed the genetic scissors.  #NobelPrize2020 #NobelPrize<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Charpentier published her discovery in 2011. The same year, she initiated a collaboration with Doudna, an experienced biochemist with a vast knowledge of RNA.  #NobelPrize2020 #NobelPrize<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In plant breeding, researchers can give plants specific characteristics, such as the ability to withstand drought in a warmer climate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Instead, they discovered a molecular tool that can be used to make precise incisions in genetic material, making it possible to easily change the code of life.  Just eight years after their discovery, these genetic scissors have reshaped the life sciences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Charpentier from the Max Planck Unit for the Science of Pathogens in Berlin and Doudna from the University of California-Berkeley, started investigating the immune system of a Streptococcus bacterium, one idea was that they could perhaps develop a new form of antibiotic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This technology has revolutionised the molecular life sciences, brought new opportunities for plant breeding, is contributing to innovative cancer therapies and may make the dream of curing inherited diseases come true.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Researchers warn that if the same cycle continues, then the similar fire events may reoccur. However, the study shows that it might take centuries to millennia for such impacts to materialise, but the effect of uncontrolled climate change could be long-lasting and devastating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scientists compare the carbon dioxide emissions that are occurring today to that of the volcanic emissions millions of years ago. Projections suggest that the Earth will have similar amounts of carbon dioxide by 2100.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>During the OAE2 period, forest fires burned around 30-40 per cent of global forests in a span of one lakh years. The fires we witness today are more prevalent in dry conditions, unlike the OAE2 fires that prevailed even in wet regions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mirror to the future  The current research is aimed at understanding the link between carbon stored in the ocean to oxygen level and temperature in the atmosphere. It also tries to estimate the speed at which such a cycle occurs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Such imbalance in the atmosphere jeopardised the forest areas by fuelling intense fires, and even the humid and wet regions were not exempt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Driven by such events, the oceans around the world ended up with excess dissolved carbon and the atmosphere, in turn, became excess in oxygen almost one lakh years after the OAE2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Similar processes are said to be happening on Earth today. For example, excess fertilisers at the mouth of the Mississippi River leads to an algal bloom. Feeding on these algae, large volumes of microbes consume all the dissolved oxygen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a result, microbial respiration increased, and oxygen became scarce and almost absent in many parts of the ocean‚Äîa phenomenon called anoxia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The volcanic activity led to the presence of excess carbon. Approximately 50,000 years before the beginning of the OAE2 cycle, excess carbon in the atmosphere was brought down into oceans by plants and algae by photosynthesis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excess carbon led to #ragingfires  The presence of excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is said to have triggered this ferocious fire event around 94 million years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The research examined rock samples from more than 90 million years ago, which belonged to the age of Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 (OAE2)‚Äîthe period characterised by almost zero dissolved oxygen in the oceans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A new study by the University of Colorado at Boulder, USA, shows that millions of years ago, even wet forests were burnt by an intense fire that raged 30-40 per cent of global forests‚Äîall thanks to excessive carbon in the atmosphere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They say the past is the mirror of the future. If this turns out to be true in terms of Earth's climate, the prospect does not look promising.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The results conclusively prove that ancient hominins‚Äîcommon name for modern humans and the extinct members of our family tree‚Äîdeveloped sophisticated technologies using fire for making tools more than 300,000 years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scientists still have no clue how this skill of tool-making using controlled temperatures spread across different regions later on or how exactly they controlled fire. For the study, the researchers used a combination of spectroscopy and AI machine learning to analyse the tools.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The current study is one of the earliest evidence of the use of controlled fire.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Research also suggests that somewhere between 300,000-400,000 years ago, the primary prey of our ancestors also changed‚Äîfrom elephants to fallow deer‚Äîeither a result or cause for a switch in the toolkit used, towards finer artefacts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Earlier, studies have pointed at similar use of controlled fires to make tools around the same time in North African regions like Morocco.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The scientists replicated similar heat conditions in labs and found that controlling the heat levels of flint can improve blade production.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Examining the tools from Qesem Cave in central Israel, the researchers found that blades were heated to a lower temperature of 259¬∞C than flakes (413¬∞C), while the pot lids were exposed to an even higher temperature of 447¬∞C.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The current study conclusively proves that human ancestors did control fire at least 300,000 years ago in the Middle East region.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>However, it was unknown whether the exposure to fire was random‚Äîlike caught in the middle of a forest fire‚Äîor whether these early human ancestors controlled fire to create tools.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many burnt tools from the Late Lower Palaeolithic (420,000 to 200,000 years ago) also bear testimony to the fact that early humans in many parts of the world used fire during these periods.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Evidence suggests that Homo erectus‚Äîthe first human ancestor to spread across the world‚Äîmade use of the fire as early as a million years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Using the cutting edge technologies like the Raman spectroscopy and AI modelling, researchers at the Weizmann Institute of Science and Tel Aviv University in Israel found that early humans had a good understanding of the effects of heating the stone before flaking it into blades.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A new study, published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour, shows that human ancestors in the Levantine region‚Äîcountries along the eastern Mediterranean shores‚Äîused fire at controlled temperatures to make tools around 300,000 years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But, when did we start controlling the #fire? We may be getting closer to finding a definitive answer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Use of controlled fire was probably the most defining moment in the evolution of early humans. It was not just a mere technological advancement but was the starting point of everything we associate humans with‚Äîmigration, civilisation, culture or language.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>-They built stone burial chambers for their dead, sometimes made stone circles around their burials, while also creating large stone circles or erecting large stones in the middle of nowhere for no apparent reason.  -The Stonehenge in the UK is a famous example.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>-Another interesting aspect of some of these cultures is their use of large stones in their social practices. We refer to them as ‚Äúmegalithic cultures‚Äù (mega = large, lithos = stone).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In addition, they can also shed light on the black hole found at the centre of our #MilkyWayGalaxy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Through these findings and further research on the subject, humankind could better its understanding of enigmatic black holes, which can store tonnes of matter and swell into enormous sizes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The researchers believe that the discovered galaxies may just be the tip of the iceberg. The galaxies around the black hole are extremely bright, and therefore, more such clusters could very well be around, scientists believe.  #BlackHole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Therefore, these two‚Äîthe gas and the invisible dark matter‚Äîcould very well have combined to form the web-like structures where both the galaxies and black holes could evolve.  #BlackHole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Giant halos form large regions of invisible matter, which is believed to have attracted huge amounts of gas in the early universe.   #BlackHole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It came into existence when the universe was only 0.9 billion years old, and in this short time, it gained the masses of a billion Suns. Precisely how it expanded to become supermassive was quite puzzling for the researchers to figure out.  #BlackHole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How did the web-like structure form around the #BlackHole?  This black hole is said to be one of the first ones to have been formed from the collapse of the first stars during the early years of the universe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This entanglement of galaxies is located about 0.9 billion light-years away from the Earth, and its discovery was made possible through the help of European Southern Observatory‚Äôs Very Large Telescope (VLT) based in Chile.  #BlackHole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The study indicates that all the 6 galaxies were found trapped due to a cosmic web-like structure fueled through gas which, in turn, also feeds the black hole and makes it more massive. Together, the trapped galaxies stretch up to 300 times greater than the size of our #MilkyWay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These types of black holes are regarded to be the largest in terms of mass, and can be millions of times more massive than the Sun. In fact, the newly discovered supermassive black hole holds a mass of nearly a billion Suns.  #BlackHole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As per the latest study, this is the first time galaxies have been found tucked so close to each other around a supermassive black hole.   #BlackHole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But for the first time, astronomers have spotted six galaxies trapped around a supermassive black hole, appearing to form a spider web-like structure.  #BlackHole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing can escape the powerful cosmic monster black holes‚Äînot even light‚Äîdue to its strong gravitational pull that attracts nearly everything around the region.   #BlackHole<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"Human society has always been dependent on the seas. Failure to reach good environmental status for our seas and oceans is not an option," they noted.  #GlobalWarming  #climatechange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The report highlights that the message from recent EU and global assessments of the state of seas and oceans is 'we are not doing well'.   #GlobalWarming  #climatechange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GlobalWarming | Long-term evidence of global warming outlined in the report includes a decrease over 30 years of up to two days in the period of Baltic Sea ice cover and an acceleration in the global mean sea-level rise.  #climatechange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The report identified other major strains on the world's seas and oceans from climate change, including acidification caused by carbon dioxide uptake from the atmosphere, sea-level rise, loss of oxygen and sea ice retreat.  #climatechange #GlobalWarming<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Findings from the report, published in the Journal of Operational Oceanography, confirm record rises in sea temperatures.  #climatechange #GlobalWarming<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now the study authors are calling for improved monitoring to provide better data and knowledge. They argue this will help countries progress towards sustainable use of seas and oceans which are an essential source of food, energy and other resources.  #climatechange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the same year, a large mass of warm water occurred in the northeast Pacific Ocean, according to the report. This was similar to a marine heatwave‚Äîdubbed 'the Blob'‚Äîwhich was first detected in 2013 and had devastating effects on marine life.  #climatechange #GlobalWarming<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to the researchers, European seas experienced record high temperatures in 2018, a phenomenon which the researchers attribute to extreme weather conditions‚Äîa marine heatwave lasting several months.  #climatechange #GlobalWarming<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Ocean State Report revealed an overall trend globally of surface warming based on evidence from 1993 to 2018, with the largest rise in the Arctic Ocean.  #climatechange #GlobalWarming<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Data from the European Union's (EU) Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) will increase concerns about the threat to the world's seas and oceans from #climatechange.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The impetus for the study came after individuals made inflammatory comments, namely that wearing masks were putting lives at risk and finding out that no data on the effects of surgical masks on the gas exchange was available.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Patients with lung disease, in particular, should avoid getting infected and should wear a face mask, which, along with handwashing and social distancing, is proven to reduce the risk of #COVID19 infection, the authors wrote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The researchers stressed the importance of wearing a face mask to prevent #COVID19 infection. If a surgical mask is not available, a cloth mask with at least two layers is recommended by the CDC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An overly tight mask may also increase the feeling of breathlessness. The solution is simply to slow down or remove the mask if you are at a safe distance from other people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People with COPD, according to the US ATS Patient Education Fact Sheet on the disease, "must work harder to breathe, which can lead to shortness of breath and/or feeling tired."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The researchers assessed problems with gas exchange, ie., changes in oxygen level or carbon dioxide levels in healthy individuals as well as veterans with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD before and while using #surgicalmasks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The study published in the journal Annals of the American Thoracic Society shows otherwise. "We show that the effects are minimal at most even in people with very severe lung impairment," said study author Michael Campos from the University of Miami in the US.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>During the #COVID19Pandemic, the wearing of face masks has become a highly political issue with some individuals falsely claiming that wearing face masks may be putting people's health at risk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New research findings contradict statements linking wearing #facemasks to carbon dioxide poisoning by trapping #CO2.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>-While conducting these experiments, scientists simultaneously recorded nerve cell activity in birds‚Äô brains as well.   It was found that the nerve cells showed activity only when the birds responded to the visual stimulus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>-In some intriguing instances, the crows indicated that they saw something even when no visual stimuli were presented on the screen.   These observations indicated that the birds‚Äô eyes were, in a way, tricking them, which again points towards the presence of subjective reality.  https://t.co/Nsga88UWDw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>-When the stimulus was clear, the birds signalled that they saw it.   -But when the stimulus was dim, their responses varied; sometimes they reported that they saw it, and sometimes they didn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To examine consciousness in birds, the study, led by Professor Andreas Nieder, the chair of Animal Psychology at the University of T√ºbingen, involved two carrion crows (Corvus corone) that were trained to respond to a visual stimulus projected on a screen by moving their heads.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üß†Consciousness also has different levels.   -The most basic, primary level is sentience, which is the ability to have a point of view.   -The next level is sapience, the ability to hold a train of thought &amp; form opinions.   -The final,highest level is understanding of the self.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üß†Consciousness is a tricky subject when it comes to animals.   It is a trait known to be shared only by mammals and is attributed to the cerebral cortex‚Äîa region in the brain of humans and other mammals, which happens to be absent in bird brains.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>‚ö°Ô∏è ‚ÄúFirst Person Cured of HIV, #TimothyRayBrown, Dies from Cancer‚Äù   https://t.co/42SAcezXer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>However, Brown's story inspired scientists, patients and the world that a cure could eventually be found.  #TimothyRayBrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brown's cure was too risky and aggressive to be used routinely, and it remains principally a #cancer treatment. The approach is also too expensive for the 38 million people, many in sub-Saharan Africa, thought to be living with HIV infection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But the leukaemia that led to his HIV cure returned earlier this year and spread to his brain and spinal cord.  #TimothyRayBrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After the treatment, levels of HIV in Brown's blood fell to undetectable levels and he no longer needed anti-retroviral therapy. He was in effect "cured".  #TimothyRayBrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CCR5 is a set of genetic instructions that build the doorway that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) walks through to infect cells. Mutations to CCR5 essentially lock the door and give people resistance to HIV.  #TimothyRayBrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>-His treatment involved destroying his bone marrow, which was producing the cancerous cells, and then having a bone marrow transplant.  -The transfer came from a donor who had a rare mutation in part of the DNA called the CCR5 gene.  #TimothyRayBrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TimothyRayBrown, 54, who was born in the US, was diagnosed with HIV while he lived in Berlin in 1995. Then in 2007, he developed a type of blood cancer called acute myeloid leukaemia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>- It meant he no longer needed anti-viral drugs and he remained free of the virus, which can lead to AIDS, for the rest of his life.  - The International AIDS Society said Brown gave the world hope that an HIV cure was possible.  #TimothyRayBrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>- The first person cured of HIV, Timothy Ray Brown, has died from cancer.  - Brown, who was also known as "the Berlin patient", was given a bone marrow transplant from a donor who was naturally resistant to #HIV.  #TimothyRayBrown<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>But with such an enormous, urgent, and ever-increasing requirement for vaccines against the #coronavirus, which has so far infected 3.3 crore and killed 10 lakh people around the world, the number of sharks sacrificed for its production may even exceed the predicted number.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To protect the shark species, scientists have been actively working on a synthetic version of squalene made from fermented sugar cane.  #covid19vaccine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In fact, species like the gulper shark and the basking shark, which are rich in this oil, are already vulnerable, and if targeted further, they could be under some serious threat.  #covid19vaccine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>However, conservationists fear that this sudden spike in demand for mass production of vaccines will not just threaten the shark population, but may eventually lead to their endangerment as well, especially considering these top predators do not reproduce in huge numbers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>British pharma giant #GlaxoSmithKline, which has announced mass production of 100 crore doses of the #COVID19Vaccine, has already been using #sharksqualene to make flu vaccines.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As per estimates made by conservationists, around 30 lakh sharks are killed every year so that human beings can utilise #squalene in cosmetics, machine oil, and other products.   #covid19vaccine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While #squalene is also found in the livers of many other animals, sharks remain the major commercial sources for this natural organic compound.  #covid19vaccine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>However, if two doses are required per person, then the number of sharks would double to 5 lakh.  #covid19vaccine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now, #SharkAllies, a California-based conservation group, has warned that in order to create one dose of #COVID19vaccine each for every single person on the planet, about 2.5 lakh sharks will have to be killed for their liver oil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One such adjuvant is squalene, natural oil that is present in the liver of #sharks. However, it comes at the price of mass-murder‚Äîin order to obtain one tonne of squalene, approximately 3,000 sharks need to be killed.  #covid19vaccine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With the help of adjuvants, vaccines can produce more antibodies, and effectively arm consumers with longer-lasting immunity against the disease.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All vaccines consist of an immunological agent called adjuvant‚Äîmeaning "to help" in Latin‚Äîwhich makes the vaccine more efficient by strengthening its immune response.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Conservationists have warned that at least 5 lakh sharks are likely to be slaughtered in order to develop enough doses of an effective vaccine and immunise humankind against COVID-19.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>These findings highlight scenarios where COVID-19 could be spread through fine aerosol particles being circulated in an enclosed space.  #coronavirus #CoronavirusVaccine #corona #coronavirusoutbreak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Further, some of the bus passengers who later showed symptoms of COVID-19, the authors found, were not sitting close to the infected passenger.  #coronavirus #CoronavirusVaccine #corona #coronavirusoutbreak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even though the two groups later mixed in with the larger crowd at the worship event, the number of new cases attributed to the event were much lower, suggesting that the bus was the major point of transmission.  #coronavirus #CoronavirusVaccine #corona #coronavirusoutbreak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of the passengers who later got sick, the majority of them rode on the same bus as the source patient.  #coronavirus #CoronavirusVaccine #corona #coronavirusoutbreak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Both buses had closed windows and had air conditioning running, said Changwei Li, study co-author, but one bus carried a patient infected with the virus, and the other did not.  #coronavirus #CoronavirusVaccine #corona #coronavirusoutbreak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some of the attendees, it turns out, took two buses to the event creating a unique natural experiment for the researchers.   #coronavirus #CoronavirusVaccine #corona #coronavirusoutbreak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The research team worked with epidemiologists from two regional Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in China to trace infections following a large outdoor worship event in Zhejiang province.  #coronavirus #CoronavirusVaccine #corona #coronavirusoutbreak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to the study, published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, it was largely believed that close contact through droplets is a major route of transmission for COVID-19.  #coronavirus #CoronavirusVaccine #corona #coronavirusoutbreak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Our study provided epidemiological evidence of transmission over long distances, which was likely airborne," said study lead author Ye Shen from the University of Georgia in the US.  #coronavirus #CoronavirusVaccine #corona #coronavirusoutbreak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Researchers were able to link a community outbreak of #COVID19 in China to a source patient who likely spread the virus to fellow bus riders through the bus's air conditioning system.  #coronavirus #CoronavirusVaccine #corona #coronavirusoutbreak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A new research has added to the growing body of evidence that indicates airborne transmission of #COVID19 occurs more quickly in enclosed spaces.  #coronavirus #CoronavirusVaccine #corona #coronavirusoutbreak<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Animal Husbandry Department Deputy Commissioner Dr PD Kamble cautioned in a circular that since CCHF cases were found in some districts of south Gujarat bordering Maharashtra, it was likely to spread to this state.  #CongoFever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>....Anybody consuming infected meat may experience symptoms of high fever, head and body aches, nose-bleeding, stomach pains, red eyes etc," Vanare explained.  #CongoFever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Though much is not known about the disease, it is believed to spread through Hyalomma tick, a parasite which thrives on the blood or flesh of infected animals, fowls, or other birds...."  #CongoFever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>District Civil Surgeon Kanchan Vanare said that though there were no Congo fever cases yet in Palghar, precautions have been listed after infections of this disease were found in neighbouring Gujarat, which borders Talasari taluka in the district.  #CongoFever<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Therefore, the results could be different when the entire population is considered. In some countries like Ireland and Denmark, the opposite is true, since preterm deliveries have reportedly declined during the #pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On a positive note, most of the studies quoted here consisted of the smallest sample size and involved only hospitalised pregnant women.   #coronavirusoutbreak #covid19 #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A study in Maharashtra showed that more than 12 per cent of 1,140 pregnant women tested were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, demonstrating a substantial prevalence of the disease among pregnant women in India.  #coronavirusoutbreak #covid19 #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The study in New York also showed that obese women‚Äîespecially with body mass index (BMI) 30 or higher‚Äîhave a greater risk of severe #COVID19.   #coronavirusoutbreak #covid19 #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Other factors like obesity, sugar levels, pre-existing medical conditions and the immune response are also proven to have a link to COVID-19 severity.   #coronavirusoutbreak #covid19 #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The CDC surveillance data also suggests that pregnant women might be at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 compared to others. Therefore, health experts urge the utmost caution for pregnant women throughout pregnancy.  #coronavirusoutbreak #covid19 #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Factors affecting pregnant women  During pregnancy, the body‚Äôs immunity is suppressed to limit adverse reactions to the fetus. However, this natural response makes women vulnerable to infections.   #coronavirusoutbreak #covid19 #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A study in the UK published in the reputed journal JAMA in July shows that the pandemic has led to high rates of preterm births and cesarean delivery among women with SARS-CoV-2 infection.   #coronavirusoutbreak #covid19 #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Early deliveries, especially before 32 weeks, are proven to have higher rates of death and disability.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Preterm birth due to #COVID19  Preterm or premature birth is when a baby is born too early, much before the completion of the usual 37-38 weeks of pregnancy. A full course of #pregnancy is crucial for the complete development of different organs in a baby.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now, the latest data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health organisations suggest that pregnant women with #COVID19 might have an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as premature births or stillbirths.  #coronavirusoutbreak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It has been just over nine months since the first cases of #COVID19 were reported in #Wuhan in December 2019, and thanks to the relentless work of the global scientific community we are learning numerous new traits of the novel coronavirus every other day.   #coronavirus<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Could salt and water‚Äîthe two essential ingredients of human food‚Äîbe among the fundamental building blocks that cooked up the universe too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The researchers anticipate that by using more developed technology to closely explore the hot disks made of sodium chloride and hot water vapor, they can even obtain clues to understand the origin of our Solar System.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Astronomers will be able to study such molecules released from dust particles in greater detail using the next generation Very Large Array, which is currently in the planning stage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meanwhile, the presence of heated water vapour and sodium chloride, which were found to be released by the destruction of dust particles, go on to show just how hot and dynamic the discs around massive baby stars can be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In contrast, stars that are born as twins in a large common gaseous cloud tend to possess disks that rotate in the same direction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Further investigation revealed that the stars‚Äô circumstellar disks are rotating in opposite directions, which indicates that the stars aren‚Äôt actual twins, but strangers that were born in separate clouds and paired up later.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Other molecules such as methyl cyanide (CH3CN), which have been commonly observed in previous studies of massive young stars, were also detected further out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>During the examination of this stellar pair, the team detected radio emissions from a wide variety of molecules. In particular, molecules of sodium chloride (NaCl) and hot water (H2O) were found in the immediate vicinity, i.e. the circumstellar disk of each star.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The process of massive star formation, however, remains veiled, as their humongous distance from the Earth and the fact that they are surrounded by massive clouds prevent astronomers from obtaining clear views of their formation sites.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #universe is filled with countless stars‚Äîsome so small, they only have one-tenth the mass of the Sun, while others so massive, they weigh more than ten times our star.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Each star seems to be engulfed in a gaseous disk that possesses molecules of heated water vapour and sodium chloride, commonly known as table salt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A group of #astronomers has, only for the second time ever, discovered a pair of massive baby stars that are growing in what appears to be salty cosmic soup.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>On the other hand, river Congo in Central Africa is the deepest river on the planet. Precisely how deep it is remains a mystery, but experts state that it is nearly 230m deep in parts, which makes it deep enough to submerge London‚Äôs clock tower.  #WorldRiversDay2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some bonus trivia!  The river #Nile is known to be the largest river in the world, originating from #NorthAfrica and flows through 11 countries on the continent. It stretches to a whopping distance of 6,695km ‚Äì equivalent to 65,000 football fields.  #WorldRiversDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The highest Indian waterfall  In India, the highest waterfall is the Kunchikal Falls, situated on river Varahi in Shimoga district of Karnataka. The waterfall originates from the height of around 1493 ft.   #WorldRiversDay2020 #WorldRiversDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The construction of this dam started in the year 1978, but was only completed in 2006. The dam on the embankment of river Bhagirathi can produce hydroelectricity of 1,000 MW.   #WorldRiversDay2020 #WorldRiversDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Its staggering height also makes it a part of the top 10 tallest dams in the world.  #WorldRiversDay2020 #WorldRiversDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The highest dam in India  Tehri Dam is regarded to be the highest dam in India, built on the river Bhagirathi. It is located in the Tehri district of Uttarakhand, and built at a height of 260.5 metres.   #WorldRiversDay2020 #WorldRiversDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The area is also a famous kingdom of the Royal Bengal Tigers. The largest delta supports a diverse variety of flora and fauna, and is also home to over 4.5 million people.  #WorldRiversDay2020 #WorldRiversDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Largest delta in the world  The largest delta in the world is formed by two major rivers, viz. Ganga and Brahmaputra, which converge on the Bengal Basin. They together form the Sunderban Delta that spreads over India and Bangladesh with an area of approximately 40,000 square kms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is also regarded as the most sacred river to the Hindus, and flows through pilgrimage sites like Rishikesh, Haridwar, Varanasi, Allahabad, and Kolkata.  #WorldRiversDay2020 #WorldRiversDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the course of this long journey, the great river acts as a source of water for 11 Indian states, and supports a population of approximately 500 million people.   #WorldRiversDay2020 #WorldRiversDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The river rises from Uttarakhand and flows through a total distance of 2,525 km to end in the Murshidabad district of West Bengal.  #WorldRiversDay2020 #WorldRiversDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The sacred river  The Ganges or Ganga is a perennial river, originating from the great Himalayas and flowing throughout the year. It lives on the melting snow of the mountains.   #WorldRiversDay2020 #WorldRiversDay<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#MacquarieHarbour is regarded as the hotspot of such incidents because of its sloping and sandy shore areas. While coming near the shore, the whales usually get stuck on sandbanks and beaches along the remote Macquarie Harbour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To rescue these surviving #whales at least 60 people are required to pull back the large marine animals back into the water. As per reports, 400 carcasses of the whales will now be preferably disposed of in the sea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They usually travel in pods of 20-30 but sometimes it can be as big as 1,000 individuals in the single group. Female pilot whales usually lead the pod and guides others in the group towards food or any danger using echolocation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PilotWhales are not enlisted as an endangered animal and, as per estimates, have a population of one million long-finned and 200,000 short-finned pilot whales worldwide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moreover, these are also known to dive to 1,000 m, where these marine mammals can hold their breath for nearly 30 mins. Studies suggest that the female pilot whale can live up to 40 years or more, which is 10 years longer than a male mammal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PilotWhales can grow up to 22 ft long, with more than three tonnes of weight, and spend most of their time in deep oceans. The long-finned pilot whales consume squid and fish in the ocean at the depth of 200 m.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Experts have hypothesized several theories for this behaviour‚Äîsome highlight that the whales travel in search of fish for food and they end up coming towards shore, while others say marine noise and vibrations mislead them as they navigate and communicate through sound waves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The stranding numbers are often very large as most whales and dolphins usually travel in large groups. However, experts state that despite frequent stranding of these Cetacean species, the exact reason is not fully understood.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As per experts, more than 80% of the stranding in Australia takes place in Tasmania. Another large mass stranding was registered way back in 1935, where 294 whales were spotted stranded near the shore, while in 2009 about 200 pilot whales were spotted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This year‚Äôs stranding is regarded to be one of the largest globally. The last largest was recorded in 1996, where about 320 whales were beached in Western Australia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moreover, the rescuers have also stated that few exhausted pilot whales, which are currently stranded and cannot be dragged back into the waters will be euthanised. There are a total of four such whales that will be euthanized as per the latest reports.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>During the first count, about 270 whales were reported, but the later helicopter survey spotted another 200 whales on Monday. As per the government reports, 88 whales have been rescued so far and another 20 are likely to be guided back again into the water.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In an unprecedented and unfortunate incident, nearly 400 long-finned pilot whales have died due to stranding in Australia‚Äôs #Tasmania west coast. On record, it is regarded to be one of the biggest strandings of whales in #Australia.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Land management can enhance or compound climate-driven changes in wildfire risk, either through fuel reductions or fuel accumulation as an unintended by-product of fire suppression. According to the study, fire suppression efforts are made more difficult by #climatechange.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Natural variability is superimposed on the increasingly warm and dry background conditions resulting from climate change, leading to more extreme fires and more extreme fire seasons.  #climatechange #Wildfires<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The analysis of more than 100 studies published since 2013 showed a strong consensus that climate change promotes the weather conditions on which wildfires depend, increasing their likelihood.  #climatechange #Wildfires<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A switch to an economy supported by renewable energy sources is needed to avoid the worst impacts of climate change on fire risk.  #climatechange #Wildfires<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to the researchers, climate models indicate that fire weather will continue to rise this century in many parts of the world, and increasingly so for each added degree of global warming.   #climatechange #Wildfires<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The western US is among the regions where the trends in fire weather have been most pronounced in the past at least 40 years.  #climatechange #Wildfires<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>His own group's previous work revealed that certain changes in the numbers and types of #bloodcells during inflammation are associated with poor health outcomes in patients with diseases such as #heartdisease, #cancer, and #diabetes.  #coronavirus #coroanvirusoutbreak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Higgins noted that early reports from #China indicated that the body's inflammatory response was extremely intense in some patients and very mild in others.  #coronavirus #coroanvirusoutbreak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"We wanted to help find ways to identify high-risk #COVID19 patients as early  ‚Äî who are likely to become severely ill and which hospitalized patients are likely to get worse quickly," said study researcher John M Higgins from the Massachusetts General Hospital in the US.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A standard test that assesses blood cells can identify which patients admitted to hospital with #COVID19 could face a high risk of becoming critical and die, say, researchers.  #coronavirus #coroanvirusoutbreak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meteorologists rely on satellites for the data needed to forecast weather.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The signals from the 5G frequency bands potentially could leak into the band used by weather sensors on satellites that measure the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere and affect weather forecasting and predictions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Rutgers study used computer modeling to examine the impact of 5G "leakage" - unintended radiation from a transmitter into an adjacent frequency band or channel - on forecasting the deadly 2008 Super Tuesday Tornado Outbreak in the South and Midwest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This technology will revolutionize internet communication and telecommunication. It has faster connection times, increases the number of devices that can connect to a network and will be more widely available over the next two to three years, according to the researchers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to the study, presented at the 2020 IEEE 5G World Forum, fifth-generation cellular wireless technology (5G) stems from new, smarter ways to use the higher (mmWave) frequencies for mobile communications.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Researchers, including one of Indian-origin, now claim that upcoming 5G wireless networks that will provide faster cell phone service may lead to the inaccurate weather forecast.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The researchers compared these greening patterns with other factors and found that it's also associated with higher soil temperatures and higher soil moisture.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With this global view, 22 percent of sites greened between 2000 and 2016, while four percent browned, said the study.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only three percent showed the opposite browning effect, which would mean fewer actively growing plants. To include eastern Eurasian sites, they compared data starting in 2000, when Landsat satellites began regularly collecting images of that region.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While active plants will absorb more carbon from the atmosphere, the warming temperatures could also be thawing permafrost, thereby releasing greenhouse gases.  Between 1985 &amp; 2016, about 38 percent of the tundra sites across Alaska, Canada, western Eurasia showed greening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When the tundra vegetation changes, it impacts not only the wildlife that dependS on certain plants but also the people who live in the region and depend on local ecosystems for food.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, is the first to measure vegetation changes spanning the entire Arctic tundra, from Alaska and Canada to Siberia, using satellite data from Landsat, a joint mission of NASA and the US Geological Survey (USGS).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This drastic melt has triggered yet another alarm to combat the ongoing climate crisis, which is particularly affecting the poles and other vulnerable regions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In addition, people living near the #Arctic could be forced to relocate due to increasing temperatures and wildfires. The rising temperature of the ocean has already affected marine lives and other lifeforms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Due to Arctic ice loss, the dependent species like polar bears and seals face a huge risk as the climatic change will make the Arctic an unsuitable habitat for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Impact of ice loss  As per NSIDC, the rise in temperature and melting of ice could push the ice extent even lower, risking the region as well as life forms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Such unusually hot summers had a significant impact on the fragile #polarecosystems, including #wildfires and various other environmental disasters.  https://t.co/dNrc3ifKFZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For instance, #Siberia experienced an unusual period of high temperature in the first few months of 2020. Verkhoyansk, a town in #Russia, recorded a never-seen-before temperature of 38¬∞C on June 20‚Äîthe highest temperature recorded in the north polar region. S<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This year's Arctic temperature has been recorded warmer than average in a range of 8 to 10¬∞C as per NASA. This summer, parts of the Arctic recorded unusually high temperatures, which impacted the ice melt season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As per the WMO data, the annual surface air temperatures over the last four years (2016‚Äì2019) in the Arctic region have been the highest on record. In fact, the Arctic is warming nearly thrice as fast as the global average, as per the recent estimates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Arctic‚Äôs unprecedented warming  The Arctic is regarded to be one of the fastest-warming regions worldwide and is said to be heating at twice the global average.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As per NASA, 2020‚Äôs minimum extent was marked at 2.48 million square kms, which is recorded to be below the 1981-2010 avg of yearly minimum extents. According to National Snow and Ice Data Center the rate of ice loss between Aug 31 and Sept 5 was faster than during any other year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Before this, 2019 was marked as the second-lowest year after 2012, when the lowest of 3.4 million square km was recorded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The year-on-year minimum extent of Arctic sea ice has been dropping sharply in summer in the last 20 years. This is the second time when the ice has been measured below 4 million square kilometer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This point of reduction is also known as the annual sea ice minimum extent. To analyse this extent of sea ice cover reduction, researchers used various satellite data, which reported sea ice to be minimum at 3.74 million sq km on September 15, 2020.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SeaIceMinimum  Arctic‚Äôs sea ice undergoes seasonal patterns of change, which reduces (thin and shrink) during the summer and begins to grow again from September onwards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Following the unusually hot summer, scientists studying the seasonal melting of sea cover have now revealed that the Arctic‚Äôs ice cover shrank to the second-lowest extent in 2020, when compared to the last 40 years of recorded data.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This year, however, the warming over the north polar region witnessed a new high with some parts recording up to 10¬∞C warmer than normal temperatures.<|endoftext|>

Its working is similar to that of a pregnancy test. The paper strip will change its colour and generate two lines for positive diagnosis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The CSIR Research team was previously working under sickle cell mission for genome diagnostics and therapeutics, during which they realised that the same technology can be utilised to create a new testing kit for COVID-19.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This paper-based test strip has been developed by a research team from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and Tata Group, led by Debojyoti Chakraborty and Souvik Maiti.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Then, this Cas9-SARS-CoV2 complex is put on the paper strip with two lines‚Äîone control, one test‚Äîwhich help confirm or deny the viral infection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Feluda is also the world‚Äôs first diagnostic test to use a specially adapted Cas9 protein for the successful detection of the virus. The Cas9 protein is coded in a way that makes it interact with the SARS-CoV2 sequence present in the patient‚Äôs genetic material.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #COVID19-causing coronavirus is detected by CRISPR tests that use CAS12 and CAS13 proteins for diagnosis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This technology identifies a specific DNA sequence within the gene, and then, an enzyme acting as a molecular scissor is used to cut off the DNA sequence, thereby changing the DNA and tweaking gene function.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CRISPR‚Äîan acronym for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, a gene-editing technology‚Äîis used to fix gene defects.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The test uses indigenous #CRISPR gene-editing technology to recognise and target the genetic material of SARS-CoV2, the virus responsible for #COVID19.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is Feluda and how does it work?  #Feluda stands for FNCAS9 Editor Linked Uniform Detection Assay. The name is also a tribute to Satyajit Ray‚Äôs well-known fictional character of the same name‚Äîa private detective in a series of Bengali novels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#COVID19 tests that are currently being used take longer time for diagnosis, leading to delays. However, Feluda significantly reduces the diagnostic time, which will come in handy considering the nationwide COVID-19 case tally has been consistently rising at an exponential rate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Feluda, a low-cost, indigenously developed testing method that can detect the novel coronavirus accurately in less than 30 minutes, has been approved for commercial use by the Drugs Controller General of India.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>‚ö°Ô∏è ‚Äú#ClimateChange is Making Fishes and Reptiles Age Faster; Cutting Their Lives Shorter: Study‚Äù   https://t.co/RYwzvCIuBj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hence, better conservation measures must be implemented, and relocating species whose habitats are under risk due to rise in temperature must be seriously considered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Species that are already near extinction are under much more threat; as their populations are already very small, reduced life expectancy will only cause more harm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scientists also noted that the rapid aging of one species can have implications on other species that form a part of its ecological network. For example, fastened aging of ectothermic animals can affect the number of its prey, competitors, parasites, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Due to decreased lifespans, external events like severe flood, drought, or diseases will reduce the species‚Äô recovery capacity. This, in return, may further reduce the availability to these populations to produce enough offspring.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Telomeres provide protection to the coding sequences in the DNA, and every time a cell splits, it can lead to loss or shortening of telomeres. The rate of erosion of telomere is directly proportional to the rate of cell division and the level of oxidative stress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These #ectothermic animals, which cannot generate heat internally, are being immensely affected by increased global temperatures and heatwaves. The rising temperatures are increasing their body temperatures, causing them to age faster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As per the study, organisms that belong to the category of #ectotherms‚Äîanimals whose body temperatures change according to the environment‚Äîare experiencing heat stress and rise in growth rates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While alarming, these findings could play a vital role in improving our understanding of how climate change affects the ageing of certain species, which can further be used to devise better conservation plans for these animals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The rapidly changing climate is causing #fishes, #reptiles, and #amphibians to age faster while also decreasing their life expectancy, a new study has found.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ClimateChange is Making Fishes and Reptiles Age Faster; Cutting Their Lives Shorter: Study   https://t.co/8MjQh7xZkn  (üì∏: Adeline Marcos)  https://t.co/34MCSB3Foa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interestingly, the findings also make it clear that the power of friendship, which we human beings know ever so well, may have some deep evolutionary roots in the primate family tree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Therefore, this study on primates provides some refreshing as well as valuable insights into the overall male animal behaviour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>However, most of these observations are focused on females because, in most mammal societies, females tend to spend their entire lives in the same group, whereas the males keep on coming and going.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the last decade, similar patterns of friendship have been found in several animal species‚Äîfrom monkeys and horses to dolphins and killer whales.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Until now, it was believed that males only get friendlier with females in order to improve their chances of mating, ensure the protection of their offspring. But the new study has successfully shed light on another potential benefit that has nothing to do with reproductive perks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Male baboons spend very little time grooming each other, but the study did observe them grooming with females, and not just when the females are fertile.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When ‚Äòhanging out‚Äô, the male and female #baboons spent a lot of time grooming‚Äîa give-and-take activity that involves sitting close together and stroking through each other's fur, picking ticks and other parasites.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Social isolation, in fact, was found to be a bigger threat to male baboon survival than the stress and dangers of fighting their way up the pecking order.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The socially connected male #baboons were found to live longer lives, and the males that maintained strong female friendships were 28% more likely to make it to their next birthday than their socially isolated counterparts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Subsequently, the findings not-so-surprisingly indicated that both sexes benefited immensely from having strong social ties.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The research team analysed data for 277 males and 265 females to estimate the strength of the bonds in each baboon's social circles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Using these observations, along with statistical techniques to infer mortality risk at each age from sparse data, the team led by Susan Alberts‚Äîchair of the evolutionary anthropology department at Duke University‚Äîexamined the link between survival and friendship in baboons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since 1971, researchers have followed individual baboons in southern Kenya on a near-daily basis as part of the Amboseli Baboon Research Project, keeping tabs on the animals‚Äô socialisation patterns and how they fared over their lifetimes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A new study, which examined more than 540 #baboons in Amboseli National Park in Kenya and drew data spanning across 35 years, has found that male baboons that have close female friends enjoy higher rates of survival than those who don't.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Abu Dhabi is the capital of the United Arab Emirates and its second-most populous city after Dubai.  #IPL2020 #IndianPremierLeague @IPL #IPL #IPLWeather #ipl2020 #Dream11IPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi will host two matches over the next seven days: the opener on Friday and another clash between the MI and the Kolkata Knight Riders on Wednesday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hot and humid weather marks the climate of all three coastal cities hosting this year's IPL for most parts of the year.  #IPL2020 #IndianPremierLeague @IPL #IPL #IPLWeather #ipl2020 #Dream11IPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The IPL Venues  The shopping paradise Dubai is the most populous city in UAE, spreading over more than 4,100 sq. km. The Dubai International Cricket Stadium will host four of the seven matches over the next seven days: Sunday, Monday, Thursday and Friday.  #IPL2020 #Dream11IPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Therefore, the players could struggle with the hot and sultry conditions while the dew factor could affect bowlers, especially spinners, to grip the ball. The dew at night hours could make the outfield wet, slow and slippery.  #IPL2020  #IPLWeather #Dream11IPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>During the match hours, the humidity could be a significant factor as it crosses 70% as the Sun goes down. The dew point temperatures in all three venues vary between 23-25¬∞C at night time, while the minimum temperatures range between 26-28¬∞C.   #IPL2020 #IPLWeather #Dream11IPL<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The match time (6 pm to 10.30 pm local time) temperatures, however, are expected to remain in the range of 32-34¬∞C. Clear skies will prevail over the region during the match hours, from Saturday to next Friday, in all three locations.   #IPL2020 #IndianPremierLeague #IPLWeather<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The first matchday, September 19, is expected to be a hot day in Abu Dhabi, with a maximum temperature of more than 40¬∞C. Similar conditions are expected in Dubai and Sharjah as well. Over the next 7 days, maximum temperatures will range between 37 to 39¬∞C in all three venues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The conditions will remain sunny with no possibility of any rain throughout the month.  #IPL2020 #IndianPremierLeague @IPL #IPL #IPLWeather #MIvCSK #ipl2020 #Dream11IPL<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>‚ö°Ô∏è ‚Äú#SolarCycle25: Sun‚Äôs Activity Expected to Ramp-up by 2025 as Scientists Confirm Beginning of a New Cycle‚Äù - by @MrigDixit   https://t.co/pjPDX9C1DC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Sun periodically ejects hot plasma in the form of solar flares and winds across the solar system. Therefore, predicting the Sun's solar cycle is important to understand the space weather, radio communications on Earth, and as well as to keep satellites and astronauts safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doug Biesecker, a solar physicist at #NOAA‚Äôs Space Weather Prediction Center in a #NASA statement said, Solar Cycle 25 is anticipated to be as strong as the last solar cycle, which was a below-average cycle, but not without risk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As per @NASA, the Sun's activity may start increasing halfway through the cycle, as it approaches the maximum. Scientists are now expecting that the Sun‚Äôs activity will ramp up around July 2025‚Äîwhen there will be a sharp rise in the number of sunspots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But now, the research suggests that multiple factors led to this period of unusually cold weather, mainly the increased volcanic activity on Earth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Initially, the cold period was attributed to a decrease in the number of sunspots from cycle to cycle by British astronomers Annie Maunder and Edward Maunder and the period was called the Maunder Minimum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Iceland‚Äôs population fell by half over this period and in England, the River Thames froze.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Maunder Minimum  Any such event of low solar activity, however, doesn‚Äôt reduce the solar radiation drastically and have minimal impact on Earth‚Äôs climate. Between 1645 and 1715, unusually cold weather prevailed over Europe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last year also the presence of sunspots was very low in which nearly 281 days had no sunspots at all, prompting the debates over the declaration of a minimum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Over the last five decades, there have been four cycles when the Sun was unusually active. But the last solar cycle was comparatively weaker with lesser number of sunspots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The new solar cycle  The #Sun has entered its 25th solar cycle as measured by humans since 1755. As per the Solar Cycle 25 Prediction Panel, solar cycle 25 is more or less likely to be similar to the last one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Sun‚Äôs cycle has two main phases‚Äô solar maximum (most sunspots) and minimum (least sunspots) and the period from one minimum to the next is called a cycle.  (Image credit: NOAA/JPL-Caltech)  https://t.co/FJcaRjb9sW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unlike the constant poles of #Earth, the magnetic poles on Sun switch places in a time interval of 11 years. Scientists track this solar cycle through changes in the Sun's activity occurring at its surface, mainly in the form of a temporary number of sunspots on its surface.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sun‚Äôs solar cycle and sunspots  Our sun is a gigantic ball of electrically charged hot gas, which is in a continuous motion. This movement gives rise to the changes in #Sun‚Äôs magnetic field, which consists of two poles just like the magnetic bar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Solar minimum is the phase in which the magnetic activity on the Sun drops significantly marked by least number of sunspots.  (üì∏:NASA)  https://t.co/C1eT2ckHEu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #SolarCycle25 Prediction Panel of international experts stated that the solar minimum occurred in December 2019. However, it took nearly 10 months to calculate and confirm the minimum due to Sun‚Äôs variability.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now, in 2020, scientists have confirmed that the Sun has just entered a new cycle, named the #SolarCycle25.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If we do discover signs of life on such a dwarf-orbiting planet, its implications could be ginormous, considering most stars, including our Sun, will one day perish and end up becoming white dwarfs themselves.  @NASAWebb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Furthermore, the James Webb Space Telescope (@NASAWebb) is set to launch in the latter half of 2021 and begin this search.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At present, #NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite is actively looking for such rocky planets around white dwarfs. If and when such a world is found, Kaltenegger and her team have developed the models and tools to identify signs of life in the planet's atmosphere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And while the planet that was discovered turned out to be a gas giant, and therefore, incapable of sustaining life, its existence alone suggests that smaller rocky planets capable of supporting life could exist within the habitable zones of white dwarfs.  @NASAWebb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since the discovery of the first transiting giant planet orbiting a white dwarf (WD 1856+534b) earlier this week, we know that planets do revolve around such ‚Äòdead‚Äô stars.   @NASAWebb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moreover, the #JamesWebbSpaceTelescope, which is uniquely placed to find signatures of life on rocky exoplanets, will play the most vital role in this hunt.  @NASAWebb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"If rocky planets exist around white dwarfs, we could spot signs of life on them in the next few years," said Lisa Kaltenegger, the corresponding author of the study, associate professor of astronomy in the College of Arts and Sciences, and director of the Carl Sagan Institute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Their comparatively smaller size allows astronomers the rare opportunity to characterise rocky planets when they transit across their respective dwarfs.  @NASAWebb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When stars like our Sun die or exhaust all its fuel, all that remains of them is an exposed core‚Äîreferred to as a white dwarf. These white dwarfs tend to be about 100 times smaller than our Sun, and roughly the same size as Earth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Researchers from the USA's Cornell University, in a new study, have shown how @NASA's upcoming #JamesWebbSpaceTelescope, which is set to be launched in October 2021, could be used to find signatures of life on Earth-like planets orbiting white dwarfs.  @NASAWebb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And while scientists argue whether this phosphine is evidence for microbial life on #Venus, another group of researchers has devised a potential method to hunt for life outside our solar system‚Äîon planets orbiting dead stars!  #phosphineonvenus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Following the recent discovery of phosphine in the clouds of #Venus, intense debates over the presence of life on our neighbouring planet are once again underway in full force.   #phosphineonvenus<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>As humanity recovers a devastating pandemic, the path ahead is to take lessons and inspiration from our battle against ozone depletion and build back a better future.  #WorldOzoneDay #OzoneDay #OzoneLayer (Image credit: N Kanaka / BCCL, Visakhapatnam)  https://t.co/iQbCDYyNvQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moreover, a depleted ozone layer results in increased warming due to higher influx of solar radiation. Also, the substances that deplete ozone possess very high global warming potential, hence leading to increased atmospheric warming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Due to global warming, the temperature of the stratosphere is falling gradually, leading to the formation of more stratospheric clouds over Antarctica, and hence delaying the recovery of the Ozone Hole.   #WorldOzoneDay #OzoneDay #OzoneLayer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Link to climate change  Climate change, global warming and ozone depletion are all linked intricately as every change in atmosphere influences each of these phenomena.   #WorldOzoneDay #OzoneDay #OzoneLayer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By the mid-21st century, a complete recovery of the ozone layer is expected.  #WorldOzoneDay #OzoneDay #OzoneLayer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As per the US Environmental Protection Agency estimates, the implementation of the Montreal Protocol could avoid 443 million cases of skin cancer, 2.3 million skin cancer deaths, and 63 million cataracts in the United States alone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every inch of the layer is being tracked regularly now, and the phasing-out of CFCs has helped it‚Äôs recovery to a large extent.  #WorldOzoneDay #OzoneDay #OzoneLayer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now, we have learnt a lot more about the ozone over the past three decades, and know that many parts of the world experience seasonal fluctuation in the ozone layer.   #WorldOzoneDay #OzoneDay #OzoneLayer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>September 16, the day when Montreal Protocol was signed in 1987, is celebrated as International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer since 1994.   #WorldOzoneDay #OzoneDay #OzoneLayer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still, it contained no legally binding goals for ODS reductions. However, the ozone hole story caught the attention of the public who feared skin cancer, cataract and many ecological consequences of ozone depletion.  #WorldOzoneDay #OzoneDay #OzoneLayer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Road to recovery  In March 1985, world leaders met in Austria the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Vienna convention was signed, calling for more research on the ozone layer.  #WorldOzoneDay #OzoneDay #OzoneLayer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Their research showed that within a decade, the ozone layer had lost one-third of its thickness over the south polar region‚Äîwhat came to be known as the #AntarcticOzoneHole.  #WorldOzoneDay #OzoneDay #OzoneLayer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shockingly, in 1985, Joe Farman, Brian Gardiner and Jonathan Shanklin reported a large decrease in stratospheric ozone levels over the #Antarctic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While the science behind the ozone layer is a century old, it was only by the 1970s that scientists started to notice the impact of CFCs on this roof of life.   #WorldOzoneDay #OzoneDay #OzoneLayer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In 1913, French scientists Charles Fabry and Henri Buisson discovered that the ozone collects in a layer in the stratosphere, roughly 18 km above Earth‚Äôs surface.   #WorldOzoneDay #OzoneDay #OzoneLayer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The experiment produced a strange slightly pungent-smelling chemical that, in the 1830s, a German-Swiss chemist Friedrich Sch√∂nbein named as ‚Äòozone‚Äô, meaning ‚Äòto smell‚Äô in Greek.  #WorldOzoneDay #OzoneDay #OzoneLayer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Following this discovery, several experiments were conducted with oxygen, and one particular experiment of passing electricity through oxygen gave up some intriguing results.   #WorldOzoneDay #OzoneDay #OzoneLayer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The ‚Äòhole‚Äô story  The story goes back to 1776 when a French chemist named Antoine Lavoisier first proved that oxygen is indeed a chemical element.   #WorldOzoneDay #OzoneDay #OzoneLayer<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Over the decade, several missions to Venus, including India‚Äôs Shukrayaan-1, have been planned by space agencies across the globe. The present discovery is likely to give a fresh impetus to exploration missions to the shiny planet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To further explore the origin of phosphine in Venus‚Äôs atmosphere, scientists suggest that more observations and modelling are the need of the hour.   #PhosphineOnVenus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They explored sunlight, micrometeorites, volcanoes, minerals, and lightning to explain the origin of phosphine, but none of these natural ways could fit the bill.  #PhosphineOnVenus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The results of the study suggest the presence of phosphine in Venus‚Äôs clouds, but the quantity is scarce‚Äîin the range of 20 parts-per-billion. Despite a long attempt to trace the source of the gas, the researchers were unable to reach a conclusion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The scientists made the discovery using the observations from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in 2017 and 2019, respectively.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An international team of astronomers, led by Professor Jane Greaves of Cardiff University, is credited with this path-breaking discovery.   #PhosphineOnVenus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moreover, Venus‚Äôs clouds are highly acidic, and phosphine would not last long in such conditions. Therefore, if there is indeed a microbial life on Venus, it will be very different from what we see on Earth, so as to survive in hyper-acidic conditions.  #PhosphineOnVenus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The surface conditions of the rocky planet Venus is not conducive to life as we know it. However, scientists say that the environment of its upper cloud deck‚Äîaround 53‚Äì62 km above the surface‚Äîcould be mild enough to support life.   #PhosphineOnVenus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scientists, however, argue that the detection of phosphine in itself is not enough evidence for microbial life, and it only indicates some unknown geological or chemical process that we haven‚Äôt understood yet.  #PhosphineOnVenus<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>.@NASA has already started to invest in asteroid exploration missions to extract valuable resources and it is just a matter of time that humanity aims to reach the exoplanets too. When the time comes, these shiny planets could be the centre of attraction in the upcoming centuries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The presence of these exotic worlds was once imagined in only science fiction‚Äînow slowly coming to reality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As per the study published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters in 2012, the surface temperature of this exoplanet reaches a whopping 2,150 degrees Celsius‚Äîideal conditions for diamond formation in this carbon-rich exoplanet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First-known diamond-rich exoplanet‚Äî55 Cancri e  Earlier astronomers dubbed 55 Cancri e‚Äî an exoplanet twice the size of planet Earth‚Äîto be one of the candidates that support perfect conditions to create diamonds in its core.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As compared to our Earth, the #exoplanets are not geologically active and the atmospheric conditions are, therefore, unlikely to support any form of life as we know it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But are these exoplanets habitable, like #Earth?  Well, evidence of life as we know it is yet to be found beyond planet Earth. However, the initial research strongly indicates that carbon-rich planets may not hold properties to support life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The experiments proved that with high heat and pressure, the silicon carbide reacted with water to produce diamonds and silica.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This theory factually proves formation of diamond-rich composition amongst exoplanets. In order to scientifically test this hypothesis, the team mimicked interior of carbide exoplanets using high heat and pressure environment, utilising high-pressure diamond-anvil cells in a lab.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the other hand, the star systems with high carbon to oxygen ratio‚Äîwhere carbon is more abundant than oxygen‚Äîcould host carbon-rich exoplanets, as per the study. Our planet Earth holds 0.001% of diamonds in its core.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Presence of #diamonds  A star with a lower carbon to oxygen ratio, like the Sun, have planets like the Earth‚Äîcomprising silicates and oxides with a very small diamond content.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The new study suggests that some among these could be carbon-rich planets, and given the right circumstance, their core could be made of diamond.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To date, astronomers have confirmed the presence of more than 4,000 exoplanets using several powerful space telescopes like the US space agency #NASA‚Äôs Hubble, TESS, and Kepler.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚ÄòExo‚Äô is derived from Greek, which means outside and that‚Äôs why the name exoplanet for any planet outside our solar system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now, scientists have deduced that the universe could be much ‚Äòricher‚Äô than previous estimates, with the presence of diamonds in the core of several exoplanets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The universe is home to trillions of intriguing celestial objects, most of which are yet to be discovered and explored. The most common, yet fascinating among these are the exoplanets‚Äîtypes of planets that orbit a star other than our Sun.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ranching and farming are common in the Pantanal, but many residents also depend on tourism generated by the jaguars, who have grown accustomed to people viewing them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Winds were blamed for carrying sparks into Encontro das Aguas and igniting the fires that affected the jaguars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The region is used to fires during the dry season, but those who work in the Pantanal say extreme drought, combined with heat and wind, have created a dire situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two hundred of them have already been killed, injured, or displaced due to the fires, according to Panthera, a big cat conservation group.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fires reached the park in recent days after scorching more than 8,900 square miles of land across wetlands known as the Pantanal, which starts at the southern end of the Amazon forest and stretches over parts of Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay, Agence France-Presse reported.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The jaguars are concentrated in a state park called Encontro das Aguas, or Meeting of Waters.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>All in all, getting a complete picture of how these moons influence each other is crucial, as it could shed light on how Jupiter‚Äôs wonderful moon system evolved as a whole, and also improve our understanding of how ocean worlds in compact systems evolve.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>However, this current model functions on the assumption that the tidal resonances never get too extreme. In future studies, Hay and his team of researchers intend to see what happens when they lift that constraint, and also study the true depth of the oceans within these moons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Subsequently, these #moons begin experiencing more heating than that caused by Jupiter alone, and in extreme cases, it could also result in the melting of ice or rock internally, especially on Io.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This leads to the generation of fast-flowing tidal waves, which effectively release significant amounts of heat into the oceans and crusts of Io and Europa.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As the tides generated by other moons resonate with a moon‚Äôs frequency, they serve as an energy source and excite the subsurface lunar oceans near their natural frequencies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was only when the researchers added in the gravitational influence of the other moons that they started to see tidal forces approaching the natural frequencies of the moons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For any #moon to experience tidal resonance, their oceans must be tens to hundreds of kilometers thick. Incidentally, the oceans on Jupiter‚Äôs moons are so thick, that the planet‚Äôs influence alone is incapable of creating tides with the right frequency to resonate with the moons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The tidal heating is what causes the interiors of the moons to heat-up, and it is driven by a phenomenon called tidal resonance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Essentially, the researchers have found that the moons gravitationally tug at each other and create friction‚Äîa process called tidal heating‚Äîwhile Jupiter itself stretches and squishes them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But now, a new study has found that moon-moon interactions may be more responsible for the heating than the Gas Giant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Previously, researchers believed that #Jupiter was the sole reason behind most of the heating associated with Io's internal ocean of magma as well as the liquid interiors of its three icy Galilean moons: #Europa, #Ganymede, and #Callisto.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Despite being so far away from the #Sun, #Jupiter‚Äôs moons are hot‚Äîhotter than they should be! The beautiful, icy moons are known to contain interiors warm enough to host oceans of liquid water.   #IcyMoons<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Answering this puzzling question, scientists propose that fast-moving dust particles might initiate the release of surface borne water molecules, thus allowing water to mix with iron.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>However, this research focused on the water found otherwise in the lunar surface instead of just on the poles as the hematite was discovered far from this frozen ice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Researchers extensively studied the data obtained from the Moon Mineralogy Mapper instrument onboard spacecraft. The presence of water has been only detected on the poles of the lunar surface in the form of frozen water, which remains almost entirely in shadow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The mission is credited with discovering clues of water ice on the poles of the Moon along with mapping out different types of minerals formed on the lunar surface.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs where the data from Chandrayaan 1 again comes into play. Researchers used the data obtained by the Indian space agency‚Äôs maiden Moon mission‚Äîwhich remained functional till August 28, 2009.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Missing clues: presence of water on Moon By now, scientists were able to decode the presence of oxygen, iron for the rust formation. But one most important element to carry this reaction was still missing i.e., water.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As per NASA, the Moon is slowly moving away from the Earth for billions of years and getting an inch farther almost every year. ‚ÄúSo, it's also possible that more oxygen hopped across this rift when the two were closer in the ancient past,‚Äù added the statement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As per the statement from @NASA, the magnetotail blocks about 99% of the solar winds during certain phases of the Moon's orbit‚Äîspecifically in the full Moon phase.  #Chandrayaan1 @isro<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In addition, the magnetotail interferes with the hydrogen molecules released from the solar wind to reach the Moon atmosphere, which if reached may inhibit this rust formation.   #Chandrayaan1 @isro<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Therefore, the terrestrial oxygen can reach the near side of the Moon facing the Earth and this finding means that the oxygen from Earth may be driving the formation of hematite on the lunar surface.  #Chandrayaan1 @isro<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Back in 2007, Japan's Kaguya orbiter helped scientists discover that oxygen from Earth's upper atmosphere can travel through magnetotail to the Moon, which is 3,85,00 kilometres away from the Earth.   #Chandrayaan1 @isro<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Therefore, researchers say the Earth‚Äôs magnetotail‚Äîan elongated region of the planet‚Äôs magnetosphere‚Äîplays a significant role in this change observed over the Moon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The airless Moon may lack atmosphere to support the formation of oxygen, but it hosts traces of oxygen that travels from Earth to reach the lunar environment.   #Chandrayaan1 @isro<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>However, it had the opposite effect since hydrogen is a reducer‚Äîwhich donates electrons instead of taking it. Therefore, solar winds may not be the reason behind rusting on the Moon‚Äôs surface.  (Image credit: @NASA)  https://t.co/VkQwg26oGP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Role of #Earth‚Äôs atmosphere  For iron to convert into rust it needs oxidizers, which can steal electrons from the iron and thus initiate rust formation. To understand the cause, the team examined the bombarding of hydrogen from the solar wind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Researchers noticed this phenomenon on the Moon while examining data from the Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) instrument onboard ISRO‚Äôs Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft. The data obtained from the M3 revealed the Moon's pole had a different composition as compared to its surface.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The lunar surface is littered with iron-rich rocks, which may facilitate this chemical reaction when combined with the other two elements. The #Moon does not have any rich source of water and is devoid of #oxygen in its atmosphere.  (Image credit: @NASAGoddard/Aaron Kaase)  https://t.co/7ZuJWNOjxD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The formation of rust or iron oxide can be attributed to the presence of two key elements‚Äîwater and oxygen‚Äîwhen they come in contact with iron.   #Chandrayaan1 @isro<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Data from the #ISRO has revealed that the Earth‚Äôs natural satellite Moon might be rusting. The new research suggests that the moon is turning slightly red, indicating the formation of a reddish-black mineral form of iron named hematite on its surface, particularly at the poles.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In fact, no large object is likely to strike the #Earth any time in the next several hundred years as best as we can tell, says NASA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As per the estimates from @NASA, no large space rock is currently on a collision course with Earth. Therefore, the probability of a huge asteroid hitting Earth is quite slim.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two students from the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay‚ÄîKunal Deshmukh and Kriti Sharma‚Äîhave been credited with the discovery.  @iitbombay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Soon after its discovery, the asteroid was declared the closest asteroid to fly past Earth, without falling into the Earth. As per #NASA, it flew 2,950 kilometres above the southern Indian Ocean.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Near-Earth Objects are those that travel within the 50 million km of the Earth orbit. Just a fortnight ago, a car-sized space rock, named 2020 QG, passed by our planet on August 16.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On its closest approach, #2020QG5 will be more than 29 lakh kilometre away from the #Earth and is not expected to pose any threat to Earth. Currently, it is in the constellation of Pegasus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2020 QG5  The asteroid 2020 QG5 is smaller than 2011 ES4 and is approaching Earth again after 16 years. On a relativistic coordinate time scale, this asteroid will approach around 5:30 TDB on September 1. The last time this asteroid approached Earth was on August 11, 2004.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #asteroid was first discovered in the spring of 2011 and passed by Earth every nine years. A 'potentially hazardous asteroid' is currently defined based on parameters that measure the asteroid's potential to make threatening close approaches to the Earth, according to NASA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This time, it will be closer to our planet than before, and the chances of spotting it, especially with a telescope will be very high.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@NASA estimates the asteroid's relative speed at around 8.16 km per second, Xinhua reported. The last time asteroid 2011 ES4 flew by Earth, it was visible from ground for four days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Will #asteroid 2011 ES4 hit Earth? No! 2011 ES4's close approach is 'close' on an astronomical scale but poses no danger of actually hitting Earth," #NASAAsteroidWatch posted on #Twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ruling out a possible threat, the US space agency said that the space rock would not hit Earth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In fact, this is reportedly the closest approach of such a large asteroid over the next ten years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2011 ES4  The 'potentially hazardous asteroid' 2011 ES4 will be 1.2 lakh km away from Earth at its closest approach on September 1. It means the asteroid will be closer to Earth than the Moon, which is 3.84 lakh km away from our home planet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Both asteroids, officially named #2011ES4 and #2020QG5, are classified as near-Earth objects but are not expected to pose any harm to Earth on their approach.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two #asteroids with an estimated diameter between 19 and 49 metres will pass by Earth on Tuesday, September 1. While both of them are relatively large, only one of them will be very close to Earth in terms of astronomical distances.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>All in all, these wonderful creatures are of immense value to nature and a lot of its inhabitants‚Äîincluding us human beings‚Äîand hence, they must be protected, studied, and valued at all costs. They are the heroes nature needs, and also deserves, at any point in time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Therefore, apart from helping the environment directly, bats also provide an indirect service by functioning as proxies that help scientists diagnose the health of an ecosystem.  #InternationalBatNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Increased environmental stress can also suppress bats‚Äô immune systems, and therefore, a higher prevalence of diseases in these mammals could directly point at alterations in their environments.  #InternationalBatNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They function as valuable bioindicators  Bats are excellent ecological indicators of habitat quality, and their size, mobility, longevity, taxonomic stability, population trends, and distribution grants them enormous potential as bioindicators to the existence of contaminants.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guano also functions as a soil conditioner and enricher, while improving the soil‚Äôs drainage and texture. It controls nematodes (plant-parasitic worms) in the soil and can be used as a natural fungicide too.  #InternationalBatNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They nourish and fertilise the soil  Bat excrement, also known as guano, is considered among the world‚Äôs finest natural fertilisers. It contains high concentrations of limiting nutrients like nitrogen, phosphate, and potassium.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the USA alone, bats help reduce the cost of pesticide applications by a figure in the range of $3.7‚Äì$53 billion per year, and that‚Äôs excluding the costs associated with the ill-effects of pesticides‚Äô impacts on ecosystems.  #InternationalBatNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But the species also consists of some stand-outs such as the Mexican free-tailed bats, who are known to consume an estimated one million kilogram of corn earworm moths‚Äîthe most costly agricultural pest insects‚Äîeach night!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On a typical night, a bat consumes the equivalent of its own body weight.   #InternationalBatNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Earthworms may be farmers‚Äô best friends, but bats closely follow with their natural pest-controlling abilities, which keep farms pest-free while simultaneously reducing the need to use harmful pesticides.  #InternationalBatNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They also belong to the limited groups of animals that naturally prey upon mosquitoes; the northern long-eared bats are especially famous for suppressing mosquito populations through direct predation.  #InternationalBatNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They devour pests and insects  Over two-thirds of all bat species are insectivorous mammals that consume insect species during twilight and night hours from different habitats such as forests, grasslands, agricultural landscapes, aquatic, and wetland habitats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plant-visiting bats also help pollinate some crucial plant species in terms of biomass in their habitats, which include columnar cacti and agaves‚Äîthe dominant vegetation elements in arid and semi-arid habitats.  #InternationalBatNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While bat pollination is relatively less common when compared to bird or insect pollination, it involves an impressive number of economically and ecologically important plants such as bananas, mangoes, and guavas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They also cover long distances during their nightly flights‚Äîfrugivorous bats can disperse seeds up to 1-2‚Äâkm away‚Äîand scatter far more seeds across cleared areas.  #InternationalBatNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fruit-eating bats are known to play an extremely important role in forest regeneration. And unlike other birds, they tend to defecate or spit out seeds during flight, effectively facilitating seed dispersal in clear-cut strips.   #InternationalBatNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are long-distance pollinators and seed dispersers  Bats play a vital role in helping plants reproduce by functioning as seed dispersers and pollinators.  (Pic: A. Prathap/BCCL Chennai)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But misconceptions and misjudgments aside, bats are extremely crucial to the environment and provide some invaluable ecosystem services that aid plants, animals, and even us human beings to a great extent.  #InternationalBatNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the fact that the #COVID19-causing SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses were present among these flying mammals for decades has put bats at an increased risk of being seen as an enemy species.  #InternationalBatNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Owing to their unusual appearance, nocturnal nature, and association with blood-sucking vampires, bats are among the most misunderstood creatures on planet #Earth.   #InternationalBatNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saturday, August 29, marks the celebration of the International #BatNight‚Äîan annual observance held on the final weekend of #August to celebrate bats, create awareness around them, and promote their conservation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>‚û°Ô∏èConsidering recent instances, it remains to be seen just how long it lasts to be one of the most productive terrestrial ecosystems of the planet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚û°Ô∏èThe fires usually occur during the dry season in Brazil but are also largely linked to illegal practices wherein people clear lands for cattle grazing or burn-off felled trees after illegally acquiring valuable wood.  #AmazonFires<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even last year, a record 80,000 fires were reported across Brazil by August, a 77% year-to-year increase for the same tracking period.  #AmazonFires<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚û°Ô∏èAs per Brazil‚Äôs Space Research Institute, the deforestation activity from August 2019 to July 2020 increased by nearly 34%, while the number of fires from July 2019 to July 2020 rose by 28%.   #AmazonFires<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In order to control the forest fires, the Brazilian government, back in July 2020, banned any fire activity for 120 days in the Amazon and Pantanal regions. But even this ban was unable to prevent or control the raging fires in the precious ecosystem.  #AmazonFires<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚û°Ô∏èOne of the largest forest fire incidents was reported on August 17, which burned nearly 25,605 acres of land‚Äîwhich amounts to about 14,500 football fields. The blaze was detected near the Xingu River in the Amazon state of Par√° in Northern Brazil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚û°Ô∏èFurther, as per Mongabay, of the total forest fires detected this year, 83% were reported from deforested areas, while over 12% were in intact forests that cover a total area of 1,73,000 acres.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...have occurred in just the past two weeks of August 2020, while the first ten days of August reported about 10,136 blazes (total small and big fires) across the forest.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Experts state the results of the study reveal a worst-case scenario prediction laid down by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) several years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moreover, melting ice in #Antarctica and #Arctic can lead to ecological imbalance, thus impacting the biological health of the glacier ecosystems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SeaIce plays a role in reflecting back about half of the incoming radiation from the Sun. Once the soil or sea is exposed to direct sunlight they tend to absorb much higher heat content as compared to the ice-covered land, eventually increasing the warming of the planet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apart from the sea-level rise, the melting of ice has direct implications on Earth as well as it enhances the solar radiation absorption.   #ClimateAction #ClimateEmergency #ClimateChange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Experts attribute rising global temperatures as the primary cause of such massive ice loss, which can impact millions of people living in the coastal parts of the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The study is rare in nature as it analysed the loss of ice in the entire planet, whereas most of the studies till now focused on ice melting in particular regions like #Antarctica, #Arctic, #Himalayas or #Greenland.   #ClimateAction #ClimateEmergency #ClimateChange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cascading impacts on the #Earth system  For the current study, scientists studied planet poles, mountains, and glaciers using data from various satellites to estimate the amount of ice lost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Therefore, the latest findings corroborate that it‚Äôs the need of the hour to minimise on greenhouse emissions‚Äîthe prime factor for the increase in global temperatures.  #ClimateAction #ClimateEmergency #ClimateChange   (Image: Antarctica Landscape) (Image credit: NOAA)  https://t.co/QkB72LvzLB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The study concluded that all the aforementioned areas have witnessed significant ice reduction in the last three decades and the trend is likely to continue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As per the study, the surface temperature has increased by 0.85¬∞C since 1880‚Äîthe result of it has been reflected in the rise of both sea and atmospheric temperature thus triggering a massive reduction in the ice cover of the world.   #ClimateAction #ClimateEmergency<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After, examining these prime hotspots, scientists have warned that the melting of glaciers and ice sheets can possibly increase sea level by nearly a metre (3 feet) by the end of the century.  #ClimateAction #ClimateEmergency #ClimateChange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The data was combined using satellite observations and numerical models. Moreover, the study added, about 60% of the ice loss was from the northern hemisphere, while the remainder of 40% was recorded from the southern hemisphere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>... mountain glaciers (6.2 trillion tonnes), and Southern Ocean sea ice (0.9 trillion tonnes).  #ClimateAction #ClimateEmergency #ClimateChange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ice loss across the globe  As per the current study, between 1994 - 2017, the ice loss among the various parts of the world is estimated to be: the Arctic sea ice (7.6 trillion tonnes), Antarctic ice shelves (6.5 trillion tonnes) and ice sheets (2.5 trillion tonnes)...  (üì∏:NOAA)  https://t.co/njg4iq4jg9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The current study shows that the #Greenland ice sheet has lost around 3.8 trillion tonnes of ice within 23 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another recent study had revealed last week that Greenland broke the all-time record annual ice-loss in 2019. With a loss of massive 532 million tonnes in one year, 2019 broke the previous record set of 2012 by 15%.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A recent study has estimated that #Earth, in whole, lost a staggering 28 trillion tonnes of ice between 1994 and 2017. The study, still under review and discussion, comes from researchers from the University of Leeds, University of Edinburgh and University College of London.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Over the last few decades, the accelerated irreversible melting has been a prime indicator of #globalwarming and is posing a massive threat to the entire world in the form of rising sea-levels.  #ClimateChange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Melting and refreezing of ice around the globe is an annual natural phenomenon, but owing to the gradual rise in global average temperature, the cycle is no longer marked by just the seasonal variability.   #ClimateChange<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The researchers are hopeful that the study will encourage policymakers to act on the reduction of #AirPollution in highly polluted regions like #India and #China.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a next step, the researchers are planning to involve more experts and the National Institute of Health, to explore the possibility of clinical trials to compare heart health and the level of air pollution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The results could have a significant contribution in responding to severe heart attack and other such cardio-related risks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"The good news is that these effects were reversible, at least in our experiments. Once the #airpollution was removed from the environment, the mice appeared healthier, and the pre-diabetic state seemed to reverse," said Dr Rajagopalan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Both the #pollution-exposed group and the high-fat diet group showed insulin resistance and abnormal metabolism‚Äîsimilar to a pre-diabetic state.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In its statement, the University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center explains that the mouse model study involved three groups: a control group receiving clean filtered air, a group exposed to polluted air for 24 weeks, and a group fed a high-fat diet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The research team has shown exposure to #AirPollution can increase the likelihood of the same risk factors that lead to heart diseases, such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the present research, the results show that air pollution can be added as a risk factor for the development of such cardiometabolic diseases similar to an #unhealthydiet and lack of #exercise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The evidence for the cardiovascular effects of air pollution can lead to heart attack and stroke and cardiometabolic diseases like diabetes is also growing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AirPollution is the deadliest environmental hazard in the current times, with an estimated death toll of more than 90 lakh per year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fine #pollution particles have been strongly linked to risk factors for several diseases like lung cancer, heart failure, Alzheimer's and other chronic diseases.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Concentrated particles like this develop from human impact on the environment, such as automobile exhaust, power generation and other fossil fuels."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"In this study, we created an environment that mimicked a polluted day in New Delhi or Beijing," Dr Rajagopalan said. "We concentrated fine particles of #AirPollution called PM2.5.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The study shows that air pollution was a 'risk factor for a risk factor' that formed the underlying cause of fatal problems like heart attack and stroke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A team of researchers from the Case Western Reserve University and John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in the US, led by Indian-origin scientist Dr Sanjay Rajagopalan, made the discovery.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In a first-of-its-kind study, researchers have found that air pollution can play a role in the development of cardiometabolic diseases such as #diabetes. Moreover, the study also shows that living in a polluted region was comparable to eating a high-fat diet.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>‚û°Ô∏èAs per researchers, it was not big enough to cause damage to the planet. In fact, asteroids of this size ten to fly past Earth at similar proximity about once a year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚û°Ô∏èSoon after spotting the asteroid, the ZTF team reported their findings to the International Astronomical Union Minor Planet Center, after which several telescopes followed up to learn more about the rock's size and orbit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚û°Ô∏èEvery day, this facility captures nearly 1,00,000 images of streaks that are left by the asteroids that speed across the sky. The researchers noticed five such streaks in the data as potential asteroids, and later on, one of them was confirmed to be the asteroid 2020 QG.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚û°Ô∏èThe asteroid was spotted using a wide-field sky astronomical survey facility named Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Based in California, it uses a telescope to view and find rare asteroids that may go unnoticed by other telescopes.  https://t.co/Jvx6YWMbcJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Deshmukh had been scanning that day's images along with Kriti Sharma, also a student at IIT-B, and Chen-Yen Hsu at the National Central University in Taiwan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚û°Ô∏èAccording to the official statement from IIT Bombay, the asteroid 2020 QG was identified by Kunal Deshmukh, a final year student in the department of Metallurgy and Materials Science.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚û°Ô∏èThe previously known record-holder is asteroid 2011 CQ1, which passed above Earth at about 2,500 kilometers higher than 2020 QG.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚û°Ô∏èSoon after its discovery, the asteroid was declared to be the only asteroid to fly past Earth at such close proximity.   As per NASA, it flew 2,950 kilometres above the southern Indian Ocean.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üååThe car-sized space rock, named 2020 QG, passed by our planet on Sunday, August 16. Its discovery has since created a lot of buzz around the world, as scientists had no clue about this passerby until it crossed us.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>-It has been noted by experts that throughout human history, mosquitoes are said to have killed more people than all the wars combined.  #StopTheSpread #Mosquitoes #WorldMosquitoDayü¶ü<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As per the Malaria Institute of India, about 100 million people suffered from malaria in India in 1935, and approximately one million deaths occurred annually in endemic areas.  #StopTheSpread #Mosquitoes #WorldMosquitoDayü¶ü<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>-Way back in 1852, the disease caused an epidemic in West Bengal, as per the Indian Journal of Medical Research (IJMR).   #StopTheSpread #Mosquitoes #WorldMosquitoDayü¶ü<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>-Vector-borne diseases account for more than 17% of all infectious diseases. They can be caused by either parasites, bacteria or viruses and spread through vectors like mosquitoes and fleas.  #StopTheSpread #Mosquitoes #WorldMosquitoDayü¶ü<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>- #Mosquitoes are said to be responsible for the death of anywhere between 5 to 50 percent of approximately 108 billion people who have ever lived on Earth. Even today, these tiny insects claim more than 7,00,000 lives every year. #StopTheSpread #Mosquitoes #WorldMosquitoDayü¶ü<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>- The first known remedy of malaria dates back to the early 1600s. It was derived from the bark of the cinchona tree and is known as quinine.  #StopTheSpread #Mosquitoes #WorldMosquitoDayü¶ü<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pf has the capability to totally invade and destroy the red blood cells in the liver. P. vivax is another one that poses a very high threat.  #StopTheSpread #Mosquitoes #WorldMosquitoDayü¶ü<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>-Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) is the deadliest parasite among the five known types of Plasmodium‚Äîa type of protozoa‚Äîwhich infect humans and cause malaria.   #StopTheSpread #Mosquitoes #WorldMosquitoDayü¶ü<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>-Only female #Anopheles mosquitoes can cause malaria, since male mosquitoes do not bite animals. Anopheles mosquitoes need human blood to enable maturation of their eggs.  #StopTheSpread #Mosquitoes #WorldMosquitoDayü¶ü<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>-The world #malaria is a combination of two Italian words‚Äîmal and aria‚Äîthis means bad air. While the world mosquito is derived from Spanish, which means ‚Äòlittle fly‚Äô.  #StopTheSpread #Mosquitoes #WorldMosquitoDayü¶ü<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DidYouKnow | A female mosquito can produce eggs up to 10 times in her life span of just two months.  (Image credit: SL Shanth Kumar) #StopTheSpread #Mosquitoes #WorldMosquitoDayü¶ü  https://t.co/uVr9yTbgXu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Less-known facts about mosquitoesü¶ü  - Female mosquitoes produce 100-300 eggs at a time on a still-water surface and these hatch within 48 hours. The larvae grow into adult mosquitoes within two weeks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In most cases, the disease can be easily treated and therefore, upon experiencing the symptoms, one must get tested immediately.  #StopTheSpread #Mosquitoes #WorldMosquitoDayü¶ü<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A #malaria attack goes through 3 stages in the human body‚Äîthe cold stage, the hot stage, and the sweating stage. The most common symptoms of the disease include headaches, vomiting and nausea, chills, sweats and body aches.   (Image credit: Aniruddhasingh Dinore / BCCL, Nagpur)  https://t.co/t6uO7V0HeB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The cases of malaria shoot up sharply during the #monsoon season, as mosquitoes have enough sources to breed and expand their population within a very short time.  #StopTheSpread #Mosquitoes #WorldMosquitoDayü¶ü<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Malaria is typically caused by the parasite called #Plasmodium carried by female Anopheles mosquitoes. These vectors transmit the disease mainly by biting a person.   (Image credit: C Suresh Kumar/BCCL, Chennai)  https://t.co/IWG3gLBYsH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Worldwide, nearly 3,500 species of #mosquitoes have been identified, while in India alone, there are over 400 species, and almost all of them carry diseases.  #StopTheSpread #Mosquitoes #WorldMosquitoDayü¶ü<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Transmission of mosquito-borne disease  #Mosquitoes are the most common vectors that transmit several diseases like Zika virus, West Nile virus, Chikungunya virus, dengue, and malaria.  https://t.co/kxsfrp9raU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The non-profit organisation, @MalariaNoMore has also launched a new national campaign ‚ÄòBite ko mat lo lite‚Äô this year. The campaign has been launched across 21 states of India and aims to educate people, to take necessary precautions against mosquito bites.  @malarianomoreIN<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>With the new instrumentation in place, the neuronal activity of a locust exposed to an explosive smell was resolved into a discernible odour-specific pattern within 500 milliseconds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally, the researchers optimised the system for transmitting the locusts' brain activity by attaching electrodes in a way that didn't hinder their movement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But to seek out a bomb, just the ability to detect and discriminate between different explosives isn‚Äôt enough; a locust would also have to know from which direction the odour is emanating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Using this data, the researchers were able to observe similar patterns when they exposed the locusts to vapours of a chemically diverse set of explosives, including TNT, DNT, RDX, PETN, and ammonium nitrate.  (üì∏: Raman Lab)  https://t.co/lmD8uXsfiz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>However, Raman and his fellow researchers were able to optimise a previously developed biorobotic sensing system that could detect the locusts' firing neurons and convey that information in a way that told researchers about the smells the locusts were sensing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Researchers from the Washington University in St. Louis, USA have successfully managed to hijack a locust's olfactory system to get the insect to detect as well as discriminate between different explosive scents‚Äîall within a few hundred milliseconds of exposure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>However, that very perception could not only improve, but also turn on its head thanks to a new study, wherein a group of researchers has managed to transform these insects from all-devouring pests to bomb-sniffing biorobots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be it biblical ages or modern times, locusts have been perceived as evil, demonic beings that only leave a path of destruction behind.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>‚ö°Ô∏è ‚ÄúAstronomers Discover First Look-Alike of Our #MilkyWayGalaxy in Early Universe‚Äù   https://t.co/acAtnnZCce<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The discovery is significant for understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies. Moreover, it can also shed light on the early years of the Universe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gravitational lensing is a phenomenon where the light emitted by a distant galaxy passes through a massive object and the gravitational force from that object bends or distorts the light, causing it to appear magnified.  https://t.co/nQtisTKhpb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This breakthrough discovery comes from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) of telescopes, based in Chile.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As compared to the Milky Way, it does not have a spiral arm. However, the galaxy‚Äôs rotating disc and a bulge‚Äîa large group of stars packed together around the galactic centre‚Äîwere among the similar features to our Milky Way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Astronomers have identified SPT0418-47 as a dynamically cold, but highly star-forming rotating disk in a galaxy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Astronomers till now, have believed that during the early years of the universe most the galaxies which formed were unstable and turbulent.  Contrary to this belief, this newly discovered galaxy was ‚Äòsurprisingly unchaotic‚Äô.  https://t.co/HuRs36Ahx7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The newly discovered galaxy was formed when the universe was just 10% of its current age‚Äîabout 1.4 billion years old.  A galaxy comprises gas, dust &amp; billions of stars‚Äîheld together by gravity. Milky Way galaxy that holds the entire solar system‚Äîis about 13.51 billion years old.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Astronomers have spotted a look-alike galaxy our Milky Way with a close resemblance.   The newly found galaxy named SPT0418-47 is estimated to be located about 12 billion light-years from our galaxy, it is so far that its light takes nearly 12 billion years to travel &amp; reach us.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Russia is facing international scepticism due to its fast approach in developing the vaccine.  #RussianVaccine #covid19 #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meanwhile, of the six COVID-19 vaccine candidates that have reached the Phase 3 level according to the WHO, three are from China and the other three include the ones developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, Moderna, and one jointly developed by Pfizer and BioNTech.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Russian Health Minister Mikhail Murashko had earlier said that clinical trials of the vaccine developed by the Gamaleya National Research Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology of the Russian Healthcare Ministry were over.  #RussianVaccine #covid19 #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The results clearly showed that all volunteers had a clear immune response resulting from vaccination, the ministry said, adding that there were no side effects or abnormalities in the work of the volunteers.  #RussianVaccine #covid19 #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On August 3, a "final medical examination" of participants in clinical trials of the vaccine took place at the Burdenko Main Military Clinical Hospital, the Russian Defence Ministry had earlier said in a statement.  #RussianVaccine #covid19 #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The vaccine has been jointly developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute and the Russian Defence Ministry.  #RussianVaccine #covid19 #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Russia said on Monday that it was going ahead with its plan to register the world's first COVID-19 vaccine this week before it starts mass vaccination in October, despite safety concerns raised from several quarters, including @WHO.   #RussianVaccine #covid19 #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Russia's coronavirus cases rose by 4,945 to 8,97,599 in the past 24 hours, but the new daily cases spike dropped below the 5,000-mark for the first time since April 23.  It is the fourth worst-hit nation by the pandemic after the US, Brazil and India.  #RussianVaccine #covid19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The number of global coronavirus cases has surpassed the 20 million-mark, while the worldwide death toll has increased to over 7,34,000, according to data released by the Johns Hopkins University.  #RussianVaccine #covid19 #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Putin pointed out that "some people did not have any symptoms at all" after getting a vaccine shot.  #RussianVaccine #covid19 #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"After the second shot, she had a slight fever again, and then everything was fine. She is feeling well and has a high [antibody] count," the President informed.  #RussianVaccine #covid19 #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I know this very well, because one of my daughters got vaccinated, so in this sense, she took part in testing," Putin said.  #RussianVaccine #covid19 #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Putin informed that one of his daughters tested the Russian COVID-19 vaccine on herself and she is feeling well.  The Russian President has two daughters‚ÄîMaria, who was born in 1985, and Katerina, who was born in 1986.  #RussianVaccine #covid19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"As far as I know, this morning for the first time in the world a vaccine against the novel coronavirus infection was registered," Putin was quoted as saying as he opened a meeting with the state officials.  #RussianVaccine #covid19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In what could alter the course of the #COVID19Pandemic that is still creating mayhem across the world, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday said the country has registered the world's first COVID-19 vaccine that "forms stable cell and antibody immunity".  #RussianVaccine<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#PerseidMeteors shower gets its name from the fact that the point from which they appear to hail lies in the constellation Perseus‚Äîan autumn constellation of the northern sky.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moreover, the best part is sky grazers don‚Äôt need any particular equipment to watch the meteor shower. It can be easily seen through the naked eye and is visible all over the sky.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To catch the glimpse of the shower, one must select a location that is free from air and light pollution. The brightness of the meteor shower may be impacted due to the moonlight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will #PerseidMeteorShower be visible in India?  Yes, provided one has a clear sky and less pollution. The stunning celestial event will be visible in India on August 11 and August 12. The visibility of the meteor shower will be maximum around 2 AM to pre-dawn hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The nucleus of the comet is noted to be about 26 km wide. Reportedly, at its peak, Perseid meteors shower can result in 60-70 meteors in an hour.  #PerseidMeteorShower<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This particular meteor shower is regarded to be an annual event as the Earth passes through the path of this large comet between July 17 to August 24.   #PerseidMeteorShower<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Perseid meteors shower is caused by debris left behind the Comet Swift-Tuttle. The debris can travel to our planet‚Äôs atmosphere at a velocity of around 130,000 miles per hour.  #PerseidMeteorShower<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The meteoroids travel at high speeds into the atmosphere and burn up resulting in the bright streak of light. This is known as the meteor shower.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What causes meteor showers?  Meteors are basically part of meteoroids, which are space objects composed of dust and range in various sizes. When these meteoroids enter the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere they are referred to as meteors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>However, many parts of India may not have a clear view owing to monsoon clouds. Moreover, the Perseid shower is clashing with a half-moon, and the bright moon may dampen the night show.  #PerseidMeteorShower<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On Tuesday and Wednesday night, the highest number of meteors‚Äîthat appears like a shooting star‚Äîwill grace the night sky of India, especially between 2 am to pre-dawn hours.   #PerseidMeteorShower<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Regarded to be the year‚Äôs brightest meteor showers, it will peak on Tuesday, August 12, but will be visible throughout from August 11 to 13.  #PerseidMeteorShower<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After the month-long show of comet #NEOWISE, skywatchers are all set to experience yet another spectacular celestial phenomenon‚ÄîPerseid Meteor Shower‚Äîthis month.   #PerseidMeteorShower<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>From the iconic Pyaar Hua Ikraar Hua to Rim Jhim Gire Saavan to Ghanan Ghanan, the Hindi film industry has embodied the many moods of monsoon in myriad ways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bollywood, based out of the monsoon hotspot Mumbai, has never lacked in portraying the beauty of rains and serving the romanticism around monsoons to its devoted audience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The monsoon music trend does resonate extremely well with the people across the Indian subcontinent. The demand for rain songs skyrockets across music platforms like Smule during the monsoon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In a country where the people and cultures are so deeply intertwined with a season, celebrating this nature‚Äôs gift on the silver screen seems obvious. Indian musicians have indeed captured the feel of monsoon in countless memorable ways for nearly a century now.  https://t.co/vQGZSP3hSJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People across India celebrate the monsoon, not just on their mobile apps, but with every possible avenue of daily life. And the sound of rains, thunder and lightning is something very few can resist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Indian classical musical mode #MalharRaaga is also closely associated with torrential monsoon rains. Even today, monsoon rains induce a strong sense of creativity and passion for artists and music-lovers alike.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üåßÔ∏èThe intricate relationship between music and monsoon is truly timeless. In the fifth century, the dark monsoon clouds inspired KƒÅlidƒÅsa to compose the epic Meghad≈´ta.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Tigers can imitate other animals for prey  The wild cats can easily mimic the call of other animals, this helps to successfully attract prey. Usually, they create a ‚Äòpook‚Äô sound of bears, thus creating a good trap.  #InternationalTigerDay2020 #InternationalTigerDay #TigerDay  https://t.co/sDFZuQEHQC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The main vocalisations of a tiger include roaring, growling, hissing, moaning, and chuffing. This majestic creature‚Äôs vocal chord is built in the shape of a square, which allows tigers to be extra loud. Their roars can go up to 114 decibels, as deafening as the jet engine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Their roars are LOUD!  A tiger‚Äôs roar is so loud that it can be heard from as far as three kilometres away. Moreover, one of the scientific studies revealed, the roar can also paralyze the other animals, especially some of its prey.   #InternationalTigerDay2020 #TigerDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>During these initial days, the cubs only follow the scent of their mother and are completely dependent on her for food and protection. They continue to tag around their mothers until they are about 24 weeks old.  #InternationalTigerDay2020 #InternationalTigerDay #TigerDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The newborn cubs can‚Äôt see  The tiger cubs are born blind, and they only open their eyes six to twelve days after their birth. Even after that, they do not get their complete vision for at least another couple of weeks.  https://t.co/hy7C2AmhFX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A surprising fact about these apex predators is that they can easily swim across rivers at a stretch several kilometres.  #InternationalTigerDay2020 #InternationalTigerDay #TigerDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They have been observed to enjoy staying in water for longer durations, and are excellent swimmers. This in-built talent is enabled by their webbed toes, which makes it easy for them to push a greater volume of water.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tigers have webbed toes  Unlike most cats, tigers love swimming and playing in the water. In fact, such is their love for water that they seem to have adopted a semi-aquatic lifestyle by living around the water bodies.   #InternationalTigerDay2020 #InternationalTigerDay #TigerDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The stripe patterns are unique to each wild cat. And that is how surveyors distinguish between two different tigers during the census. The gorgeous stripes run across the width of their body, and it is not just fur which displays this stripe feature, but the tiger‚Äôs skin as well.  https://t.co/NQH3RxfXIp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tigerskin displays mainly two colours‚Äîblack and orange, derived from pigments eumelanin and pheomelanin, respectively. The production of the orange colour is caused by the gene SLC45A2.   #InternationalTigerDay2020 #InternationalTigerDay #TigerDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tiger stripes are unique‚Äîlike human fingerprints  Tigerskin is extremely unique and was among the highly valued trade commodity in the 19th century due to the bold patterns of stripes on the animal‚Äôs body.  #InternationalTigerDay2020 #TigerDay  (üì∏: Madhusudan/TOI, Mysuru/BCCL)  https://t.co/eU4JFJtMmt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the occasion of #InternationalTigerDay, which is celebrated every year on July 29, The Weather Channel brings to you some of the most amazing facts about these big wild cats.  #InternationalTigerDay2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Sumatran tiger is said to be the smallest among these subspecies, weighing up to 310 pounds (140 kgs).  #InternationalTigerDay2020 #InternationalTigerDay #TigerDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #BengalTiger accounts for the highest numbers, forming 50% of the total tiger population worldwide. The Royal Bengal tiger weighs about 330 kgs, while the Siberian tiger is about 13 feet long and weighs 660 pounds, which is equivalent to roughly 300 kgs.   (üì∏:BCCL, Mysuru)  https://t.co/xLOK2IIXn4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Earlier, there existed about nine subspecies of tigers, but now, only six of them are present on Earth‚Äîthe Bengal tiger, South China tiger, Indochinese tiger, Sumatran tiger, and the Siberian tiger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But in recent decades, much of the wild tiger population rapidly declined due to hunting and habitat loss.  #InternationalTigerDay2020 #InternationalTigerDay #TigerDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These wild cats play an important role in balancing several ecosystems, and therefore, their conservation has always been of prime importance across the world. It is said in the 1900s, around 100,000 tigers roamed worldwide.   #InternationalTigerDay2020 #InternationalTigerDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tigers have dominated the wild ecosystems in India for hundreds of thousands of years. The earliest remains of tiger fossils date back to more than two million years ago. These beautiful beasts have evolved to swim.   #TigerDay  (üì∏:Ramoorthy P/TOI, Hyderabad, BCCL)  https://t.co/6XUMFSbdsl<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Moreover, nearly 43,78,732 people were affected due to the floods in 31 out of the country's total 64 districts. The inundation has reportedly caused widespread damage to habitation, crops, roads, and highways across vast swathes of the country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the other hand, the floods in the northern parts of #Bangladesh had killed at least 119 people by Monday, July 27. Of the victims, 96 people died of drowning, 13 of snakebites, eight of lightning, and one of diarrhoea.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If there is one thing to be learnt from the 2005 floods, it is that the most resilient city is the one that is always prepared to face the worst possible hazard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The technology of weather forecasting has improved substantially since 2005. However, despite all the super-computing abilities and enhanced knowledge, we still struggle to accurately predict such heavy rainfall episodes over a particular locality in time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mumbai does witness one or two spells of extremely heavy rainfall of over 200 mm every monsoon season. However, what transpired in 2005 was an unfortunate blend of unfavourable weather systems within a short time.  (üì∏: Deepak Salvi / Mumbai Mirror / BCCL)  https://t.co/AZDBYMVRQX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The resultant westerly winds brought in a lot of moisture from the Arabian sea and the local convergence led to the formation of thick clouds. The system was active for almost 6-8 hours, causing intense rainfall for a sustained period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Experts say the processes that led to the torrential downpour on July 26, 2005, are fairly common during every monsoon season.  A few days before July 26, 2005, a low-pressure area started to develop and it intensified into a well-marked low just before the D-day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This year alone, Assam, Meghalaya, Bihar, West Bengal and parts of Uttar Pradesh have witnessed devastating floods, while we are not even half-way through the monsoon season yet.  (üì∏: Pal Pillai/ MM, BCCL, MUMBAI)  https://t.co/3DFo3xswwB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The resultant floods killed over 1000 people, and the whole city came to a standstill.   Today, after one and a half decades later, the episode continues to remind the horrors of extreme weather events, as similar extremes threaten many parts of India.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fury of monsoon was so intense that the financial capital was slammed with more rains on a single day than what several parts of the country received in an entire year.   (üì∏: Palashranjan Bhaumik / TOI, BCCL, MUMBAI)  https://t.co/TMXvp6DBgJ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>With this methodology, researchers were able to derive the first evidence of coronae on Venus still actively evolving, which proves the planet‚Äôs interior remains alive and churning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But now, using numerical models of thermo-mechanic activity beneath the surface of Venus, researchers have created high-resolution, 3D simulations of coronae formation, which provide a more detailed view of the processes than ever before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Through the mantle layer and crust. Similar phenomena were responsible for the formation of the volcanic Hawaiian Islands on Earth as well.  https://t.co/QCUYh8fxAY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Venus has a much younger surface that appears to be hosting a warm interior with continued geologic activity.   The evidence for this is visible in the form of ring-like structures called coronae , which form when plumes of hot material rise from the underground.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Researchers say that these findings could have some major implications as the knowledge of Venus‚Äô most active geological locations could help identify where the geologic instruments should be placed for future Venus missions, such as Europe's EnVision or India's Shukrayaan-1.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A new study by researchers at the University of Maryland, US &amp; the Institute of Geophysics at Zurich, Switzerland, has found 37 volcanoes on the planet that are dormant. The evidence suggests that these volcanoes were active very recently and are now sleeping, but far from dead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least 1,000 volcanic structures populate Venus, with about 65% of its surface a mosaic of volcanic lava plains. But, none of these volcanoes have shown any signs of being active until now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The surface of Venus is covered by volcanic features; in fact, it has more volcanoes than any other planet in the Solar System.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And by the end of this year, the target will be to produce at least 300 million (30 crore) doses, Dr. Cyrus Poonawalla, Chairman of the Poonawalla Group (which includes the SII), told The Hindu.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Suresh Jadhav, Executive Director of the SII, revealed the company intends to create 2-3 million (20-30 lakh) doses of the vaccine by the end of August 2020.   #Covidshied #coronavirus #covid19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The early production has commenced in order to meet the commercial requirements for Phase 3 of the vaccine‚Äôs clinical trials.  #Covidshied #coronavirus #covid19<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>While much remains unknown, what we do know for certain is that @isro has successfully commenced work on #Chandrayaan3 back in November 2019. And while the #COVID19Pandemic may have affected developments, the mission remains likely to be launched by 2021.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The type of payloads (instruments) #Chandrayaan3 will carry remains unknown as of now. If it does retain all the main objectives of C2, it is likely to consist of payloads identical to those within Vikram Lander and Pragyan Rover that were destroyed during the hard landing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This would also make the mission more economical, with @isro chairman K. Sivan estimating it to be worth ‚Çπ615 crore rupees. In comparison, #Chandrayaan2 cost India ‚Çπ970 crore rupees‚Äîan extremely economic figure still, as far as space missions go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Considering the fact that the C2 Orbiter continues to function as expected, #Chandrayaan3 will only consist of a lander and a rover.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One such priority could be ‚Äústrengthening the legs of the lander‚Äù, so as to improve its chances of survival in the event of another crash.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moreover, reports suggest #ISRO scientists will also be considering incorporating improvements that experts have suggested after analysing what went wrong in the previous mission.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What will #Chandrayaan3 be like?  Based on the lessons learnt from Chandrayaan-2, the Chandrayaan-3 mission is expected to sport a configuration that allows robust design and capacity enhancement for mission flexibility, all while retaining the ‚Äòheritage‚Äô of its predecessor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meanwhile, in spite of the failure in the Lander aspect of the mission, @isro has remained intent on stepping foot on the Moon, and it aims to achieve the same by next year through the Chandrayaan-3 mission.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While the Lander shattered upon impact, the Chandrayaan-2 Orbiter, with its eight scientific instruments, remains operational, and will continue its seven-year mission to study the Earth‚Äôs natural satellite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While its initial descent was within mission parameters, the Lander's trajectory began to deviate as it edged closer to the surface, and it eventually crash-landed on the Moon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About 29 days after the launch, on August 20, 2019, the Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft entered the lunar orbit. Vikram Lander separated from the C2 Orbiter on September 2, and began its descent towards the southern lunar pole on September 6.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Subsequently, at 2:43 p.m. IST on July 22, the mission was successfully launched from the second launch pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Andhra Pradesh, on board the GSLV MK III M1 launch vehicle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Initially scheduled to launch on July 14, 2019, this mega-mission launch was aborted and rescheduled with just an hour to go due to a technical glitch.   @isro<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>While the maximum temperatures hovered at around 38¬∞C earlier last week, it dropped to 35¬∞C on Sunday. Further, on Monday morning, the capital witnessed a minimum temperature of 25.6¬∞C‚Äî two notches below normal for this time of the year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Delhi has experienced a rainfall deficit over the last month actual precipitation of 81.5 mm against the normal of 180.6 mm‚Äî a 55 per cent deficit from normal.  #DelhiRains #Monsoons #Monsoon2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The overall number of global COVID-19 cases was nearing 1.3 crores as of Monday morning, while the deaths have increased to more than 5.68 lakh according to the data compiled by the Johns Hopkins University.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even as per the WHO report, both the Russian vaccines from Gamaleya Research Institute are still under phase 1. As per the  https://t.co/vC1511mXpb database, phase 1 for these vaccines was estimated to be complete by August 15.  https://t.co/fdqKSd1voB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In some extreme cases, it may also take 10-12 years also‚Äîdepending on how better we understand the pathogen.  Since the number of volunteers involved in the study was less than 40, the success only means that it has cleared phase 1 of a total of 3 phases of clinical trials<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After vaccination, all volunteers were expected to remain in isolation in a hospital for 28 days.   On average, it takes a minimum of 10-12 months to make a vaccine available for the general public after it is developed in a lab.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚Ü™Ô∏èDid the vaccine conclude clinical trial or just phase 1?  The first stage of research on the vaccine at Sechenov University involved a group of 18 volunteers, and the second group comprised 20 volunteers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üíâEarlier, the results of the COVID-19 vaccine tests showed that volunteers were developing immunity to the coronavirus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"The research has been completed, and it proved that the vaccine is safe. The volunteers will be discharged on July 15 and July 20," Smolyarchuk was quoted as saying in the report. There was, no further information on what phase of the clinical trials has this vaccine completed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Overall, the population explosion remains an enormous concern, as it can impact the planet in myriad ways‚Äîfrom increasing pollution to deforestation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As per the UN, three main factors which influence the population growth include fertility rates, increasing longevity, and international migration.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The World Population Prospects 2019 has estimated China and India to be the most populated countries in the world. Currently, about 61% of the total global population lives in Asia (4.7 billion), followed by 17% in Africa (1.3 billion), and 10% in Europe (750 million).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As per the projection estimates from the UN, every year, nearly 83 million people are added to the rapidly growing worldwide population.

<|startoftext|>‚ö°Ô∏è ‚ÄúOver 97% CO2 Emissions in Himalayas Emerge From Space Heating in Households: Study‚Äù   https://t.co/cqZ3l6FZEw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If implemented well, the use of new technologies can supplement the pace in achieving the target of emissions intensity reduction of India's GDP by 33-35 percent from 2005 levels by 2030.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The report highlights the role of #MSMEs, innovators and start-ups in developing and mainstreaming sustainable technologies. It also identifies inadequate access to capital and skilled workforce, along with dense legislation and statutory compliance as barriers to this transition<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Limited financial capacities of households and lack of awareness have been identified as the primary barrier to a slower than required transition from traditional fuelwood based heating to more efficient and clean energy-based sustainable space heating technologies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The development and deployment of innovative solutions developed by #MSMEs thus have a tremendous potential to not only reduce the rising emissions but also decrease indoor air pollution and its associated health hazards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Currently, the emissions from space heating for the year 2020 stand at approximately 15.9 million (MT) of carbon dioxide, for the entire Himalayan region, equivalent to annual emissions generated from about 27 units of 200MW thermal power plants.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The study suggests that sustainable space heating systems can bring down carbon dioxide emissions by 30 percent in the Indian Himalayan region by 2030.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is in the light of this that the WWF India-TERI have released a report titled, 'Sustainable Space Heating Solutions in the Himalayan Region' that studies the impact of the adoption of new clean energy technologies on emissions in the region.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The traditional space heating mechanisms not only contribute to the increasing emissions of the region but also lead to the degradation of natural resources and adversely impact the health of people residing in these areas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Given its cold climatic conditions and unavailability of a regular source of power and limited financial capacity of local communities, people in the Indian Himalayan region often resort to fuelwood to provide thermal comfort in their built environment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Indian Himalayas are one of the most ecologically fragile regions in the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Out of this, almost 19 percent of overall emissions are from urban residential buildings and 78 percent are from rural residential buildings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Around three percent of overall emissions from space heating is attributed to commercial buildings, the remainder 97 percent is reported from the residential buildings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Over 78% of the total emissions in the Indian Himalayan region are from space heating in residential dwellings in rural areas, with 71.4 percent attributed to Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir, according to a recent report by the @WWF for Nature and @teriin.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The phenomenon was initially attributed to an error in image processing, but the researchers quickly realised the images were indeed properly aligned, and the flapping of the wings was real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The research team calculated that this planet warping the disk would orbit its star in no fewer than 180 days. They also estimate that this planet would be located at the same distance from its star as the Earth is from the Sun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pontoppidan and his team witnessed the ‚Äúflapping of the wings‚Äù over a span of 404 days. The ‚Äúflapping‚Äù visuals are most likely being caused by a planet embedded within the disc, whose gravity is pulling and warping the disk, he adds.  https://t.co/zb9WUia61A<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The shadow is ginormous‚Äîabout 200 times the length of our solar system. Therefore, the light takes about 40 to 45 days to travel from the star to the perceivable edge of the shadow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The entire casting-of-the-shadow phenomenon is similar to a lamp with a shade that casts a shadow on the wall‚Äîonly in this case, the lightbulb is the HBC 672 star, the lampshade is the disk, and the distant cloud is the wall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The shadow in question belongs to a saddle-shaped disk that surrounds a young star named HBC 672. It is only one or two million years old, which is young in cosmic terms, and resides in a stellar nursery called the Serpens Nebula, about 1,400 light-years away from the Earth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These striking scenes were created by a disk near an emerging star casting its shadow across a cloud within the star-forming region.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Research suggests that a warming world could mean the more thunderstorms, and the trends so far agree.  Experts say that most of the lightning deaths are avoidable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As per the data from the National Crime Record Bureau, an estimated 2500 people die due to lightning in India average every year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lightning is the deadliest natural calamity, killing more people than even the floods and cyclones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even in Uttar Pradesh, out of 24 deaths, nine victims were from in Deoria district alone.

<|startoftext|>According to reports, since 2003 there has been a drastic increase in the emissions from Arctic fires in the past two summers.   The emissions during June 2019 and June 2020, is said to be higher than combined emissions from all the June months from 2003-2018.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As per the Russian Forest Service, about 12 million acres of land was on fire in early June. Increase in wildfire activity significantly contributes to a rise in temperatures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moreover, the impact of rising temperatures can be clearly seen through the melting of Arctic sea ice. In September 2019, the volume of Arctic sea-ice after its melting season declined by more than 50% compared to the mean value for 1979‚Äì2019.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheArctic is regarded to be one of the fastest-warming regions worldwide and is said to be heating at twice the global average. As per the WMO data, the annual surface air temperatures over the last four years (2016‚Äì2019) in the Arctic region have been the highest on record.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reportedly, since the past few weeks, places around the arctic region have been witnessing an increase in the temperature levels, which was rarely seen earlier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As per WMO records, the previous such high temperature in the Verkhoyansk was recorded at 37.3¬∞C on July 25, 1988. Another town, Fort Yukon in Alaska recorded the first-ever 37.7¬∞C in 1915.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The temperature reached over 38¬∞C (100¬∞ F)‚Äîa whopping 18¬∞C more than normal mercury levels for this season.   #Trivia | The town used to be known for its extremely low temperatures, which drops to the level of -69.8¬∞C, making it one of the coldest places on the planet.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>As an active #earthquake zone, the #Philippines has frequent seismic activity due to its location along the Pacific "Ring of Fire". The Philippine archipelago has at least 24 active volcanoes.  #RingOfFire<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In January this year, #TaalVolcano in Batangas province, south of Manila, erupted, displacing thousands of residents in the province and nearby provinces.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On March 11, the institute raised the alert level over Mount Kanlaon.  Mount Kanlaon is the highest point in Negros Island, as well as the whole Visayas region, with an elevation of 2,465 metres above sea level.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moreover, the institute said the volcano emitted sulfur dioxide on June 13 and has observed ground deformation, indicating a slight deflation of the lower and mid slopes since January 2020.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It added that four of these earthquakes recorded between 1 a.m. to 2.06 a.m. on Monday were felt in La Carlota City and Bago City in Negros Occidental province and Canlaon City in Negros Oriental province.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Phivolcs said that it has recorded 136 volcano-tectonic earthquakes‚Äî#earthquakes caused by the movement of magma beneath the surface of the Earth‚Äîon the western flanks during the 24-hour observation period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"The local government units and the public are strongly reminded that entry into the 4-km radius permanent danger zone must be strictly prohibited due to the further possibilities of sudden and hazardous steam-driven or phreatic eruptions," the institute warned.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A team of forest officials and WWF led by Jain claimed that the fossil discovered by them is the first reported sample of an elephant in the region.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"The scientists at the Wadia Institute have now opined the age of this elephant fossil, ranging from 5 million to 8 million years," said Sanjay Kumar, who now readies to conduct another detailed study of the area.  https://t.co/Wt8PWJEAIH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The camera trap study, a powerful tool to investigate the presence of animals in a given area, was conducted with help of forest officials and experts of the World Wildlife Fund (@WWFINDIA) in Siwalik range.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The 33,000 hectares of reserve forests of Siwalik range in Saharanpur division, bordering the Rajaji National Park, was once inhabited by tigers. However, poaching and human interventions led to the disappearance of the large cats in the area.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The story, which led to the discovery of one of the oldest "habitat" of elephants, started when the government thought of finding a new reserve for the tigers in the Terai area.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The rare fossils of elephants suggest that the foothills of the Himalayas, the beautiful lush green Terai region in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, were once inhabited by giant elephants, giraffes, horses and hippopotamus.  https://t.co/BZVg7jBNjw<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Timing the arrival of the pulse to a detector on a spacecraft, and comparing that to when it is predicted to arrive at a reference point, provides information for navigating far beyond our planet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The stability of the pulses allows highly accurate predictions of their time of arrival to any reference point in the solar system.  Scientists have developed detailed models that predict precisely when a pulse would arrive at, for example, the centre of Earth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Software embedded in NICER, called the Station Explorer for X-ray Timing &amp; Navigation Technology or SEXTANT, is using the beacons from pulsars to create a GPS-like system.  Often referred to as XNAV, could provide autonomous navigation throughout the solar system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An X-ray telescope on the exterior of the space station, the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer or NICER, collects and timestamps the arrival of X-ray light from neutron stars across the sky.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From a great distance, they appear to pulse, hence the name pulsars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pulsars, or rapidly spinning neutron stars, are the extremely dense remains of stars that explode as supernovas.   They emit X-ray photons in bright, narrow beams that sweep the sky like a lighthouse as the stars spin.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>‚ö°Ô∏è ‚ÄúWhy is #June21 the Longest Day for Global North? Science Behind #SummerSolstice and Earth‚Äôs Changing Seasons‚Äù  #SummerSolstice2020   https://t.co/XzsnhVnIhz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The solstice takes place at the same time for everyone on Earth, marking the longest day for one hemisphere, and shortest for another.  #SummerSolstice #SummerSolstice2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In simpler words, when the summer solstice takes place in the Northern Hemisphere in June, the north pole is tilted towards the Sun, and the south pole away from it. This marks the beginning of different seasons in both the hemispheres.   #SummerSolstice #SummerSolstice2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This position changes in the time frame of six months, as the Sun moves towards the South pole. The Sun then goes directly overhead of the Tropic of Capricorn, whose latitude is 23.5¬∞S‚Äîmarking the winter solstice.  #SummerSolstice #SummerSolstice2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the summer solstice for the northern hemisphere, the Sun‚Äôs location is directly above the Tropic of Cancer. The north pole is tilted about 23.4¬∞ towards the Sun, which makes the rays fall directly overhead of the Tropic of Cancer, whose latitude is roughly the same 23¬∞ 3‚Äô N.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Solstice is a Latin word for ‚ÄòSuns stands still‚Äô. It‚Äôs called so as the Sun‚Äôs projection appears as if it is not moving‚Äîonce it reaches the highest position in the southern or northern part of the equator.  #SummerSolstice #SummerSolstice2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Therefore, the hemisphere which faces the Sun experiences summer, and the other half of Earth witnesses winter season.  #SummerSolstice #SummerSolstice2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Due to this axial tilt, only one part of the Earth‚Äîeither southern and northern hemisphere‚Äîfaces the Sun at any time of the year, while the other is farther away from it.   #SummerSolstice #SummerSolstice2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How does the summer solstice happen? The change of any season, equinoxes, or solstices completely depends on the Earth‚Äôs tilted axis of 23.5¬∞ with respect to the Sun. The axis of the Earth is an imaginary line that runs through the centre of the planet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every year, the summer solstice occurs between June 20 and 22.  #SummerSolstice #SummerSolstice2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Therefore, the summer solstice this year will be marked by a ‚Äòring of fire‚Äô. On this day, parts of the northern hemisphere will experience the longest period of sunlight. This official onset of this season is marked with long days, more sunlight, and shorter nights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It‚Äôs only the second time when these two astronomical events are occurring together since 1982.  #SummerSolstice #SummerSolstice2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Officially, the solstice is observed at around 3:13 am on June 21 in India. This year, it‚Äôs even more special for all astronomy enthusiasts, as the day will coincide with a rare annular solar eclipse.   #SummerSolstice #SummerSolstice2020  https://t.co/Bain2NmdyM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To clarify, June 21 is the longest day of the year in terms of more hours of sunlight‚Äîbut the number of hours (24) remains the same. For instance, in Delhi, the Sun will rise at 5.24 am on this day and set at around 7.23 pm‚Äîmarking nearly 14 hours of daylight.  #SummerSolstice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On this day, the Earth will be positioned in its orbit, where the North Pole is at its maximum tilt towards the Sun. The day marks the commencement of astronomical summer in the northern hemisphere.  #SummerSolstice #SummerSolstice2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, what makes June 21 special? The short answer is that, from this day onwards, the southern motion of the Sun, also referred to as the ‚ÄòDakshinayan‚Äô, begins.   #SummerSolstice #SummerSolstice2020  https://t.co/vefBDns3Qy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The sun will reach its highest position in the sky, and the shadows will disappear at noon if you are in Ujjain, Gandhi Nagar or essentially any place along the tropic of cancer on this day.  #SummerSolstice #SummerSolstice2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Northern Hemisphere, including India, will witness the longest daytime of the year on Sunday, June 21.   #SummerSolstice #SummerSolstice2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Though plasma therapy offers new light in the complex treatment of #COVID19 infections, availability of infrastructure, medical facilities, suitable donors, medicines and equipment pose a wide hindrance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚Ü™Ô∏èThe treatment can suppress the body‚Äôs natural immune system, thereby leading to chances of re-infection, though such cases have not been reported yet.  ‚Ü™Ô∏èThere are set criteria for a patient to be eligible for plasma therapy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚û°Ô∏èIs plasma therapy safe?‚¨ÖÔ∏è  ‚Ü™Ô∏èLike any other medical procedure, there are substantial risks involved in convalescent plasma therapy as well.  ‚Ü™Ô∏èDuring the process of blood transfusion, there are chances of inadvertent infections getting transferred to blood cells of the patient.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>-Several studies in multiple countries have reiterated the importance of ‚Äòpassive antibody therapy‚Äô as a success to treat #COVID19.   -Some researchers have expressed reservations against using the therapy, quoting some side effects like transfusion-transmitted infections.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚û°Ô∏èIs the therapy effective?‚¨ÖÔ∏è  -First #COVID19 patient who underwent #PlasmaTherapy in India recovered during last week of April in Delhi.

<|startoftext|>‚û°Ô∏èHas the therapy been used before?‚¨ÖÔ∏è  -Passive Antibody Therapy is an age-old technique to treat infectious diseases.  -German physiologist Emil von Behring and Japanese physician Baron Kitasato Shibasaburo are the pioneers of modern therapeutic Immunology.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the infected person can produce sufficient antibodies, he can recover from the disease caused by that pathogen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚û°Ô∏èWhat is convalescent plasma therapy?‚¨ÖÔ∏è  It is a passive antibody therapy where the immunity of a recovered patient is transferred to a sick person using blood plasma. When attacked by a pathogen, our immune system produces proteins called antibodies to fight the infection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Experts continue to stress that the therapy holds promise, and there is a growing need for plasma donors across the country to give a fighting chance for #COVID19 patients with severe symptoms.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation hailed the unique marvel of nature by putting up photos: "From Green to Pink: Lonar Crater Lake has changed its colour."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another unique aspect was in February when a couple of pink Flamingos made the Lonar Lake its home for a fortnight, gobbling on the lake algae.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Though in a remote location around 500 kms east of Mumbai, Lonar Lake now attracts around 400,000 tourists annually, besides scientists, from around the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Situated inside the small Lonar Sanctuary, it is renowned globally as the largest basaltic impact crater on the planet, created around 57,000 years ago, with 78-hectare lake's water unique on Earth for its dual salt and alkaline qualities.  https://t.co/SMbwLwNfBD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lonar Tehsildar Saipan Nadaf said local old-timers and records indicate a similar change in colour around 2000, but it did not grab much attention then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The sudden colour change - first noticed by Buldhana Tehsildar Saipan Nadaf - has come after over two decades when it had similarly changed its hue to reddish-pink.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Corals are at extreme risk of extinction due to the prevailing climate crisis, with nearly half of them already approaching a point of no-return over the past decades. In the absence of decisive action to reduce emissions, the fate of these ancient aquatic creatures looks grim.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The new technology is expected to make use of high-resolution satellite images and data analyses to help scientists determine the threats, and to enable governments to take appropriate action.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Countries are currently looking for ways to preserve this vast species from dying due to threats from the climate. Commonwealth Nations are on the run for gaining access to the modes of satellite technology to measure the health of corals.  üì∏: (NOAA)  https://t.co/97N5WFHFLP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that oceans are huge and water takes a longer time to heat up than air has eventually resulted in a warming of 0.11¬∞C per decade on an average, with maximum warming happening near the surface.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scientists say that the glowing colours in bleached coral reefs preserve them like a ‚Äòlayer‚Äô or a ‚Äòshield‚Äô, similar to how humans apply sunscreen. Corals‚Äîtiny, soft-bodied organisms that secrete calcium carbonate to build reefs‚Äîfeed themselves by two unique ways.   üì∏: (NOAA)  https://t.co/T9ly5IXeKj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The study, published in the open-access journal Current Biology, shows that this ‚Äòglowing‚Äô is used as a defence mechanism against warmer ocean temperatures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Recent research in the University of Southampton‚Äôs Coral Reef Laboratory has shown that the corals display a dazzling array of colour as they undergo bleaching‚Äîrapid discoloration of corals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As climate change threatens to collapse several ecosystems across the globe, these beautiful reefs are likely to be among the first to fall in a warming world.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In addition to Delhi, Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Northern parts of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, parts of Gujarat and Maharashtra (west coast), and Rajasthan all fall into seismic zone 4.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Delhi and its border towns, however, are witnessing consistent growth of the high rise private buildings, plenty of which do not adhere to mandatory guidelines of Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) set for earthquake-resistant construction, reports IANS.  #earthquakes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are a total of four seismic zones in India. According to the Bureau of India Standards, Delhi-NCR falls under seismic zone four, which states that parts of the region are prone to high damage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dr Kalachand Sain, Chief of Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, says that while we cannot predict the time, place, or the exact scale of these quakes, consistent seismic activity around the Delhi-NCR region could be a precursor to a major earthquake.  #earthquakes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And when the piled-up stress gets released, it produces minor frequency earthquakes in and around the National Capital Region.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Experts have stated that since the formation of the Himalayas, a large part of the crust under the mountain ranges has remained deformed. These rocks remain stressed and folded due to the continuous movement of the Indian plates under the mountain.<|endoftext|>
