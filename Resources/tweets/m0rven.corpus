<|startoftext|>@micablackers Just had a look on the website- there seem to be tickets for most shows available? Worth a look.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@micablackers Matt Lucas said on Sunday Brunch yesterday that they were looking at extending the run - maybe that’s for people who’ve lost seats or had to cancel? A glimmer of hope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DMTWestEnd Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DMTWestEnd hi - can you confirm if tickets have to be printed for the Les Mis concert, or is off a phone ok? I won’t have access to a printer between now and the 10th. Fingers crossed my tickets don’t get cancelled. Thanks!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bellamackie I worked in a hotel for a few summers and we made it with double cream, whisky and brown sugar. One guy had three bowls every morning. Not entirely sure how he survived his holiday... 🥃 🥣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bellamackie Your Scottish roots are shining through!! Extra salt if you’re really going full Scots Presbyterian. My granny didn’t even use milk. Just water, oats and salt. As such, not my favourite start to the day.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I miss the cinema.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@James1940 Loved Generation War. Shame about the Polish-English subtitling but you can get past it. Was on Nextflix. For any academics out there it’ll be available on BoB as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BENSTONELEY1 @James1940 It was on Netflix. Only gripe with it is some of the Polish-English subtitling is ropey at best!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lindamae @AuschwitzMuseum I read it in about a day because it was so light and badly written.

<|startoftext|>The best we can do is try to let ourselves feel it when it comes. And let it go when we can. The very worst part is that the minute you think you're past it, it starts all over again.  And always, every time, it takes your breath away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It won't hurt this much. Grief comes in its own time for everyone, in its own way. So the best we can do, the best anyone can do, is try for honesty. The really crappy thing, the very worst part of grief is that you can't control it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The thing we gotta try to remember is that it can turn on a dime. That's how you stay alive. When it hurts so much you can't breathe, that's how you survive. By remembering that one day, somehow, impossibly, you won't feel this way. It won't hurt this much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Grief may be a thing we all have in common, but it looks different on everyone. It isn't just death we have to grieve. It's life. It's loss. It's change. And when we wonder why it has to suck so much sometimes, has to hurt so bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear @RevRichardColes I know my version of grief, and can only offer empathy for yours. I hope you find something in the following. It’s from a great literary source (Grey’s Anatomy), but I have often sobbed myself through a reading of this. It will never go, but it will evolve.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ugh. Lost my @on_lothianbuses pass. It’s in a beautiful biscuit themed holder if it gets handed in... probably on a #11 bus. 😕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrAndrewCotter Playing with the dogs in the garden?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Dear @gilescoren and @sueperkins , there must be a decade you haven’t covered on the Supersizers...? Pure TV gold that needs revisited. It was such a joy. And that ‘tasche....  https://t.co/6sNTFVthv3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Filmhouse Excellent! And now purchased.... thanks. Have a good day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Filmhouse uh, is Saving Private Ryan sold out a month in advance? Keep getting this page when trying to buy tickets...  https://t.co/ikfJAto1Xf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am entirely over today. And it’s only 11am.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fancy trying #pastaevangelists for free?   https://t.co/dNwNIYS1ru  so good, yummy and quick. 😍 #discount #freepasta #vouchercode<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grahamhenry The ball bouncing though..... 😑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EastCoastBuses can I use my ridacard for two zones (city centre +b) and do a top up fare to get to Gullane? £2.70 each way if I’ve worked it out properly?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LEscargotSoho absolutely no availablity on July 1st for dinner? 😫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hello @CentralTaxisEd please don’t tell me my taxi is 2 minutes away when I’m still waiting 15 minutes later. #lateformeeting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanCalman Dunrobin... 4 miles from home. Miss it on days like today😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OliverBonas new store in Edinburgh looking good....when’s the grand opening?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClarenceHouse @RCT @thecastleofmey @OJBlack @ChrisHowie5 @KeerstB familiar part of the Royal estate...xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who knew there was someone out there who is grumpier than @MrAndrewCotter on #TheCut. But James Corrigan has done it. @iaincartergolf admirably in the middle.   (I would like to confirm I love Andrew Cotter. He’s Scottish and dour and that’s fine with me. #misunderstood)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScotRail so, 833 Edi-Inv cancelled. Replacement bus service never appears/breaks down. 936 service Perth. Now on the 1116 Gla-Inv service which with two carriages is standing room only and staff can’t seem to get on board as vestibule is full of passengers. Excellent service 👌🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScotRail Actually, it appears the replacement bus has broken down. How efficient.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScotRail Where is that?! Was told to come to market street and there is no one here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScotRail where is the bus replacement for 8:33 to Inverness leaving from? Little information provided and no staff to ask<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clairescott_<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Filmhouse hello! Is the 2:30 showing of girl open to all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrAndrewCotter &amp; @iaincartergolf uh, where’s my weekly dose of Mr Cotter’s dulcet tones and Iain’s Scottish roots? #whereisthecut #bereft<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScotRail @NetworkRailHML When I’ve paid £66 for a train ticket and then have to get a bus instead - am I entitled to compensation?! The bus would have been £15 on the same route....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@commissionersPC podcasts not available anymore? 😧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The @on_lothianbuses 36 route is such a joke. Every day it’s late or packed. I suspect tonight (if a bus ever shows up) it’ll be both.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’d forgotten just how much I love #NottingHill movie. Bernie was always my favourite(@hughbon) and that cheeky little cameo from @exitthelemming? ....be still my single heart.  #nottinghill20  #valentinesasasingle #benandjerrywerethereforme @emmafreud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh my god. These people are fucking idiots and they got us into this pissing mess in the first place. But obviously, the arsing dog comes first. Fuck freedom of movement. It’s the (blue) pet passports that need to be considered. Rar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Naeiwoc Also, it didn’t help. Fundamentally toasters are not the right shape for @Warburtons bread. Not deep enough = semi toasted loaf. The loaf needs to change. Or toasters need to be bigger. #toastproblems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Naeiwoc I am entirely normal. I enjoy they also wrote toast in the template - as did I. I’m a leading intellect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gearoidbrennan @captheatres One ticket available on the website for a matinee next week!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gearoidbrennan @captheatres I got one! Just out of my second viewing in 5 days. Amazing!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I understand why people are keeping hold of their Les Mis tickets but not a single return to be had?! Help me! @captheatres #addicted #24601<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I saw #LesMis at @captheatres on Saturday, now painfully stalking the ticket page for a return to see it again. So good. Cried from beginning to end, love it. ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmyKinLA Three identical strangers was long listed last year. Not eligible this year.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkyHelpTeam Yes - meet criteria, but only get option to increase to fibre max...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyHelpTeam hi I’m trying to change my account back to £18 unlimited@broadband but not getting the option online (even though it’s in the offer section??!)  https://t.co/RSGOA9ZKwn<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gearoidbrennan Mac shack. They prepared, deliveroo failed to deliver. @LaFavoritaEd saved us though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another ridiculous wait for @deliveroo in Edinburgh. What’s the point....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarianKeyes Listen to @thegriefcast Marian. You’ll find so many people feel exactly the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This popped into my email and my immediate thought was that the Times were throwing shade on @FlintstoneRocky @dadwroteaporno  https://t.co/DGjHrO3blT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gilescoren @sueperkins This needs to return to our screens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>£10 out of pocket because choosing “earlier train” on the @ScotRail website apparently means 24h earlier....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EdinUniStaff any update on when the uni is officially closed over Christmas? Still tbc on the semester dates?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Monday morning blues. No @dadwroteaporno to get me through my commute. #notpornoday 😑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@churchmoderator Back in the pulpit for one day only? Or just taking it all in?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have kept this weeks @thegriefcast for my flight to Vienna. Something about listening to them in the air makes them resonate more. It’s an odd feeling, but I’m going with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel that the Dame Em #footnotes could (and should) have been three hours long, not 24mins. Any chance of a directors cut? @dadwroteaporno<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jamie_murray I see you’re in Dornoch. I would say (bias) Brora Golf Club is better.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thegriefcast @JPicardie would be great.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HotelChocolat why have you taken away the glorious coffee &amp; cream selector?! My Saturday has been ruined by this disappointment. Caffe latte selector is a poor substitute. #lesigh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@churchmoderator Went to a humanist funeral recently. Found the whole thing cold and impersonal. Made me very thankful for a highland upbringing and you. Irrespective of the circumstances that gave me that insight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SofieHagen Fuck yes. I work at the uni and every bloody day hearing their shite singing nearly pushed me over the edge. Also no fucking self awareness- I do so love having to walk in the middle of a road to get past those fuckers. 🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uncleegor @dadwroteaporno  https://t.co/WvXE6mN3qQ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I loved #austentatious so much yesterday I’m off to #crosstentatious tonight. What jubilations and japes await...? @AustenImpro<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KermodeMovie War please!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaydeadams you were amazing tonight. A very upbeat end to my shitty day! x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for the #11 diversion @on_lothianbuses the delays this week have been horrific, so this has really helped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A sad state of affairs when you have to go to Starbucks to save money rather than @uoecafes during the fringe because the university hike their prices.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hello @Filmhouse your emails about showings are still an absolute nightmare to read! Any chance of a fix?  https://t.co/tUTtIYBtgo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@beckygarrod @thegriefcast Thank you. I always feel we get a bit lost in the pecking order when it comes to grief. Hope you’re doing ok. ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Analogue grief is so shit at times in this digital world. Thanks to the @thegriefcast for making me feel a little less lost in this digital world. 19 years tonight since my sister walked out the door and never came back. NINETEEN.

<|startoftext|>Congrats @ladycariad for the awards for @thegriefcast. So deserved. Your podcast maintains my sanity. 😘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big day tomorrow @VicarofDornoch! Hope you sleep.... look forward to watching you do your thing from the cheap seats. xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thegriefcast Yes, we have about 10 wks left. Just don’t feel done...we were just getting to the hard stuff (the joys of avoiding for 17years!) Not really in the headspace to start over with a new person. The podcast does help me so much, Tom last week was unexpectedly on point for me. Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thegriefcast so, my therapist of 3 1/2 years (who is the only person I have ever talked to about sisters death when I was a teenager) is leaving practice. Is it weird that I’m now feeling grief towards losing him? That combined with the utter terror of going it alone...😬<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dadwroteaporno just a FYI bothy rhymes with frothy. Also there is a LYC airport (Sweden) but I’m sure Rocky didn’t fact check that. Other than that, Belinda’s Christmas was amazing. Although sticky. 😘#belindablinked #pornoday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayrayner1 This prompted a text to my mother to demand there be jelly in my house when I return for Christmas . (I’m 33.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJMardy @thegriefcast My sister died 18 years ago - when I was 14 - and last Christmas was a total no go for me. Ebbs and flows.

<|startoftext|>@PJMardy @thegriefcast I remind myself it’s ok that I’ve not sent cards, or bought elaborate gifts - because I don’t have the energy or festive “cheer”. Social norms be damned.

<|startoftext|>@lostmysibling you should listen to @thegriefcast - especially Jayde Adams episode about the death of her sister. Really helps me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks @CineworldEdin for giving me an old #poundcoin in my change at noon and then refusing it as legal three hours later.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@on_lothianbuses Yep - both ways at peak rush hours. Have been left at canonmills at 530pm as bus is full.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@on_lothianbuses I do (I get on at bonnington) but being packed in like sardines by canonmills is horrific.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The worst way to start anyone’s day is getting on the @on_lothianbuses 36 heading for the Gyle. #standingroomonly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is @GNSCast officially dead? Disappeared from my iTunes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joelycett @guardian The largest problem is being friends with people who serve you echo falls. (The baby nonsense is a given horror)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oti &amp; Jonnie for the win! #Strictly2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dadwroteaporno I caved. Listened already. Game. Changer. #bravorocky #pornoday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Parents, kids walking through Edinburgh with John Lewis duvet and pillows under their arms. A new academic year begins...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I probably wasn't allowed to take a photo of @sueperkins during her show, but I did it anyway. Such a rebel. #spectacles #edfringe #ilovesue  https://t.co/qAwT0kDttL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HistoryHit is there going to be part 4 of  the passchendaele podcasts?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jordandias Coles and Calman... that's enough for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wanted to speak to @jaydeadams on the Edinburgh streets today. Got scared, and didn't. #tooscottish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acast @thegriefcast Oh yeah. I'm an arse. Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acast @thegriefcast No updates since July 10..... 😕  https://t.co/HJKdSnLnM9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thegriefcast @jondharvey Any reason I can't find this on iTunes? 😘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is nothing more soul destroying than waiting for #windows10 updates. FOUR FUCKING HOURS AND STILL NOT FINISHED.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edbookfest Thanks for clarifying!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edbookfest will returns be available online or in person only? Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@on_lothianbuses Number 36 (I get on at Gibson st 8:17/8:27) are usually full/close to full when they arrive M-F. Weekends/non peak are fine. Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hello @on_lothianbuses. Every day the 36 is packed with people standing most of their journey. Chances a bigger bus could be used in peak?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you get kicked off @realDonaldTrump's cabinet, move to Edinburgh, Scotland and set up a coffee stall for the festival. @WestWingWeekly  https://t.co/4UrlzGH8K7<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Filmhouse Excellent! Bonus daughter points ahead! Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Filmhouse what are the chances of a subtitled showing of Dunkirk between 14/17 august? My mum is visiting and really wants to see it...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edinsketcher glad to report that the blue lithograph was a hit with the recipients. Wedding presents are stressful! @OJBlack &amp; @ChrisHowie5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I cannot go through another Isner v Mahut situation. Someone win this. PLEASE. #wimbledon #nadal #muller @bbctennis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How does @PseudoFed feel about the @bbctennis showing Rafa's game while Fed is on the red button....? 🔴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thegriefcast nice to hear I'm not the only person who googles my dead sister, even though she doesn't exist on the internet. #analoguegrief<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely drives me nuts the way #Konta bounces a ball. #wimbledon17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Song to Song. Biggest pile of pretentious wank I've seen in a long time. (Gosling and Portman were the only redeeming features.) #eiff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jk_rowling why is Tonks called Tonks?  Am I right in thinking Edinburgh academic connection?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Utterly failed at life. Forgot @edbookfest tickets went on sale yesterday. So no @JudyMurray and no @joelycett for me. I never forget this!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JudyMurray You on this list @grahamhenry? Or was this after Andy beat you? 😘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes I took a sneaky pic of Sadiq Khan at work yesterday. It felt important.  https://t.co/rKU2Z9McbU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dimbleby passing over to Edwards. The natural and reassuring order of British programming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love that my county has gone back to its political roots. (And thank fuck Salmond is gone.)  https://t.co/vntjgnyVYi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Leaving my job this week, and I thought there was only one way to round off my time in the workplace.... @WestWingWeekly  https://t.co/IgNc8aleOp<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>As someone with a politics degree I feel pretty ashamed to admit at this stage I am done with the news and politics 'til Friday. #saturated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SirSandGoblin Thanks! I look forward to many a pompom update on Thursday evening. Bonne chance!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SirSandGoblin are the pom-poms being stitched down? Glued down? I need this level of detail. #PomPomElection<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GNSCast are you guys coming back?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interviewing people who have just heard a family member is probably dead is fucking shameful @BBCNews we don't need that level of intrusion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thegriefcast In response to dead sister "I'm sorry" "why are you sorry? Did you kill her?!" I might need to work on that response a bit more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump All we Brits need is tea, common sense and to bash on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just paid 45p for a single Milky Way. #brokenbritain #snpscotland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jordandias No one expects the Spanish Inquisition..... (I adore sliding doors).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@edinsketcher @scotdesignex If I could reserve it that would be great - hopefully get to OT on Friday - defo Saturday. Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thegriefcast I have listened to @jaydeadams episode so many times. It helps me feel a bit more sane - 18 years after my sister died.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edinsketcher @scotdesignex Hmmm, how big is this one? Can't get to OT until the weekend....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fairly sure I just walked past @jupitusphillip on the mean streets of Edinburgh. Brightened up an otherwise crappy day. #failte<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tickets bought for @joelycett and friends @edfringe. All for the charity..... #gooddeed #goodtimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The one day of the year in Scotland where having long hair is a problem. Sweaty. Ugh.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ianwaite @RealNatalieLowe @WyvernTheatre A girl can never have enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emmafreud It's not a proper party without a Vienetta.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reliving the joy of @dadwroteaporno in preparation for the new episodes next month. Still ridiculous. Still a joy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @amazon do you want to stop installing apps on my fire so it will have some storage left so I can actually use it?! Infuriating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lamb and McRae are spectacularly dazzling. #rubies #ROHjewels<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ScotRail what's the situation with wick/Inverness 8.02 replacement. My mum is waiting on a platform in brora - no sign of bus?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally the BBC have updated @grahnort podcast picture to reflect the beard. I'm enjoying it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hacked into parentals Sky for a bit of #AusOpen this morning. Might snooze until 8 though. Time difference not appreciated on a Saturday am.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Holyrood9A @Deliveroo_EDI sadly not to my postcode....I'm not even 400 yards from leith walk. Radius on deliveries is tiny on deliveroo 😕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@estherwalker I did similar with a pair of joules finest. And a proper winter jacket. God will mock my grown up responsible side with sun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RufusHound can be argued that "free" education isn't all that. Yes, my degree was free, but It didn't need to be.  https://t.co/ZGraJftuEx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OliverBonas is the Albert desk gone forever or is it just temporarily out of stock? Please say it's not gone forever... =)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OliverBonas hello! Is the Albert desk going to be back in stock or is it gone forever....? Please say it's just a temporary vanishing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@judmoo I had that last night. So bloody good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthaig1was going to ask you if you were "over it" tonight, but seemed a bit abrupt. And difficult to phrase properly. Much like a tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StagecoachNScot will the X99 at 2020 wait for the 430 bus from Edinburgh as a connecting service? (Today)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StagecoachNScot need to get home for a funeral on Sat'day morning and this is the only option of transport. (Sorry, this is a bit of a beg)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StagecoachNScot any chance I can ask the 20:20 x99 from Inverness on Friday to wait for me if the 1630 from Edinburgh is running late?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @joelycett your show last night was bloody amazeballs. Toot your own trumpet in honour of my hard earned praise. It's rare. 🎺❤️😐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeerstB what chance of our paths crossing for festival fun 2015? x<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@estherwalker please don't leave. I don't have kids (nothing coming out of my foof ever) but you make me feel sane for not liking kids. x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has @andy_murray cut his hair since his wedding? It's a bit whinbushy. Sort him out @judmoo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear therapist. Remove your office from the same street as hotel chocolat. It's costing me a bloody fortune. Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gilescoren fuck yes! Bring some sanity to the SNP infested HP. And I'm Scottish....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Listening to @LozzaFox to get me through my horrid work day. So far, 11am and I haven't killed anyone. Loz clearly a calming  force #result<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today @KeerstB - the people I work with are entirely the fuckers ruining my day. What joy. I would like to request my migraine returns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some people will always be fucking wankers. Not going to change.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Another stupid idea.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@grahamhenry did/have Highland announced yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grantwoolner @OJBlack @ChrisHowie5 45/55. As I predicted. Happy days. 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChrisHowie5 yeah, I'm liking these results so far. Also, I need to sleeeeeeeeep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grahamhenry HAPPY. (Also, tired - I should sleep)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OJBlack @ChrisHowie5 @grantwoolner first declaration 54/46. Hope it continues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grahamhenry bbc just had shots from dundee count - a lot of votes going onto the NO piles... Now evacuated for fire alarm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jordandias yes, bird. Not my favourite. They do have Charlie Jeffrey though. If only Bomberg had an interest in Scottish politics...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jordandias I only get BBC Scotland. I hope this is not the future...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grahamhenry get yer face on the TV. xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisHowie5 @grantwoolner I hope (with every fibre of my being) 55/45. Can't deal with anything closer. Stressful shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grahamhenry I feel sick at the thought of the result.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bakingjames ooh, a clynelish lover? Excellent. Made in my home village. Love when people know about it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grahamhenry "an old uni friend". What an honour! 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First day back and I feel totally deflated. Nice that colleagues help you out when you're away - oh, that's right, they didn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeathrowAirport Just lost $30 of maple syrup I bought in Toronto dutyfree to LHR security as Canadians didn't put it in a bag. Angry.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KeerstB yeah, no plans at this end! Other than procrastinating on the packing job....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeerstB possibly? Leave Tuesday 10th.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeerstB thanks for the support....😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really need to start thinking about packing. I hate packing. Can I hire someone to do it for me?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OJBlack glad it arrived. Yes, 1 week 4 days to holidays, very excited (almost unbearable!). Good birthday? xxx<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just putting this out there - I hate selfies. Whether make up free or not. The word annoys me, the act annoys me. Selfies are SHIT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is @PseudoFed actually @rogerfederer playing some evil mind games. Both seem to tweet within seconds of each other. #GOAT<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KeerstB yeah - family friends bought me dinner would be rude to refuse a glass of wine when they've bought a bottle...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeerstB oh, I know, but I had a drink so presumed I was seeing things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I must be hallucinating. I saw a tram. In edinburgh. An actual moving (both directions) tram.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well played Dave. #gutinstinct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jordandias being skip is horrifically pressured. Everyone plays badly in team at somepoint. More noticeable when skip is last to play.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Havha, bogey coming out of Hazel Irvine's nose. Classy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OJBlack and you're not?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That felt awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stockard Channing is 70?! Somehow, that baffles me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turns out my curling slide is still pretty good... Shame I demonstrated it in front of a packed bus. #earlymorningissues #doh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Definitely too early in the morning to endure Hazel Irvine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeerstB I've looked into curling options. Will let you know if anything comes of it and you can join me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCSport looking forward to returning to a curling rink after 6 years away. Team GB have inspired me to get my curl back on! #lovecurling<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jordandias true. The Dimbleby's are the only people allowed to commentate on the BBC. I'm sure that's written down somewhere.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@claireEscott1 birthday carrot cake for a certain 40 year old....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Home to bake. I am baking through the horrific pain that is my job. Says it all really.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously. So excited at the thought of Olympics. Yes, Russian policy on most things is bullshit, but, OLYMPICS. With curling....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so excited about the Winter Olympics. I know it's not the same as London 2012, but it's still awesome. #geek<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Real life problems. Mr Selfridge. The Musketeers. Both on from next Sunday. Both on a 9pm. fml.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KeerstB or was it Arafat who died?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeerstB a lot of money on a university politics degree was clearly money well spent. Seriously, 100 million percent thought he was dead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it ok that I really thought Ariel Sharon had died, so the BBC report that his health is deteriorating has totally confused me?! @KeerstB<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Harry Potter 7 (pt 1). I do not care that the worlds biggest festival is happening on my doorstep. I'm staying in my house.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Happy Birthday @grahamhenry! My argument for being so late in the day is the fact you used to change your bday date in my diary. xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do I have to go to work? Yesterday wasn't fun, I don't want to have to do it again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grahamhenry no. I don't like the bathroom. The marble is tacky. Get me a better bathroom and I'll consider it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grahamhenry a drop in the ocean for you Mr Henry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamhillscomedy how are you doing a show on wednesday in edinburgh at 730 and @TheLastLeg at 10 in LDN?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The stupid thing is, people taking part in #twittersilence feel the need to come onto twitter to say they're not going to be on twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmm. Should I have watched Mad Men by this point in my life? Never felt the need before. Maybe it's time.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@grantwoolner oh, this monstrosity had to be shared. It's like civic duty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fake hair as your hair bobble? Very weird. Very weird indeed.  http://t.co/I05Kf38C<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reasons why I need a new job #143. In the office on a Sunday. Boooooooo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHRISDJMOYLES have you seen the picture the BBC are using for your live stream? SUE them!  http://t.co/7NzJWmzt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is anything that's advertised this year NOT an official product of Team GB. Everything, everything seems to claim to be. #Olympics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When rice is as hard as bullets, it's not ready. Just a bit of advice for you canteen "chefs".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ahj @davidvitty @CHRISDJMOYLES will alternative commentary be available after game? I'm out tonight so won't see it live...😖<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eteaket my favourite!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidvitty unshaven, sleeping, baldy. #dontcallmebaldy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@manytypesoftea I've been searching for him all night....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going on a pub hunt in the hope of finding @TinaDaheley @CHRISDJMOYLES @ahj @domisatwit @davidvitty. Any clues as to whereabouts?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>View on castle esplanade #edinburgh #Olympics #olympictorchscotland  http://t.co/WeayTUbD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHRISDJMOYLES the sun is shining. And deep fried pizzas and mars bars await you! Yey!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pipskin @ahj @freyalast I mostly worry for @TinaDaheley who seems to be alone on the train. #poortina<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@domisatwit 3 to chose from in edinburgh. Scotland has special nandos loyalty cards. Theyre plastic and only valid here! #exclusivechicken<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ahj why do the team all travel seperately? Do you secretly hate each other...? Say it isn't so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@domisatwit @davidvitty the sun is shining in edinburgh and the mars bars &amp; pizzas are ready for deep frying! See you soon!  #R1olympictour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrismoylesshow here's edinburgh, and its Olympic rings at 8:12 this morning.#edinburgh #olympics #torch  http://t.co/VuVAiszY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I avoided Oliver! when I thought @SamanthaBarks wasn't starring. But if she's back from #lesmis then I will absolutely be there. #edinburgh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shouldn't have watched #lesmis last night. Alfie Bo was amazing, but songs very much stuck in my head today... #idreamedadream<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clarebalding1 wrong James. He's @JKCorden...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OJBlack uh, WHAT? If I didn't love you I would seriously hate you right now. xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grantwoolner I think whoever advised Paul that Live and Let Die was a good choice should be shot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grantwoolner so not watch the patriotic fireworks. You may actually die.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grantwoolner you're lucky. BBC cut her from the highlights. Your ears will not be damaged by her out of tune shrill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grantwoolner uh, yes. Wasnt going to admit to crying for Sing. My particular low point was Cheryl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grantwoolner I got super teary as the fireworks went off. Amazeballs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fun day at @britanniayacht for #jubilee. Amazing place.  http://t.co/d0dy5LXL<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Some colleagues really are yawn inducing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ICHazUrFinances it's an oralb electric one. Changed to "flossing" brush which apparently is a vicious little shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oooh off to see #Brave close the @edfilmfest! Super exciting. Maybe a glimpse of @TheRealKMcKidd if we're lucky @irene_adler... =)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My new toothbrush is so powerful it seems to have skinned my gums. My teeth themselves - never been cleaner. Excuse the blood though. =(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gilescoren yes there is. It's brief, but beautiful sentiment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ICHazUrFinances 1st 3-4 times burns like the devil. Then - magically - it doesn't. Minty fresh though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DualVitality @estherwalker I object! Closer was awesome. Think it won a bafta or two as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OJBlack is everything ok? xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@h_napoli I never noticed your mouth was so massive miss holly! Oh wait a minute, I totally knew that 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomKitchin @h_napoli Oooh! Happy Birthday Hollybelles! xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking forward to my £70million win tonight. Means I can live the life I was born for... A lady, surplus to requirements #shame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@d_rossmartin Can you please sort him (@grahamhenry) out? Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grahamhenry I think you need to speak to my friend and yours, Mr Martin, for some "education". #nonobloodyno<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@grahamhenry oh please. We ALL swallow chewing gum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AledBlake @grahamhenry don't say mug to him. The mocking will never end....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OJBlack yep. Would have been fab without it though. It's pretty dark, the things you miss age 7.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First film I ever saw at cinema - Beauty &amp; The Beast. Saw it again today, 19 years later. Still awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy Birthday to one of my favourite people, Mr @OJBlack xxx<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BrewLabCoffee please can I join the hot chocolate drinking....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ICHazUrFinances get a Blu ray.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ICHazUrFinances I used to do that too - mostly while I was in the black period at SAAS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrjakehumphrey is EJ wearing highheels?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh my god. Made in Chelsea is horrific.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrewLabCoffee what are you stocking for tea choices? @eteaket is always a winner for quality and something a bit different?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrewLabCoffee I live near Holyrood- not too far! Drink of choice changes constantly, but a cafe should always be judged on its cappuccinos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrewLabCoffee Hi! Your venture sounds great - love the furniture. Look forward to coffee when you guys open. Good luck with everything!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eh1com I've started a blog on tea and coffee in edinburgh, please have a read (&amp; ignore the fact last post was London)  http://t.co/lZzbtziz<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gilescoren @estherwalker oh, you two are adorable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grahamhenry @juliamcwatt absolutely.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I shouldn't take time off work. Returned to a pile of cases on my desk, and a lot of grumpy emails/voicemails. #sigh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>nice to see @VicReeves1 using an east coast train. I felt like I was living in an advert. 😃<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ICHazUrFinances no probs. send it whenever, my recruitment peeps are not the fastest themselves!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OJBlack hope interviews went ok! I will blacklist my twitter should I ever apply for new job. Alternatively I could just stop swearing...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@grantwoolner it's distinctive. Like penmanship. I'm sure he loves writing it with a quill, encompassing both distinctive name and ink.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Off to @Filmhouse tonight to watch shame. All about The Fassbender.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Today in unemployment land... I watched the full first season of @DowntonAbbey and baked a batch of soft pretzels. I'm so middle class.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Catching up on @DowntonAbbey 1 in preparation for 2 on Sunday. Oooh, O'Brien really is a stirrer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@will_young31 you can tweet him directly @robertbillingto to share your pain.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Shouting at the tv. Great stuff. #theopen #bbcgolf<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I wish the BBC commentators would stop trying to use a Spanish accent on Jimenez's name. Really annoying. And to be frank, slightly awkward<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OJBlack I feel slightly violated.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OJBlack yes, beautiful. But the caterpillar kind of ruined it. Totally out of keeping with an event that put April 30th to shame!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ianwaite model? Topless obviously...=)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another dream about @OJBlack getting hitched. The cake was a chocolate caterpillar, so I easily knew it was just a dream... #weirdbrain<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>“@Caggie_Dunlop: Just clocked, therapist with a space= the-rapist. Coincidence? I think not.” Concerning. More so that mine is gay...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@qikipedia I've been whacked on the head by that very thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Edinburgh sunburn. #whoknew<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What joy. A haircut, bit of retail therapy and bumped into @grahamhenry at OT. #loveedinburghsaturdays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the presence of a genuine 1980's mullet. Quite disturbed tbh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grahamhenry why why why are you coming to visit?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Forgot to put my contacts in, no glasses in my handbag. #epicfail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is it JULY already?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grahamhenry I am wasting my life and my talent working for SAAS. And currently watching a guy fondle a walrus penis bone on C4.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grahamhenry I drink Duchy Originals Organic tea in the hope it has a similar effect. Apparently, it just makes me annoying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Beathhigh or a yumyum?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reading Miss @VictoriaCoren 's brilliant FRFP on the way to work. Proper book version, not crappy kindle. I urge you to pick up a copy. =)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The pain is creeping back. Root canal sucks (coupled with not enough drugs in my house). Never again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nazgulord I've never understood Nadal's appeal. So it's sour grapes from me I suspect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is Federer a) not on centre court and b) not on BBC main coverage? Red button is totally unacceptable. #bbctennis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How depressing. Daniel Craig is a married man. Oh well, must restart stalking Clooney again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lisakelllly Hello pouffcake! xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@domisatwit must be exploding right about now - or crying. Maybe both. #u2 #Glastonbury<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wonder if @gilescoren made it into the royal box at #Wimbledon with rupert grint, or was it the cheap seats for him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm willing Andy Murray to win, but have suddenly remembered I'm a Roger Federer fan. Oops. #Wimbledon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Murray is Scottish. Positive is not even in his dictionary. I can say that, being Scottish as well. Doom & gloom rules. #bbctennis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grahamhenry are you weeping for Ms Sharapova, or expecting a Russian comeback? xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gilescoren beyond jealous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Roger = ♥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OJBlack you could FaceTime it to me if you want?! x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting emotional watching #Wimbledon documentary. Tears over tennis? I should be more ashamed than I am...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OJBlack is it childish that the book beside it amuses me more (back passage obvs) x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As @CJCreggConcanon once said, I've had woot cawal. Ouch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gilescoren 's letter to Kitty in this months MC is beautiful. Off to write letters to my parents to thank them for keeping me for 27 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At the end of a bad interview, there should always be a great cocktail. #edinburgh #sygn #espresso #cocktail  http://instagr.am/p/F0sX5/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OJBlack just come out of a 3 hour interview for a media monitoring job for re government. It was awful. xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Job interviews are horrific.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vancouver pictures make me sad. #itsonlyagame<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@grahamhenry puffins are the manic depressives of the bird world. So cheery by colour, but look sad when you notice their expression.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. 2 hours of rain, 6 pit stops. Immense win. #F1 #button<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, benetint. Where have you been my whole life?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Dear therapist, 7pm is a wholly unacceptable time to offer me for an appointment. Especially since I'm free from 4pm. #epicfail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irene_adler what difference does it make? He's still ugly....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@estherwalker has giles taken over your twitter again?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>love this... “@Beathhigh: @gilescoren With all this gossip flying around I'm surprised you haven't taken out a sueperkinsjunction...”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear @gilescoren I will smuggle everything into jail for you. And gladly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#superinjunctions are all well and good, but when everyone knows who it is why does it fucking matter?! This is the price of fame. End of.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Oh Downton Abbey. Can I come and stay?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love Country House Rescue. Posh people with no money actively avoid making money while being shouted at by an equally posh woman. Classic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear dear dear @VictoriaCoren. I read your Royal Wedding article and agreed with absolutely every word. And I never agree with anyone, ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OJBlack yep! No Xmas but space, treasure island, original movie, take manhattan, muppet caper, lots of muppet documentaries too! Love it! x<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>East Coast rail. You suck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Train possibly delayed by 3 hours. Really?! Really?! I bet the protesters have something to do with this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@colinjustin should be on 4OD online/virgin although not everything is available on the site.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@grahamhenry no he's not. He's a long haired wimp. He's scared of getting beaten by RFed. End of.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Grahamhenry where have you been for the last 100 years of my life?! Thanks for my birthday love. Much appreciated ♥♥♥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbcstrictly I would like it known that I ♥ @craigrevhorwood after he sent me a birthday tweet. Ah-may-zing darling... =)<|endoftext|>
