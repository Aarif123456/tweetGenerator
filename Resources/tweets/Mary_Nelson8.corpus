<|startoftext|>What just cracks me up about this:  Trump has created his own reality and convinced his supporters to enter Trump Fantasyland with him.  And now they think they can just pretend to vote as "electors" and submit their pretend paperwork.  So cute. ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>REALLY hate electoral maps.  Geography does not vote. These maps distort actual support for candidates, since they are not based on population. We need to stop displaying information in such misleading ways.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Why Scalise's "Let‚Äôs let this legal process play itself out" should have even more vigorously challenged by Wallace on Fox today:  Trump's failing lawsuits proved repeatedly that his claims of fraud are themselves fraudulent.

<|startoftext|>Infuriating.  Helping / protecting the wealthy + political donors has been @senatemajldr's focus (when he's not packing the courts w/unqualified judges).  Say NO to shielding companies from liability if they do not protect workers.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I also don't believe the narrative that #Republicans are scared.

<|startoftext|>What it means: "...#Republican leaders now stand for a new notion: that the final decisions of voters can be challenged without a basis in fact if the results are not to the liking of the losing side."

<|startoftext|>Sen. Murphy is right.  The #GOP lawsuit request of #SCOTUS was treacherous, even seditious, b/c it did not respect the fundamental idea of democracy--that VOTERS choose who leads the nation.  We don't overturn an election b/c the loser doesn't like the result. #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Republicans wanted the Supreme Court, not voters, to decide an election, after their candidate lost by 7 million votes.  [Note: All claims of fraud had no evidence.

<|startoftext|>Republicans abandoned their principles.

<|startoftext|>If anyone should get credit for the #COVID19 vaccines, it should be people like Dr. Kariko who have studied and worked their entire careers to have the expertise and experience to develop something like this in record time.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Bullying at its finest.  Want to undermine confidence in a vaccine? Force scientists to approve it, whether they find it effective or not.  These people do not deserve the power they have. Jan. 20 cannot come soon enough.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And people are dying every single day b/c Trump + his party -refuse common-sense measures that save lives, like wearing masks -refuse to coordinate responses among the states -spread irresponsible propaganda ab. the virus -make responding to the crisis a political issue #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump DOES deserve credit for America's #COVID19 #pandemic. We can credit him w/hundreds of thousands of deaths b/c he never addressed the pandemic's issues with serious, broad-based, national policies &amp; programs. Trump just gave up. Unforgiveable malfeasance. #TrumpFailedAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump just likes to be praised...and have his over-inflated self-image validated.  But he deserves no credit at all for any #COVID19Vaccine. He did nothing to create them.   https://t.co/Ymxb4PIeO0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scientists brought their knowledge, expertise, and vast experience to the development of these #vaccines and then worked around the clock to make their development faster than usual.

<|startoftext|>Trump's complaints ab. #Election2020results are like a child who resents the fact that his brother won a contest they both entered: -Claiming the contest was 'rigged' -Attacking the refs -Whining ab. rules -Asking friends to agree  That's Trump's emotional state. He's acting out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. And it's disturbing that Republicans are willing to cheat, publicly, and use the levers of power to undermine (even destroy) #democracy.  People must remain vigilant ab. efforts to suppress the vote in their local communities. Or we may lose our democratic republic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While a tweet thread cannot do justice to the damage Reagan / #Republicans did to the US in the 80s (and was thereby practically sainted by his party, simply due to PR not actual achievements and definitely ignoring criminality), this thread is a start.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@VABVOX Agree. Those who have been harmed must hear that the abuser is sincerely remorseful. True of political harm too.  Reconciliation must always include remorse and reckoning.

<|startoftext|>Unreal that they could betray our democratic republic by trying to nullify our votes.  They are betraying the country's most cherished ideals. If it was my state, I'd be contacting my governor, state senator, state legislator, and the AG's offices to express my disdain. #election<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In 2016 bookies also predicted that Hillary Clinton would win--by a lot! And yet she did not insist that the outcome   be "overturned".  Trump makes assertions of election fraud based on ridiculous notions that he would not have accepted after an election he won.   #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This statement must be read by voters, some of whom believe that the will of other voters should be ignored by the courts, so that literally a small group of Trump allies can decide who won.  Not happening. #Election2020results<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Again Trump is demanding that the will of voters be overturned, just b/c he is sad that he lost.  All states have certified their elections.  Trump has lost all his legal battles in court. The people have spoken.  There is absolutely no reason to "overturn".  #Election2020results  https://t.co/ktyqVUz1L6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One more thing: Hospital beds and ICU care are becoming less available due to high demand.  Even if you have privilege, there may be no hospital care available when needed--and it could become a situation in which care is rationed. #WearAMask #StayAtHome   https://t.co/LMTJNoTbQX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Giuliani is receiving therapies available to very few Americans. His privilege, in access to the rarest and most expensive treatments and healthcare, allows him to promote conduct that most of us cannot choose.  #WearAMask #StayAtHome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thinking that almost all #Republicans will be labeled as enemies of #democracy after this election, b/c their silence is complicity with Trump's unconstitutional attempt to overturn an election + undermine the foundations of our democratic republic.  #Election2020results<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This article states that the measures ‚Äú... appears designed to respond to President Donald Trump's repeated and false claims that mail voting is rife with fraud.‚Äù Even though the article also states that there‚Äôs simply &gt;&gt;no evidence&lt;&lt; of the alleged fraud.  So vote suppression.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Texas AG Ken Paxton, under indictment since 2015 for felony securities fraud, now under investigation by the FBI, according to @AP.

<|startoftext|>Exactly. Pressuring election officials to overturn the will of voters is a crime.  Committed by the President.   https://t.co/XaHQLz21pp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump wants to be a dictator, appointed by his friends and allies, not a President voted into office by the people.

<|startoftext|>Why am I surprised by this? Shouldn't be.  That Guiliani brought an actress to play someone very disturbed by voting irregularities is consistent with hiring people to attend Trump rallies, isn't it?   Fictional describes Trump's world. #fake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When did some people decide that #democracy isn't good enough for them? And that they--in their absolute and self-appointed "wisdom"-- must therefore rule "their people" by fiat?  This old woman is utterly shocked by such authoritarianism by default. How dare they? [short thread]<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why we cannot allow McConnell to have his "liability passes" for corporations.  Please, @SenDuckworth and @SenatorDurbin--do not allow abuse of workers thru relief legislation which would reward companies like these.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never anticipated seeing anything like this.  Crying. For those losing their loved ones. For those caring for the sick and dying. For a nation, leaderless, that must endure such painful losses.  It did not have to be like this. #COVID19<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Unconscionable. Withholding info that would reunite these kids w/parents is cruel &amp; unjust.  Those involved in Trump administration #FamilySeparation should be investigated. Knowingly and willfully torturing children, which is exactly what this policy led to, ought to be illegal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This woman--at a Michigan "hearing"--reminded me of the @SNL Weekend Update feature "Girl You Wish You Hadn't Started a Conversation With at a Party" --and she made exactly that much sense, too.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Before Trump, President Nixon, who had authorized a break-in at the DNC to steal election info + sabotaged foreign policy for the outgoing President, was the most despised President in my lifetime. As we did w/Nixon, we'll find out more ab. Trump &amp; assoc. once he leaves office...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This terrifies me as much as the actual events b/c these lies make it extremely difficult to find common ground going forward.   Propaganda poisons government and society.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So #GOP endorses voter fraud now?  #Republicans who do should be investigated and removed from office.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pompeo has as many moral scruples, and respect for public health, as Trump.  [Obviously currying favor with potential donors for his political ambitions is how this event comes off, during this holiday season in a #pandemic as public health officials warn against gatherings.]<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The point of the PPP loans was to aid small businesses that might not survive the required lockdowns / shutdowns.  And yet... #Corruption<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timodc @PressSec Branding any vaccine as a Trump vaccine is like stealing intellectual property.  Those who brought their knowledge, expertise, skill, and ingenuity to bear on a global pandemic deserve all the credit. Trump's only possible contribution? Undoing safety regulations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Miminorton9 @carriecordero I live in IL too, and yes, Blago deserves to be finishing his sentence. The pardon was a travesty of justice.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Seriously, we need to  -reduce electioneering time (max. 3 months?)  -limit $ campaigns can spend (no, money is not speech) -keep elections relatively local, ex. for Pres. &amp; VP  Only way to increase representative democracy. Otherwise, this kind of oligarchy reigns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of all the horrors the Trump era produced, #FamilySeparation policies haunt me.   The trauma inflicted upon innocent children and their parents--for the "crime" of seeking a better life, something this country was known for for decades--will  be an indelible moral blight on US.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One thing that's confused me re: GOP response to #COVID19:  How does the party of personal responsibility become the party that flaunts it by refusing to wear masks or stay at home during a #pandemic?  Does "freedom" trump "personal responsibility"? Is it supposed to make sense?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always struck me as odd too.  Crimes of increasing severity: Stealing your laptop: Harsh jail sentence Stealing your retirement: $10K fine Stealing your democracy: {Shrug}  Incomprehensible to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look at this chart of the distribution of PPP funding. That's just obviously a give-away to companies that gamed the system.  #ppploans #Corruption #SBA  https://t.co/mdA2uVwwsj  https://t.co/8Mi5zSqGTT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why small businesses suffered at the beginning of the #COVID19 #pandemic:  "...most of the $522 billion went to about 600 larger companies and chains" AND "There is also increasing evidence that the program was subject to considerable fraud." #corruption  https://t.co/mdA2uVwwsj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One does not worry that his successor "may seek retribution" unless he's aware that crimes were committed and fears for cohorts' complicity.  No other president in my lifetime (publicly) expressed such a concern, nor did he issue pre-emptive pardons.  Consciousness of guilt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Settle down.  We don't know  -who tried to procure a Presidential pardon -who might be pardoned -what crimes were committed (to necessitate a pardon) -what was offered in return for the pardon and -whether Trump was directly involved  So...Breathe. #BriberyForPardon<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What does this even mean if you cannot eat in closed restaurants? Are they going to deduct their food truck take-out?  I mean...Americans are going to be evicted, they're waiting in lines miles long for food, and THIS is McConnell's priority?  Disgusted.  #CovidRelief<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump cannot even provide the grace of a phone call or visit, things that were given to him by his previous opponent and White House predecessor.  Good sportsmen congratulate their opponents for their wins.  Trump has such a small, petty, and self-indulgent perspective.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They forced people to work in person and now they want no accountability? Thinking, in particular, of Smithfield + other meat packing industry cos. who failed to protect their workers.  NO liability shields for corporations.  Do not allow this, @SenatorDurbin and @SenDuckworth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump wanted to know what happened to the DOJ, b/c he was apparently hoping for help from them to overturn the election.  But Trump's claims have no basis, so... #Election2020   https://t.co/V6hVDZiwJh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Watching the president attack democracy itself makes my blood boil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just today Trump encouraged the governor of Georgia to call off an election. Trump does not believe in democracy. His belief is in power for its own sake.  There's no bloodline inheritance of the US Presidency. People who don't believe in democracy don't belong anywhere near it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An important distinction, although many people on Twitter have been over-generalizing about race and gender in candidate preference.  Educational attainment made a large difference in how white women evaluated candidates and chose to vote for them.  #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IOW, the work of a con man.  Trump's claims have zero evidence to back them up. His 39 lawsuits proved that.  According to the man Trump put in charge of securing elections at CISA, Chris Krebs, the #Election was the most secure in US history.  #Election2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Here you go, again: Trump keeps trying to find scapegoats for his loss--people in his own government.  The paranoia that everyone is against him is stunning, and possibly part of a mental disorder.  #Election2020  https://t.co/zIOM1gqWGl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump conjures conspiracy theories that have at their base his desire to avoid an inconvenient + uncomfortable truth: he lost.

<|startoftext|>Taking credit for the knowledge, ingenuity, and planning of an entire network of scientists and biomedical community who began work while Trump denied that #COVID19 was a disease to even worry about seems like one of the more deplorable claims Trump has made.  Beyond shameful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How many courts must assert that Trump‚Äôs lawsuits presented NO EVIDENCE of fraud in the 2020 election before people accept that truth?  Aren‚Äôt 39 lawsuits enough?  #Election2020  #Election2020results<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Exactly right.  One election is never equivalent to another. Candidates change. Social and economic conditions change. What concerns voters changes.  Trump &amp; assoc. are looking for "reasons" that cannot be quantified. They're trying to justify his loss. #Election2020results<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this asserting that Trump has no concept of reality--that he cannot grasp the meaning of numbers, or that courts have not repeatedly ruled against his unfounded claims?  If so: The President is undoubtedly delusional.  That is a mental illness.  https://t.co/kOhYlpWVvp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously worrying about 'learning loss' and what granting 'hold harmless' grading to students means for their educations, their futures, and society in general.

<|startoftext|>Irritated.  Imagine you made a fabulous Thanksgiving--really outdid yourself--and your guest arrived late, &amp; then took credit for the meal b/c he chose to attend.  That's an analogy for Trump taking credit for a much-needed #vaccine, that required years of knowledge + experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those who **created** the vaccines deserve credit.  Someone who was in office while these inventors worked does not deserve credit for what others--with their knowledge, skill, and inventiveness--did.  Expecting credit is like stolen valor. Despicable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While this day may not be the same as other years, its meaning, gratitude, persists.  I've spent several holidays over the years in hospitals.

<|startoftext|>Why Democrats have balked at negotiations:  Trump's administration is trying to fight a major #pandemic by hamstringing Americans impacted by it--such as airport employees, hotel &amp; restaurant workers, retail salespersons--and they won't even consider providing aid.

<|startoftext|>Toomey's comment is exactly how Trump's attempt to overturn a free and fair election should be greeted, by journalists, politicians, and the public.  This is hardly Bush-Gore 2000.

<|startoftext|>Thought this could happen, after 2 MI GOP officials were summoned to DC, in spite of their declaration Friday.

<|startoftext|>Illinois, we're in the thick of this #COVID19 outbreak.  Please follow DPH guidelines and mitigations. #Illinois   https://t.co/jX1DmIJ1R2  https://t.co/t56xU8QYMh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This outbreak of #COVID19 will overwhelm our health resources before it's over.  Shocking numbers of cases. And increases in deaths usually follow within a couple of weeks.  Please #WearAMask #StayHome and #StaySafe.  https://t.co/PQL46F8dHs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's what it looks like over here, too, but we're no experts. We've just lived through decades of Presidential transitions.  And we've watched Trump's 'victory is vengeance' displays when he's thwarted before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heads up, Thanksgiving gatherers.  A negative #COVID19 test isn't enough to ensure that you won't develop symptoms or infect others during your get-togethers this week. Here's why.   https://t.co/4h9kTpqlOc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump fights to do a job he doesn't really want to do, while avoiding his duties and responsibilities while he's President.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely essential, when so many have lost jobs or assistance. Dr. Bright's second tweet gives you more info on national food resources.  Locally, I donate regularly to  https://t.co/Nn4H5Fqb6s  Let's keep America fed and healthy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Starting to look like the entire #Republican party--nor merely Trump--cannot handle losing a national election.  #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like Trump did in fact get to them, in spite of their post-meeting statement.  This is a state where Biden leads by &gt;150,000 votes.  A reminder that conspiring to interfere in an election is a felony. #Michigan #Republicans should know that.  https://t.co/pdImcdVigC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Graham‚Äôs alleged request is unseemly and corrupt. But is it criminal? In short, yes, according to multiple Georgia election law experts. If Raffensperger‚Äôs account is true, there is virtually no doubt that Graham committed a crime under Georgia law."  https://t.co/AIgKp5EtM4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FEC (Federal Election Commission) Commissioner:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are making a mockery of #democracy.  And it's to our national shame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Source for above quote: #COVID19   https://t.co/3VugdgmjUd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Personal risk for #COVID19 now:  "Thanksgiving does not exist in isolation. It‚Äôs not a thing one family is doing alone. And it will be followed, over the next month and a half, by a series of gathering-friendly events, including Black Friday, Hanukkah, Christmas and New Year‚Äôs."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today the US had a record number of #COVID19 cases, and no sign of decreases.  And if any of those people needs hospital care, it's going to be harder to come by.  22% of US hospitals need more staff; in some states it's 35%. We can't go on like this.  https://t.co/FvLnSAAGml<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thinking that this must be emphasized.  Trump definitely never uses persuasion.  He's all about bullying and using threats to effect his desired aims. Just like any mob boss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Starting to wish there was an exam regarding a variety of laws, but particularly election law, that candidates for federal office had to pass in order to even appear on their state's ballots.  Some of the explanations given are...dubious and in error, at best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not ab. protecting anyone. Not even about celebrating.  It's an ostentatious use of taxpayer funds as a kind of personal vengeance on being thrown out of office; he'll also promulgate the lie that he's not leaving.  #TrumpCorruption<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got news for you, @GSAEmily. That oath you took? It was to the Constitution of the United States. And you owe your loyalty to that, not to a party or a man, to ensure a peaceful transition.  While you're stalling and waffling, national security is at stake. Do your job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought Republicans were known for scorning feelings, not respecting them--or having delicate feelings themselves.  When did that change?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bravo, @SenDuckworth.  Proud to have you represent our state.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JRubinBlogger Hold what line? Georgia just certified its election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As of today, due to #COVID19, we've been at home for 252 days (8 months, 1 week).  A very long time to go w/o seeing family or friends in person.  For #Thanksgiving, we'll continue staying at home b/c we want to stay well &amp; we want our loved ones to do the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, since conspiring to interfere with an election is a felony, each of these Michigan legislators should have considered whether to insist their counsel be present at any meeting w/Trump before they departed.  Now it may be too late. Everyone knows how easily #TrumpLies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Grocery workers to stop #COVID19:  Stockman A to Stockman B: "Mask goes over your nose." Stockman B: "It comes off when I talk." Stockman A: "Gotta keep it on."  This is at a store where a manager's wedding resulted in 25 cases among coworkers.  Bravo &amp; thanks, essential workers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MMcHarry Just one of those "flyover states" in the Midwest. &lt;waving hands away&gt; Aren't they all the same?   LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After this, how can anyone take their "elite strike force" seriously on anything?  At the most generous, they're basing their election  "theories" on errors. At worst, they're willfully misleading the public and undermining #democracy based on nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So now Trump is making offers state Republicans can't refuse, to paraphrase from a famous film, so he can overthrow an election--America's sovereign votes.  #Republicans should stand up for #democracy now, without delay.  #TrumpCorruption<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everything @maddow is telling us now about #COVID19 (and her beloved) is something the country really needs to hear.  Thinking of Rachel and Susan and hoping for the very best for Susan's recovery.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About time.   Those who spread #disinformation that undermines #democracy should definitely suffer consequences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This.  #COVID19 #vaccines   https://t.co/uKJ0SkWNMS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone... #COVID19 cases are increasing at a rapid rate.  If we don't hunker down over Thanksgiving, the post-holiday number of cases could spoil our Christmas celebrations. And some of us may not be around to celebrate. Please: #WearAMask #StayHome #StaySafe #FlattenTheCurve<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are ~330M people in the US and these vaccines require two injections per person.  The idea that we're going to be back to what most people think of as 'normal' by early next year seems like a pipe dream. Manufacture and distribution will take longer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So alarmed today that I cannot stop doomscrolling.  If ever a term met its moment, this is it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Their silence is complicity w/Trump's efforts to undermine our #democracy.  Where are those who have the courage to address Trump AND to publicly call out these threats to our republic which despoil our public discourse?  We, the people, are righteously outraged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly what concerns me.  This is why @JoeBiden needs to have advisors who understand today's so-called Republicans. Many are scorched-earth people. And, like Trump, they don't believe in #democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Story ab. Michican legislators invited to meet w/Trump. Another part of Trump's soft rolling coup attempt.  Overturning the election b/c you lost is clearly an attack on our democratic republic and should be framed as such. Trump is a danger to the nation.  https://t.co/ExeYYxtDAv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This. Undermining #democracy.  Because Trump's having a tantrum that he lost.   https://t.co/zS5heSi0dY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Conspiracy to commit election fraud is definitely a crime.  Just sayin'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great. Trump is going to try to influence the Michigan legislature in an attempt to overturn a free and fair election. Because he's unhappy that he lost.  There's nothing he won't do--just try to imagine what's possible--to get his way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did the framers of the Constitution foresaw what they allege is happening?  These attorneys should be disbarred for the disinformation they're foisting on the public.  "Elite strike force"? Bless their hearts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely irresponsible.  Doesn't she realize that this is incitement for which she could be investigated, and potentially disbarred or even arrested?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AND they're afraid of his voters.  Never forget that #Republicans believe they cannot afford to lose their shrinking base.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If he had enough evidence, they would not be 1-29 in court. But courts have ruled repeatedly that they do not have evidence, and Trump attorneys have told judges repeatedly that they are not alleging fraud.  This is a PR stunt b/c they want to overturn a free and fair election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Paying attention to the Trump campaign's clear disinformation program only gives it live and oxygen.  Stopping now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And they're targeting #democracy.  So...they're not sworn to "defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic", I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bottom line: Trump attorneys cannot win in court so they're trying to win thru disinformation.  But: Math simply can't solve for lies.  The Trump campaign needs to stop this attack on #democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>STOP--just STOP--saying that the votes of entire counties can be thrown out just b/c you wish they could.  This is democratic blasphemy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good grief.  Desperation leads down dark alleyways...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These #COVID19 drugs are not available to most people, and they won't be either due to supply or insurance.  ONLY the President + a handful of others in the entire US got  monoclonal antibodies, for example. Remdesivir is reserved for specific hospitalized populations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heads-up, states.  Closing schools and leaving bars &amp; restaurants open = not recommended.  We can see your desire for revenues but...public safety concerns should rule. #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That fear bleeds over to Illinois. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker mentioned the Michigan case during Tuesday's COVID-19 update. "We have threats that stream into my office daily, while we have watched the kidnapping plot against the Michigan governor unfold just a state away," he said<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IOW, #Republicans oppose #democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The problem for Trump &amp; assoc.:  Alleging misconduct is one thing. Proving misconduct in court means they must have evidence.  So far, try as they might, none of their cases have proven misconduct in any election, often due to lack of evidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Trump is the incumbent claiming he won in 2020 but is also planning to run in 2024:  Doesn't that mean he knows that he lost in 2020, since a President is confined to two terms?  As usual, Trump remains incoherent and chaotic. #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Proving, again, that Trump will try to interfere in the election however he can, including whatever it was that he said to these election officials who now want to "rescind" their votes.  The sooner Trump leaves, the better off the country will be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"One of the two Republican election officials in Wayne County, Mich., who filed affidavits Wednesday evening seeking to ‚Äúrescind‚Äù certification of the county‚Äôs results received a call from President Trump the night before thanking her for her support..."  https://t.co/mJX7lkf74H<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump and allies are becoming the monarchs of frivolous lawsuits. 1 out of 29 is a terrible average.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is: 25th Amendment  Problem: Those who have the power to use it won't consider it.  Electing ethical and competent people is absolutely critical to the nation's well-being; Senate confirmation for the Cabinet is also critical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still wondering whether people are OK with this, b/c we are definitely not, here in our little corner of the country.  Undermining #democracy itself should be enough to call for the resignation of a man who worked to undermine free and fair elections.  #LindseyGrahamResign<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Appeals to the past as some kind of 'golden era' fail to note how much resistance there was to messaging about   generosity, sacrifice, or change during the period around WWII.  And what ab. today, w/#COVID19 restrictions?  https://t.co/Nr57vL2EVf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is deliberately spreading public health misinformation / disinformation about a #pandemic that could take lives illegal?  Would seem like a reasonable law, since it could result in loss of life.  Asking for millions of Americans. #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IOW, Trump is only interested in a recount in areas where he's lost. This is a terrible approach to election recounts and ought to be called out as such.  They cannot know for sure whether those counties were "the worst" b/c they are not reviewing all other counties.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Attempts to point to 1 questionable vote here or 10 "concerning" votes there are actually trying to obscure these numbers and the vote margins between the candidates overall + in key states.  Fact: Mathematically, Trump cannot win. He's attacking #democracy. #ElectionResults2020  https://t.co/6ZmlqqooL7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Popular vote totals (so far):  Biden   79,191,817 votes (51.0%) Trump  73,408,716 votes (47.2%)  Difference 5,783,101  Not close. #ElectionResults2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Astonishing.  #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Truly a new low for #Republicans in Congress.  Undermining #democracy used to be taboo. Now, it's just {shrug}. Despicable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When the man who's been fact checking Trump for years tells you this, believe it.  #TrumpLies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump‚Äôs false claims‚Äîwhich he has failed to prove in court ~25 times‚Äîare nevertheless undermining the public‚Äôs faith in #democracy. And therefore in the United States itself.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Republicans from times past. Men of integrity and honor. Men who loved their country and Constitution more than fealty to a corrupt leader.  Are there any #Republicans like them today? Or has the entire party become so utterly corrupt that representative democracy is unpalatable?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Why we cannot use *deaths* as a measure of how bad #COVID19 is.  It can have serious longer-term impacts.

<|startoftext|>Read this thread last night and cannot stop thinking ab. it.  Denying that #COVID19 is real...when you have it...and are in the hospital being treated for it. üò≥  Please come to your senses. The virus does not consider whether you believe in it or not.  https://t.co/XcueO9ewAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The desire to live in their fantasies seems truly and shockingly popular among around half of all Americans.  But let's remember: -A virus doesn't care ab. whether you believe in it -Math still works even if you deny its reality  Denial won't protect you from either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The virus doesn't care ab. a person's confidence in avoiding infection. #COVID19   "The percentage feeling very or somewhat confident in their ability to avoid infection rose from 68% in mid-April to 82% in June and has since remained at that level."  https://t.co/ikk85tJOWG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doesn't sound at all like representative #democracy when you put it that way.  We must fix the Senate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most electors are bound by law to respect election results and vote for the winner.  These Republicans are asking electors to break the laws of their states in order to steal an election.  Astounding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump's feelings ab. the election should be subsumed to defending #democracy, a duty he swore to uphold.  He's filed &gt;20 lawsuits to test whether there was election fraud. They found &gt;none&lt;.  The election will be certified. #Elections2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hard to lie ab. these numbers. Biden 78,664,203 votes (50.8%) Trump 73,108,131 votes (47.2%)  Argue w/math if you like.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And math just does not lie, or rig an election. Biden 78,664,203 votes (50.8%) Trump 73,108,131 votes (47.2%)  Biden got more votes. Trump lost fair and square.   https://t.co/xzk7fpnxvA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If there were any real truth to Trump's claims, he would have won in court.  But there is no merit to any of his court cases, although his attorneys filed and lost ~20.  Someone needs to tell him how to lose like a real man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump's endless whining ab. losing shouldn't be treated as if there's a question ab. election results.  He's undermining faith in democracy just to salve his bruised ego, something no American should tolerate.   Behaving w/o dignity or grace is also unbecoming a President.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Pritzker notes that we need a national strategy to address the #COVID19 #pandemic, because we have many states surrounding IL who are doing little mitigation, and that affects IL's case counts and healthcare staffing availability.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Watching IL Gov. Pritzker's press conference re: the state's #COVID19 #pandemic new wave of cases.  IDPH asks residents to limit travel.

<|startoftext|>We need a full accounting of the #USPS fiasco.  This whole thread on various types of election interference, voter suppression, and "hijinks" should be read by all Americans before we demand that Congress act to ensure elections are fair and w/o blemish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jacobsoboroff Love it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is math is just too hard for #Republicans? Or are they simply opposed to #democracy itself?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. True for me when I was raising children in the 1980s. Now it's true for my daughter raising my grandchildren. Women should not be penalized.  When will society take steps to support working  parents raising the next generation? #parenting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Republicans are sore losers.  They're exuberant when they win, mocking their opponents. ("Get over it! You lost!)  They claim elections are "stolen" from them when they lose. (As if they were entitled to win.)  What is the opposite of good sportsmanship?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This seems like...a claim w/o substantiating evidence.  Why do we keep hearing those from conservatives?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG, yes.  With McConnell committed to eliminating #SocialSecurity, which he plans to propagandize on austerity propaganda, I am truly hoping that Democratic candidates can win the two seats in Georgia and go on to protect the meager benefits that keep seniors from poverty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's face it:  Many #Republicans tried to suppress voting everywhere they had power. Now they want to deny the actual results of a free and fair election.  They're showing themselves as enemies of #democracy.   #Election2020results<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The idea that only *some* votes count but others do not, even when all were legitimate is nefarious in its premise.  Trump wants to "win" by claiming that only votes for HIM should be counted. Trump is the one who wants to overturn the election.  Don't buy in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turns out, you need evidence, not simply wishful thinking, in order to win lawsuits, @realDonaldTrump.  And your lawyers are being embarrassed in court b/c they have no evidence. That reflects badly on you, the President, who demanded they file these baseless lawsuits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hard to find words for this horror. These women lost parts of their bodies--unnecessarily--while under US detention and "care".  One of many reasons why there can be no reconciliation with those who committed these atrocities until there is a reckoning.  #immigration<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump's people are terrible at research. They did not find what they claimed to have found. Their claims were baseless.  But they were willing to lie about it. Disgustingly unethical.  #Election2020results<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What makes anyone think #Republicans will cooperate with a Biden Presidency? Sabotage is more likely. With McConnell as Majority Leader, that's what the country will get.  The Georgia Senate run-offs will be crazy. Get busy, #Democrats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And Trump isn't interested in governing. He's more interested in the performative aspects of the Presidency than the actual work.  He'd rather play the President on TV than govern.  https://t.co/hu2SLneDcc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What made me support Biden: Experience matters.  Trump's admin. floundered (in part) b/c they lacked it--and failed to learn under pressure as well.  Government is NOT business. Biden knows what governing means.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Math.  Popular vote (as of 11/11/2020): Biden 77.3M  (50.8%) Trump 72.2M  (47.4%) &gt;5 million more votes for Biden  Electoral College votes (so far) Biden 279 Trump 217 (with only 42 outstanding) Trump cannot catch up.

<|startoftext|>What are #Republicans doing? Trying to undermine #democracy in their desperate yet futile attempt to retain power. Votes are 'irrelevant'.

<|startoftext|>Trump &amp; allies have challenged his loss in court 12 times and lost every single time.  Trump lost. He needs to stop suing and accept that Biden won.  Math is completely clear.

<|startoftext|>Beyond the pale.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not about making sense.  It's always ab. Trump's emotions. He's a reactive man; when he feels bad, he blames others and lashes out, whether it makes sense or not. If he's been nursing a grudge, he'll take punitive actions--such as firing--to help himself feel in control.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ICYMI, on @60Minutes last night, there was a feature on getting a #vaccine to the public.  Keeping the vaccine extremely cold is just one of the challenges of distribution.  https://t.co/hfr47jOc5X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another Trump official, HUD Sec. Ben Carson, is positive for #COVID19.  "Carson and his wife, Candy, traveled to events in Florida and Georgia ahead of the election. Masks went largely unworn during the events."   https://t.co/MTfhDYf8as<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>THIS is how to applaud the development of a much-needed #vaccine--giving credit to those whose knowledge, ingenuity, and hard work made it possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely.  Anyone in the intelligence units that angered or upset Trump will be fair game.  This is the beginning of "settling family business", as Michael Corleone called it. And it's likely to look like a massacre.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Undoubtedly this is part of it.  Trump will install loyal insiders in every position he thinks benefits his delusion that he will remain in power. First, the military, he hopes will surround his eventual "victory" and protect him from interlopers.   https://t.co/JXqeiCrDPx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No doubt the first of many.  Trump's loyalty extends to one person. No matter what anyone has done for him, it's never enough, as @MaryLTrump's book title captures.  Trump is gleeful in victory but vengeful in defeat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If we look at Presidential election results as they stand today, it is mathematically impossible for Trump to win.  But Trump has trouble facing reality. And supporters are willing to indulge his delusions, to the detriment of the country.  #Election2020results<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not exactly. The vaccine was initially developed by a German company, BioNTech, &amp; partnered w/Pfizer for human trials b/c it did not have that capability.

<|startoftext|>When I saw Dr. Rick Bright's name on this list, tears came to my eyes.  Justice just does that, I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OR...  We could admit that this is what is happening--a campaign to assuage Trump's bruised ego--and move on, spending very little time publicizing the ill-fated attempt to "prove" his delusional claims.  #Election2020results<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YES.  For years TV networks broadcast Trump's lies w/o context:  Promoted Trump's evidence-free claims, spread false public health info, and became PR for Trump-era propaganda.  Do better in future, media. #journalism<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Why Democrats want to win run-off elections in Georgia:  They will chair the Senate, including the Judiciary Committee which reviews Cabinet and all judicial appointments, putting McConnell &amp; Graham in the minority.  Let's elect @JonOssoff and @ReverendWarnock to the Senate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>See? #Republicans &gt;demand&lt; courtesies and concessions, even in defeat. And Democrats often capitulate. Not this time, Democrats.  Graham's Judiciary failed to hold a fair hearing on #impeachment evidence. Hoping Graham falls into the minority soon.   https://t.co/iLz475Jxeo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump is playing the abuser's game:  "See how you hurt me? If you didn't hurt me, I would not have to punish you."  This is a blame-the-victim game, and America doesn't need to play it.  Do NOT give Trump the attention he craves, b/c that continues his abusive conduct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To allow Trump to continue to to undermine trust in our institutions just to assuage his hurt feelings is abuse.  We must call it out for what it is--abusing his power to persuade millions that American #democracy is completely fractured.  The election just proved that's false.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Especially galling when their candidate had no policy platform...and they went along with that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cannot stop hearing #Republicans saying (even shouting) "Elections have consequences" to Democrats for the past 4 years.  Galling to hear their calls for concessions on policy from Democrats now. Galling to hear them whispering on how to obstruct a Biden administration too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>See? #Republicans &gt;demand&lt; courtesies and concessions, even in defeat. And Democrats often capitulate.  Not this time, Democrats. Not before the #TrumpCorruption, which includes complicit Republicans, has been completely purged do we even begin negotiating ab. policies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So sick of this #Trump #Corruption.  Literally feeling nausea just reading this tweet.  All of these corrupt officials must be purged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lying to viewers and calling it "news"? That's @FoxNews' daily grind.  Their lawyers even claimed in a slander lawsuit against Tucker Carlson by claiming you can't believe anything he says. And they won.  https://t.co/I8QsSGTdtv<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Astonishingly good #COVID19 news.  This university tests everyone on campus. When cases are diagnosed, contact tracing occurs.  Most of the cases were early on. Their case positivity rate is under 1%.  THAT is how it's done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not surprising that #Republicans deny that Biden won the election.  Denial of reality is a big part of their brand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Avoiding accountability cannot be allowed.  Trump + his administration officials must be held accountable for atrocities such as -parents separated from children -forced hysterectomies -COVID deaths -election interference -financial fraud + more  b/c they did it all on purpose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Trump is defrauding the public by raising money to "fight voter fraud".  And it's in the fine print, so no one donating can sue.  Don the Con strikes again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last 24 hours: When Democrats win, #Republicans do not mourn their losses. They demand courtesies and concessions from the winners. They don't do retrospectives; they think losing was "bad luck".  Boldly entitled. A reason why no GOP should not get the special treatment demanded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump is on a timer. Time's up Jan. 20, whether he accepts his loss or not.  Ridiculous clickbait, @CNNi. The nation isn't waiting for babysitters to encourage a child to do the inevitable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteButtigieg Reconciliation always requires reckoning.  Yes, we can provide openings and they're important. But the real work of reconciliation comes in confronting what happened and providing repairs to the breach. It's hard work, and it takes time.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Why national standards are necessary.  I look at our state--IL--in the midst of all that red and recall the sacrifices we made to flatten the curve.

<|startoftext|>@KevinMKruse @julianzelizer @USATODAY Great article.   I was a young woman when Nixon resigned.

Reckoning is always necessary for reconciliation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In order to have reconciliation, there must be a reckoning. The body politic doesn't self-heal.  The wound of Nixon's malfeasance / crimes never healed in many of us who were young when he resigned and Ford pardoned him. Never forgave any of them.  Agree w/Kruse.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Many of us got sick of the blatant lying, misinformation, and propaganda--as the necessary masks over these tweets show--and we voted for someone who will be straight with us.  And Trump still cannot stop lying to the American people. C'mon, man--stop it already. #TrumpLies  https://t.co/6uqZ3nq6Px<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ellen Weintraub, Commissioner at the Federal Election Commission: "None of the complaints have attached any evidence of fraud."  IOW, there ARE formal complaints by Republicans but they contain NO EVIDENCE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Feels like the Trump Vengeance Initiative has begun...and it's rather ominous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Makes me irritable that people keep calling the dedication of these election workers &amp; officials (who &gt;risked their health&lt; so that the rest of us could vote and then hear election results) into question.  We should be lauding them as heroes of #democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These #COVID19 White House super-spreader events are beginning to make me absolutely livid.  What about a viral #pandemic is so hard to understand? The virus doesn't care whether you "believe" in it. Its goal is to find hosts. And it's winning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neal_katyal Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Many challenges will come our way in the next 2.5 months. We can say that on Jan. 20, 2021.  Until then, Trump still has the reins, and he's riding a rabid horse accompanied by feral dogs. And armed vigilantes roam the hills.  Vigilance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#COVID19 is not "going away" just b/c Trump + his people want to pretend that its fantasy disappearance is always imminent.   Spreading it to others by concealing your infection is nefariously evil. Trump's administration is beyond irresponsible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When eyes have been so closely watching the election numbers that these #COVID19 numbers slipped past many of us.  And they are shocking.  @VinGuptaMD just said on @MSNBC that everyone should be wearing a 3-ply mask and re-thinking both airline travel &amp; Thanksgiving plans.  https://t.co/6o3sxrwLEI<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Another incredibly important point.  We do not hate our worthy opponents, even though we're very competitive with them.  Once an election is over, we bind any wounds and accept the outcome, win or lose.  #CountEveryVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Incredibly important.  As a democratic republic, our first principle is that our votes are our voices. We cannot silence anyone who cast a valid ballot.  #CountEveryVote<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Election fraud mega thread.  Bottom line: These claims just do not hold up. #ElectionResults2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many people who claimed to "love our country" don't seem pleased w/#democracy when every vote must be counted &amp; the will of the people has been determined.  But that's what democracy is: Letting voters decide who will lead them. Doesn't always go your way.  #Election2020results<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. You don't make the claim and then rustle up the evidence later.  You have to have evidence to make the claim. Results of an election aren't decided by vague hypotheses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AND the reason the US is a hotbed of #COVID19 is that Trump failed in his response to controlling the #pandemic?  Trump supporters are stuck here for now, unless they have dual citizenship with another nation (or have the funds to escape to a welcoming nation for 4 yrs.).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was Republicans' plan.  Give away revenues w/tax cuts to their wealthy donors.  Make ordinary people suffer w/o government services and benefits...and eliminate #SocialSecurity and #Medicare.  Democrats have to work hard to elect Senators from Georgia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People who know *nothing* about how elections work are very busy trying to cast doubt on normal election processes.  It is *normal* to cure ballots. It has been for a very long time.  Please do not give uninformed people the right to create chaos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About time. #HatchActViolations   https://t.co/qEleOmmho9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Horrifying. &gt;120,000 cases in a single day.  Just an FYI: We are not "rounding the curve"; it will not "disappear like a miracle". The #COVID19 #pandemic is serious.

<|startoftext|>Democracy heroines: We salute you all!  Thank you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NO future Presidential candidate, of either party, should be allowed to take office without divestiture.  Congress must ensure that happens.  Trump was a national security risk. The US can't have that again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heads-up, @FoxNews.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG. That's right. If the race is called for Biden, there will be dogs in the White House again!  I will be so happy if we can welcome Major and Champ to the people's house, @JoeBiden and @DrBiden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People, this should be the theme song: Dancing in the Streets  Part of the lyrics: Philadelphia, PA (dancing in the street) Baltimore and D.C. now (dancing in the street) Can't forget the Motor City (dancing in the street)  üòÄ  https://t.co/gWpPcaHwpb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also:  Imagine the party that engaged in voter suppression--by closing polling sites, limiting voting hours, and downplaying #MailInVoting-- being thwarted by their own suppression in limiting their own voters.  Voter suppression hurts democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously? Two days before the election?  Republicans have never reconciled w/the fact that Americans LIKE #Obamacare (aka #ACA).  Not sure how many Georgians knew ab. this change, tho. #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Correct.  Narcissists are never graceful losers. They are vengeful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know I will cry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And don‚Äôt let them forget their cowardice in the face of threats to our democracy. Their silence was complicity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly.  Never assume we can be complacent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump never had to grow up, experience adversity and related loss, shame, or humiliation. He‚Äôs lived an entire lifetime w/o maturing. As a narcissist, he cannot accept the loss of face, which is devastating.   His suffering will become the nation‚Äôs as well. Prepare for that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. Some people actually think the #COVID19 #pandemic is under control. With new record numbers of cases &amp; no treatment or vaccine. Trump apparently convinced them without a shred of evidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benjaminwittes Impermanence<|endoftext|>

And this is what happens in autocracies around the world when frustrated autocrats use propaganda and lies to hoodwink the populace.  Shocking in the USA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Among Trump's lies, this one stands out to me, b/c he would like to blame the opposition when in fact GA is run by Republicans. He cannot find his scapegoat.  He's blithely lying to let off steam since he just cannot handle even the potential of losing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haven't been watching the #TrumpLieFest but from what I'm reading, it's sure to set off some of his supporters.  Trump is the same in defeat as he is in triumph: An unredeemable liar and an unjustified braggart who believes he's entitled to whatever he wants.  #CountEveryVote<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"The number of mailed ballots not delivered by Nov. 3 is expected to grow as more postal data is released in the coming days."

<|startoftext|>Remember this. Memorize it.  These are not ‚Äúlate ballots‚Äù.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump general life strategy:  If you don‚Äôt get what you want, claim the outcome is unfair to you. File a lawsuit. Appeal unfavorable rulings to the highest courts. Drag the thing out until opponents are exhausted of time, $, &amp; patience. Never give in.  Election is no different.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn‚Äôt it ‚Äúterrible‚Äù when all votes are counted? Even those that voted absentee, by mail, from military posts overseas?  Trump doesn‚Äôt believe in democracy.  That many people who claim to love the US‚Äîand all that it stands for, especially democracy‚Äîvoted for him is baffling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad to see this outcome.  Now ALL Illinois voters‚Äô taxes will have to be raised, b/c revenues have fallen sharply for the state due to a variety of factors, including the #pandemic.  #FairTax #fairtaxillinois<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. The corrupt intent seems obvious.   #CountAllTheVotes  #CountEveryVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don‚Äôt understand why #DeJoy should not be held in contempt of court at the very least after ignoring the court order to expedite ballot delivery.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And millions voted for him in spite of his desire to overthrow democracy.   Really appalling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So is there no remedy in states that don‚Äôt count ballots received after Election Day? Should votes be discarded when they weren‚Äôt received thru no fault of the voter?  Hoping the judge can shed light on this.   #CountEveryVote<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Another Trump lie from last night's debate.

<|startoftext|>On the very day that Trump claimed that the US is "turning a corner" on the #COVID19 #pandemic, the country set &gt;a new record&lt; for daily cases.  Trump is a congenital liar.  He simply cannot tell Americans the truth.  We need a President who can level with us.  #BidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Concur unambiguously.  @nytimes doing "both sides" about a debate where one candidate lied more than ever (see @ddale8) is journalistic malpractice.  &gt;Normalizing lying&lt; by someone holding the highest office in the land should provide endless shame for the newspaper.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Happy a man in his 70s did not have a temper tantrum." C'mon.

<|startoftext|>People think Trump did well? Seriously?  He lied in an overwhelming fashion. Repeatedly. We heard nothing about his vision for America. He bragged ab. 'accomplishments' that were not true. (Lincoln? Really?)  How is that doing well?  #Debate2020  #PresidentialDebate2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Biden's right: The House passed the HEROES Act in May.  McConnell has ignored it ever since.  #Debates2020  #PresidentialDebate2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly.  Also, Biden is not talking about "destroying #Medicare". The only people planning to do that are Republicans, including Trump.  #Debates2020  #PresidentialDebate2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump's claim that Biden did nothing on healthcare is malarkey.  Biden was the VP when #Obamacare was passed!!  #PresidentialDebate2020  #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly.  #Obamacare protects pre-existing conditions.  Trump + Republicans are hoping #SCOTUS will invalidate it, which will eliminate protections for those with pre-existing conditions. #PresidentialDebate2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump on #Obamacare: "What we'd like to do is terminate it."  He's been talking about his healthcare plan for years but has never come up with anything.  #PresidentialDebate2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump just keeps talking, whether Biden or the moderator is speaking, whether he's been asked to move on.  His arrogant disrespect for others is overwhelming. #PresidentialDebate2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Is there any way that Twitteratti can stop the childish phenomenon of asking mature people to "raise your hand if..."   Or should I just start blocking people who use that every day to get likes and comments?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the Senate confirms #Barrett, she will most likely vote to invalidate #Obamacare (aka #ACA).  If that happens, protections for pre-existing conditions will also be invalidated...and insurance companies can deny you insurance.  Demand that your Senators do not vote for Barrett.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump campaign just cannot help itself.  At the last debate, they brought #COVID19.  For this one, a bogus "news story" ab. a disinformation campaign reportedly pushed by foreign adversaries.  Stunts are all Trump has left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This administration doesn't care about workers either.  I have been wondering why OSHA has not issued emergency regulations for "essential" workers during the #COVID19 #pandemic. The agency did not think it was necessary...   https://t.co/YKwuZpTj2Z<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of many reasons Democrats must take the Senate.  #vote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look at this tweet: Trump makes a claim that Biden's potential court nominees would be [a derogatory epithet].  Next he tells you &gt;he doesn't even know who they are&lt;.  WHO is the unhinged person making strange claims?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So typical of Trump. No details, no policies, no programs. Just unsubstantiated claims.  If #Obamacare is struck down, insurance companies can penalize (or cancel) you for having a pre-existing condition. Like having asthma or having had #COVID19.  That's what Republicans want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly what I was hoping to hear him say.  #BidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ICYMI last year, here's more on how the #TrumpEconomy fared, compared to the #ObamaEconomy.  Trump does NOT have the "greatest economy in American history" and did not, even before #COVID19.   https://t.co/7LqSr17G0l<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And they should be held accountable--and pay a price for--this heinous conduct.  When the Senate convenes in January, the American people expect that body to reprimand any remaining GOP Senators + punish them for what they did to undermine our courts, esp. McConnell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously, we need a law:  Impeached Presidents should be prohibited from nominating jurists for #SCOTUS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure why journalists have failed to hammer home the truth about the #TrumpEconomy.  But here's his record on jobs (and click thru the link below to read more).  https://t.co/wTmD71Avdk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump always thinks he can *prove* that he was treated "unfairly" when he does stunts like this. Wrong. + Understatement of the political campaign: "As a tactical matter, Mr. Trump‚Äôs decision to release the video just hours before the last debate with Mr. Biden was curious."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump's basic (arrogant) assumption:  He gets to decide how journalists speak and he gets to decide what they should say.  The President *serves* the people, not the other way around. And the 1A ensures that journalists can ask questions and report to citizens ab. our government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Each quote seems more ridiculous.  Who pre-emptively makes up derogatory names for people he doesn't like? Who makes up lies about political opponents? Who solicits a foreign power to slander his opponent with made-up scandals? Who whines ab. any opposition? That's defense?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whiner-in-Chief complains about every female reporter who doesn't act like a suck-up.  His claims ab. Stahl are baseless. Watched the interviews: Trump interrupted her and lied when she asked important questions.  Trump simply cannot handle strong, confident women. Pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There it is.  Republicans are targeting our healthcare--along with the part in the law that  protects you from having your insurance canceled because of pre-existing conditions.  #ACA  #Obamacare  #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha. Trump thinks he should  not be asked "tough questions".  As President, he is answerable to the American people. He doesn't get to control the press. That's why they're protected by the 1A--to help the people know what their government is doing. #SixtyMinutes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When they take over the Senate in January, Democrats must punish Republicans with new rules--and possibly new #SCOTUS seats--for the absolute power grab McConnell pulled w/Garland and Barrett.  #VoteThemOut #VoteThemAllOut2020  #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Clearly, Presidents MUST divest their assets which can lead to decisions in their favor but not necessarily helpful to Americans.

<|startoftext|>Trump is fear-mongering with lies.  Moody's Analytics stated that Biden + Democrats in both houses of Congress would be best for the economy.

<|startoftext|>"A financial incentive" means they were paid to attend.  IOW people had to be paid to 1) take the risk of getting #COVID19 at the WH, 2) sign a waiver ab. the virus, and 3) listen to Trump's speech today.  Pathetic.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Citizens have a right to demonstrate their disagreement with their government. Yet Trump runs the Executive Branch.  The use of "peaceful protest" as a tagline for a Trump campaign event at the White House: The President is trolling those who disagree w/his government.  Shameful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump is still sick with #COVID19. Was wondering if Trump's lungs had adequate capacity for a long speech. Apparently not.  He should be taking care of himself during his recovery, not running desperate campaign events. He could still relapse.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Truth: "prototype for the all-too-real Trump...Queeg is incompetent, paranoid, given to bullying, prone to blame-shifting, obsessed with appearances, unable to admit error, and determined at all costs to cover up grievous misjudgments and mistakes."  https://t.co/uWZvbMnPw8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Until Democrats start talking about McConnell's refusal to fill Obama's nominations to federal courts, including "holding" a #SCOTUS nomination in the year of an election, they won't be able to get this topic to rest.  McConnell's "court packing" should be an attack ad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In 2016 Obama said, "Democracy's on the ballot."  In 2020 that assertion is even more relevant when a sitting Senator claims that "Democracy isn't the objective."   But those who prefer dictatorships cannot take away Americans' votes &amp; voices. #VOTE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This administration is acting directly against medical advice when it comes to public health and safety.  Trump + Republicans do not care about whether people get a deadly virus which has taken &gt;210,000 lives, sickened 7.5M, and caused longer-term impacts on thousands.  #VoteBlue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So this is where the country is now. Wow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This segment gave me all the feels.  My dad played semi-pro baseball and coached my brothers' Little League team. How he would have loved this story too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hillary Clinton's emails are in the news? Really?  Shhh. Not sure Trump knows this: @JoeBiden is the Democratic candidate. But Trump thinks he's still running against Hillary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislhayes Research the source of those $200 "gift cards", a $7B in-kind contribution to Trump's re-election campaign.  They may be taking the funds from the Medicare Trust Fund, which is just horrifying to me (a retiree).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The public -- and the Senate -- has a right to know whether the Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee is positive for #COVID19. So does his opponent, since they just had a debate.  Republicans are not being smart by not testing or disclosing their test results. Truth will out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What? And people are saying she's "eminently qualified" for #SCOTUS? Gobsmacked.  Slow this nomination down now.  THREAD:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every day until Nov. 3, Trump is likely to get more frantic, b/c apparently he's losing. (And he doesn't respect Biden, so it feels humiliating to him.)  After the election, during the lame duck period, regardless of the outcome, Trump's likely to seek revenge on his "enemies".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Trump will be "interviewed" on camera by a doctor known for spreading #COVID19 misinformation, including touting a drug that does not treat the virus but can have serious side-effects. We don't even know that Trump is not contagious yet.  And people will want to watch that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Trump was diagnosed on Thurs. he was almost certainly shedding virus on Tues.  Which means he exposed &gt;&gt;everyone&lt;&lt; at the debate, since he was not wearing a mask and not socially distant.  This also means crew, campaign officials, guests, and so on. #COVID19  https://t.co/sKvWWH7vUV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are crews of people in support of debates + campaign events who put their lives at risk.  If Trump was shedding virus at the last debate, consider that. AND Trump should stay in the WH until he's got proof he's **tested** negative. Insist on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump's administration did this--separated children from their parents, many of whom could not find their way back to their families. (Earlier reports detailed removing nursing infants from mothers.)  Crimes against humanity; they should be indicted.  #FamilySeparation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump claims he beat Biden in the first debate.  And then, listen to the end: Trump actually says "I beat him in the second debate also" when he just finished lying about the style of the second debate (which both campaigns had agreed to).  #TrumpIsNotWell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I recall Republicans criticizing Democrats with the line that they should not "pick and choose" who benefits from government aid.  Now, Republicans have their favorites, often leaving small business in the lurch. Yet few point that out. Glad to hear this:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"With his flat Midwestern accent and his silver-haired gladhandedness, Pence is the silk to Trump‚Äôs sandpaper." + "Pence, as head of the White House pandemic task force, should be crawling under a rock in shame.

<|startoftext|>The money is coming from THE MEDICARE TRUST FUND!!  As a senior, I don't want this trust fund to be an in-kind donor to political campaigns! This is an outrage.  Have you seen this, @AARPadvocates, @NCPSSM?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Editors of the New England Journal of Medicine:  "Anyone else who recklessly squandered lives and money in this way would be suffering legal consequences. Our leaders have largely claimed immunity for their actions. But this election gives us the power to render judgment." #Vote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Republicans can't understand why they don't have ALL the power.  An independent organization controls the debates; they are not required to consult with the campaigns when they make the rules--in this case, b/c one candidate happens to have a deadly virus. #PresidentialDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's a Republican Congressman asserting that Republicans control Americans' right to vote.  Since Republicans keep telling us they don't really believe in a democratic republic, let's #VoteThemAllOut before they try to make it impossible for our voices to be heard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As an elder, I oppose this effort.  I'm not about to go to a pharmacy and expose myself to sick people during a #pandemic. How would I even use that "discount card"? (Plus $200 is not enough for one month's meds.)  Stop using taxpayer $ for Trump's campaign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Typical Trump.  Remember every time he's blamed someone or some group for some imagined ill (e.g., immigrants, caravans)?  He's thrived on false claims, lies, and stoking fears of ghosts and goblins--while ignoring real threats, like #ClimateChange and #COVID19.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The FBI has been warning ab. #militias for a while.  Let's clarify: "Militias" are gangs, not some sort of admirable gun-rights groups. And when they plot to violently overthrow a duly-elected government and kidnap a governor, they should definitely face legal consequences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What others must endure has no relevance to Trump.   He believes he's special, should be treated as such, &amp; rules for others don't apply to him.  He should be afforded every luxury + be catered to in all situations. It's as if he's a king-like figure in his own narcissistic mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump's reaction is typical of a narcissist.  Trump believes he should never be forced to endure anything he does not wish to experience. HE should make all decisions ab. an event. [Others should not even suggest what he doesn't like.] HE should always be the center of attention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Goldman Sachs  thinks @JoeBiden and a Democratic sweep in the election would be better for the #economy and #Jobs.

<|startoftext|>Trump hiding his actual health status (and reportedly requiring NDAs of physicians last year) shows a complete disregard for transparency.  Americans deserve to know whether the President is fit enough to serve. Lack of transparency suggests that he is not.  #TrumpIsNotWell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A #GOP Congressman has been shown to be trying to hide #COVID19 infections among his staff.  How many more government officials have been doing this--and risking public health and safety--just b/c they are Republicans?  What possible justification can anyone give for doing this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump and supporters brought this on themselves by flouting safety rules in Cleveland.  Now that Trump has #COVID19, it's understandable that everyone involved in producing a debate might have health &amp; safety concerns.  #PresidentialDebate   https://t.co/6VWwFkXCYj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some reasons Trump won't participate in a virtual debate:  -Afraid of town hall questions -No live audience = no adulation -Has to share air time w/Biden -Moderator might mute him if he keeps interrupting -Can't infect Biden &amp; his supporters w/#COVID19   #PresidentialDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last weekend, a pollster came to our door. He asked 3 questions (two ab. candidates), but other was  What is your biggest issue in the 2020 election? My answer: Democracy.  @SenMikeLee's tweet makes it clear that democracy's on the ballot. GOP has abandoned support for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Democracy is EXACTLY the point. It's how our liberty, peace and prosperity are secured.  Republicans don't believe that the people should have their voices heard.  #VoteThemAllOut2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the US, we only prosecute people for actual crimes.  Trump is asking for the DOJ to enact revenge on his political rivals b/c he's angry. Only dictators insist on such acts from their henchmen.  Government does not exist to give Trump "satisfaction". #VoteHimOut #TrumpMeltdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YIKES. Just b/c he doesn't think he's contagious does NOT mean he isn't.  CDC: "People who are severely ill with COVID-19 might need to stay home longer than 10 days and up to 20 days after symptoms first appeared."  #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We must ask this question every single day even though we may never know the answer. Here's Trump talking to Bob Woodward on Feb. 7, yet he lied to ordinary Americans ab. #COVID19.  https://t.co/ENTTOTPOTz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pence just cannot level with the American people. Just like Trump.  https://t.co/BQORlE3aTX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don‚Äôt even try to say this administration has not failed.  Over 200,000 dead. Over 7 million infected. Countless with long term impacts to their health. And Trump‚Äôs DOJ is about to argue at #SCOTUS that millions should lose their healthcare.   #TrumpFailedAmerica #PenceFailed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pence did look sick: Sweaty, with bloodshot eyes.  Kept wondering if he was coming down with #COVID19.  #VPDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we will recall the historic nature of @SenKamalaHarris's performance in the #VPDebate tonight.  She managed the challenges with grace and grit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe men will forget the #VPDebate by the weekend, but many women will remember what Brian Williams called "Pence-splaining"--b/c women experience that kind of interruption, questioning, and rule-breaking from men regularly in our ordinary lives.  Also Pence is a smarmy liar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@NicolleDWallace said Pence "looked limp and lame" -- not Presidential.  #VPDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WHY did Karen Pence take off her mask? @DouglasEmhoff kept his on.  Particularly concerning since both she and her husband were exposed to #COVID19 at events at the toxic White House.  #VPDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mike Pence actually said this about Trump:  "This is a President that respects and cherishes all of the American people."  BIGGEST LIE OF THE NIGHT  #VPDebate #VPDebate2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly.  #VPDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pence's conduct toward these women is downright insulting to all women.  #VPDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I refuse to watch another debate until the Commission on Presidential Debates allows the moderator to take control of the candidates' time if they're abusing rules.  Pence is repeatedly defying the rules and there are no consequences.  #VPDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Microphones should be muted once a candidate goes 15 seconds over time.  Listening to Pence repeatedly go overtime without consequence is...irritating.  #VPDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pence is not entitled to his own lies, with which he is misleading Americans.  #VPDebate #VPDebate2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whose economic approach would be better?  Democrats' "unified control of Washington", according to Goldman Sachs. #VPDebate2020 #VPDebate   https://t.co/RXdxOL7YLs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WHEN will Sen. Harris get a chance to speak without interruption from her challenger?  #VPDebate2020 #VPDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I keep laughing out loud literally whenever Pence makes claims, because they're so blatantly false.  #VPDebate2020 #VPDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump did not "turn this economy around".  Again lies.  #VPDebate2020 #VPDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump has not been transparent about his health.  Pence is entirely dodging the question about Presidential or Vice-Presidential health.  #VPDebate #VPDebate2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Trump said, "We have Regeneron."  That's the name of the company, which made the monoclonal antibodies he was given.  That treatment was experimental, only given to a very small number of patients (study: 275 patients).  Most Americans could not get this.   https://t.co/lJGrmQ8L1i<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And I can't stop thinking about it either.  #TrumpIsNotWell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúdoctor‚Äù keeps showing how stupid this administration thinks the public is.   Even I know that this is a ‚Äòsmoke and mirrors‚Äô missive. And I‚Äôm not a physician.  This is not transparency. It‚Äôs public relations. And terrible PR at that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sure: ‚ÄúInadvertently‚Äù.  Barr‚Äôs DOJ keeps undermining its credibility.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>ON Trump's conduct:  "Nearly 1/3 of hospitalized #COVID19 patients experienced some type of altered mental function‚Äîranging from confusion to delirium to unresponsiveness‚Äîin the largest study to date of neurological symptoms among coronavirus patients..."  https://t.co/v5kyDyfVJJ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If Trump was infected on Sat., Sept. 26, EVERYONE he's come in contact with since then should be in quarantine for 14 days.

<|startoftext|>The fact that Trump wants his staff to work in full hazmat gear while he is still contagious is further evidence that Trump is not of sound mind. His decision-making is impaired.  Until he recovers, Pence should be in charge.  #TrumpIsNotWell  https://t.co/opdDXamCsI<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Why is it so hard for Republicans to say:  "Made a mistake. Learned from it. Won't do THAT again." when it comes to Trump.  He's unstable and now, with this illness and its medications, entirely unpredictable and reactive. He shouldn't be in charge. #TrumpIsNotWell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These seats are WAY too close to each other.  Pence, the head of the #coronavirus task force, should know that people can be asymptomatic (or pre-symptomatic) and infect others.

<|startoftext|>‚ÄúAfter all that America has accomplished, after all the years we have stood as a beacon of light to the world, it cannot be that here and now, in 2020, we will allow government of the people, by the people, and for the people to perish from this earth.‚Äù ‚Äî @JoeBiden at Gettysburg<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Cannot be stressed enough. Quarantine even if you test negative and/or have no symptoms, b/c the #COVID19  incubation period is 2-14 days. Listen to the doctor:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Checked my voter registration online. Was not registered.  Went to the early voting polling place. And I was on their rolls.  Not sure what happened but I was grateful my name was there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. This thread.  Trump held multiple super-spreader events (no masks, no social distancing) over the past 10 days.   And they refused to do contact tracing.  #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every day there are more cases of #COVID19 in this administration. Why can‚Äôt they follow public health advice??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unbelievable.  This administration has zero credibility.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After living in the same community, and voting in all elections, for many decades (most of my adult life, in fact), somehow it appears that I am NOT registered to vote.  Check your voter registration, everyone. #VOTE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>McConnell's play:  He knows Republicans are likely to lose in November, so he wants Democrats to be saddled with the failing economy he and Trump engineered.  What Republicans do every time they have power: Destroy the economy and then hand it over to Democrats to save. SMDH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even the Fed thinks we need an economic relief bill.  The House passed one in May. McConnell's been ignoring it ever since.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More people in Trump's orbit test positive for #COVID19.  Proof (again) that this administration does not "have the virus under control", as they love to propagandize.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Majorities want action on a relief bill before hearings on a #SCOTUS nominee--except for Mitch McConnell.  "Eighty-eight percent of Democrats, 77 percent of independents and 55 percent of Republicans were in favor of the Senate passing another stimulus package first."<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wishing ALL Democrats avoiding in-person contact w/Republicans under the circumstances.  WH is a toxic zone. Anyone--including the VP--who has had contact w/Trump and is not quarantining is a risk.  The Senate is a toxic zone as well, w/at least 3 Senators positive for #COVID19.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Asthmatics know these signals; breathing like this w/asthma--we'd need to go to the ER. (Read the short thread)  Trump's behaving irresponsibly again. Do not take his advice regarding #COVID19. Believe doctors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last flu season 22,000 died from it.  This year, in a matter of months, &gt;210,000 have died from #COVID19.  That‚Äôs almost &gt;10 times more&lt; than died from the last flu outbreak.  As usual, Trump exaggerates to propagandize Americans to fit his wishful thinking. #TrumpLies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People with asthma recognize this breathing pattern instantly, as I did (I too have asthma).   This is when you‚Äôre asking yourself if you should be on your way to the ER.

<|startoftext|>@katiecouric @realDonaldTrump Actively avoided turning on the TV b/c I knew the networks could not resist showing his departure live. Leaving a hospital simply isn't breaking news.  Giving him that attention is an in-kind campaign contribution, and should be condemned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Most people with coronavirus who have symptoms will no longer be contagious by 10 days after symptoms resolve."  Trump is likely still contagious.  #TrumpHasCovid   https://t.co/dYqCMcMdKR.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Umm... Very sobering.  #COVID19 can be unpredictable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Umm...   https://t.co/39yls3C1hr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whatever Trump does or says, it's all for show.  He's still not well. Anyone who's had #COVID19 and had more than a mild case (as Trump has) would know that he's still not well. But he'll pretend to be to "prove" how "strong" he is. This is a con-man's play.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>üö®ALERT:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clear from today's reports ab. Trump + #Republicans that have #COVID19 that these people simply do not care ab. others--they're willing to walk around contagious and infect those they come in contact with.  We can't trust them to keep us safe. #VoteThemAllOut2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOVE this. Thanks, @JoeBiden.  #BidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At this point, why shouldn't we use the word "deplorable" to describe Trump and his Republican enablers?  Anyone who would get a deadly infectious disease, willfully hide it, and thereby infect others, should be called deplorable--or worse.  #TrumpCovid19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are they afraid that they might then know how many people were positive and that might "look bad" for Trump?  Because that's the likely explanation for such irresponsible conduct--a cover-up for their culpability.  #TrumpCovid19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When the Executive Branch has lost ALL credibility:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>During the 2019-2020 influenza season, CDC estimates that influenza was associated with 22,000 deaths.  During 8 months of 2020, #COVID19 was responsible for at least 214,000 deaths.  That is nearly a 10-fold difference.  No, #coronavirus is not "just like flu".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, the logic of their claim seems flawed.  #TrumpHasCovid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TRUMP MAY STILL BE CONTAGIOUS. His staff is positive and contagious.  We do not know his condition. He is likely discharging against medical advice. Utterly irresponsible.  Do not believe the claims of a congenital liar. #TrumpHasCovid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Covering up this administration's positive #COVID19 tests will not protect--or help--anyone.  Full transparency is required.  #TrumpCovid19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More people infected by Trump administration super-spreaders.  #COVID19   https://t.co/hfXejc8o2o<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The WH is a toxic workplace.  And it's unsafe for everyone who must work there. Employees should get hazard pay.  #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As someone who's been learning to draw during the #COVID19 #pandemic, I found this feature wonderfully refreshing.  Creativity during crisis works wonders for my mental health. Guess I'm not alone in that.  #VisualArt #sketching #Music  https://t.co/7zs8650Y4t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WELL, here's one law Congress should consider once Democrats are in power.  If our government has **no duty to care** and **no duty to protect**, why have a government?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Epidemiologist notes that you can be infected and still test negative. Testing negative is NOT a #COVID19  shield.  Thread.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I prefer Presidents who aren't so reckless, and who aren't super-spreaders of a deadly virus.  [The bravado of this comment by Perrine reaches a new level of absurdity by the Trump administration.]<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #COVIDCascade of those Trump exposed to the virus will continue.  How much we know about it, and how many were infected as a result of the recklessness, stubbornness,  bravado, and willing ignorance of this administration, remains to be seen.  WH is now an unsafe place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That there are NOT medical reporters in these briefings is a media failure.  Americans deserve to know the health of the incumbent President. We are voting RIGHT NOW.  #TrumpHasCovid  #TrumpCovid19  #journalism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I were @KamalaHarris, I would be communicating with the debate commission.  The Commission on Presidential Debates should reconsider the timing of the debate and the venue, for the safety of candidates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ALSO:  VP Mike #Pence should be in quarantine.  WTH is he thinking???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please remember:  Exposure to someone positive for #COVID19 means you must quarantine for 14 days b/c the &gt;incubation time is 2-14 days&lt;.  If you don't quarantine, you could be unknowingly spreading the virus to others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As I said, irresponsible, placing so many at risk.  McEnany should have been quarantining after her exposure to Hicks and Trump. Instead, here she is, removing her mask.   https://t.co/PBmD8NJXE6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The President's closest advisors have been irresponsible. And they've risked the lives of innocent reporters just doing their jobs to inform the American people.  McEnany should resign.  #VoteHimOut  #VoteBidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I won't feel better until the inauguration of a President who believes in our democratic republic and our Constitution and the complete transfer of power.  Until all Trump enablers have left office, I worry that this country will remain at risk. #VoteHimOut  #VoteBidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We don't even know whether Trump himself tweeted these. His comms team occasionally tweets for him, and they could be doing it.  Trump's health today is so far unknown.  #COVID19 is an "up-and-down" illness; he may be better or worse. We have no truthful report. #TrumpCovid19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Utterly overwhelming. Read the history.  "Even by the warped standards of the Trump era, the past few weeks have been an unusually exhausting blur, culminating in the shocking yet not entirely surprising news that the president has #COVID19."  https://t.co/LG3FwU3OAq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent analysis.  Trump began a #propaganda campaign to undermine the most sacred act in a democratic society--voting.  Then many in the #media (notably Fox + WSJ, yet including @washingtonpost , @CNN, &amp; @nytimes ) followed his lead, like sheep.  Will there be a reckoning?  https://t.co/CLTw0SHGK5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously, the Trump administration in its entirety needs to be removed from office. They're recklessly endangering the health and safety of the entire population.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Even as Trump himself comes face to face with possible death at the hands of a disease he downplayed for so long, he‚Äôs still demonstrating the same depraved dereliction of duty that he has all throughout, helping to kill more than 200,000 Americans."   https://t.co/QXjnHNK2mg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This news cycle keeps us from focusing on all the horrors introduced by Trump's administration.  Remember this one? We need to know what they're doing to stop these barbaric practices.  #Immigration #hysterectomies #privateprisons<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump's DOJ is arguing in the Supreme Court to invalidate  #Obamacare (aka #ACA), which already protects pre-existing conditions.  Trump doesn't want to admit that he's working to make it harder for us to have #healthcare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me, too.  I also want a President who behaves prudently and does not put the lives of those who protect him in danger due to his recklessness.  #TrumpHasCovid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dang it. Autocorrect again. *incompetent not *incompetence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have a man-child in charge of our government, constantly needing entertainment and unable to control himself.  Let's not try to be so charitable ab. Trump any more. He keeps proving how incompetence and #UnfitToBePresident he is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IOW, Trump took an unnecessary absurd #COVID19 drive, exposing innocent people at work to his virus, just for theater, against physician recommendations.  #TrumpIsUnwell #TrumpIsUnfitForOffice   https://t.co/SfPcei2Z4o<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/fKGxNP7KH1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump is playing President as if he's in a TV show. This absurd drive to "greet supporters" is medically reckless and uncalled for. To him, it's all show.  We need a real President. Trump is just too irresponsible to be that person. He is #UnfitToBePresident.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump is so desperate to prove that he's a "fighter" who can "beat #COVID19", and so desperate to control press coverage, that he put the lives of hospital staff and his own staff in danger of contracting the virus -- just for another photo op.  This man is seriously #unfit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Risking the continuity of government for a political event? He should be quarantining, not traveling, as anyone exposed to #COVID19 should be.  VP #Pence is just as irresponsible as his President.   #TrumpCovid19 #PenceQuarantine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ALERT:  We're in the middle of an election. People are voting right now. Voters have a right to know if the incumbent candidate is healthy and can serve.  Stop the "happy talk". Stop lying. Get real. Level with the American people. We can take it.  #TrumpCovid19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent thread by an infectious disease specialist on Trump's #COVID19 diagnosis and treatment. Scroll to the top.  But these are the salient outstanding questions:  #TrumpCovid19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The longest news week in recent history...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The empty chair.  To all who mourn, we send our deepest condolences. May memories bless you and your families, and may remembrance comfort all those who survive.   #COVIDDayofRemembrance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing has made me smile more this morning than viewing the numerous posts by gay men (and allies) under the hashtag #ProudBoys.  Thank you for all the messages, photos, and videos. Definitely a day-brightener.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We want a President who does not lie to us when he's taken to a hospital.  What we've heard from Trump &amp; his doctors since Friday is an appalling lack of transparency.  We're less than a month from an election. Voters deserve to know ab. Trump's health.  #TrumpCovid #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder: How many of the Trump coterie are hiding their diagnoses and hoping they can pretend they never had #COVID19 or that they had it and it was "no big deal"? They're terrified of 'bad news'.  This administration doesn't see an opportunity when it's staring at them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚ÄúThere was a panic before this started, but now we‚Äôre sort of the stupid party,‚Äù said Edward J. Rollins, co-chairman of the pro-Trump super PAC Great America.  COVID doesn't care if you "believe" in it or science. So, it is stupid not to take precautions.  https://t.co/lLRjAkj1OR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn autocorrect. Conley not Conkey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chair of UCSF Dept. of Medicine‚Äôs interpretation of Dr. Conkey‚Äôs press conference.   Trump is not doing as well as he wants us to believe.   #TrumpCovid19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚Äú...came off that we were trying to hide something, which wasn‚Äôt necessarily true...‚Äù ‚ÄîDr. Conley  ‚ÄúNecessarily‚Äù really concerned me here.   They‚Äôre very likely hiding information Americans deserve to know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amen.   O‚ÄôBrien was simply embarrassing this morning. May as well just say they‚Äôre letting Russia have free rein. SMDH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Again, guaranteed that Trump is demanding to be released against medical advice while still contagious.   Yet another indication of his complete irresponsibility relative to his position and his stewardship of the nation during this #pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>See?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IOW, Trump would not be receiving dexamethasone if he had a ‚Äúmild‚Äù case of #COVID19.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Conley‚Äôs lost credibility.  This should be disqualifying for a physician to the President.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guaranteed that Trump is demanding to be released against medical advice. He doesn‚Äôt like the coverage, doesn‚Äôt like the optics, and longs to control the message. He wants to project an image that he‚Äôs ‚Äútoo strong for the virus‚Äù, even though he cannot control the illness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dexamethasone treatment in hospitalized patients w/#COVID19 helps those needing oxygen or mechanical ventilation, according to this article from a July study.   https://t.co/pJgbbawMty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jake Tapper says what so many of us are thinking.   #COVID19  #TrumpHasCovid  #WearAMask<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Senior here.  -Trump has promised to eliminate #SocialSecurity and threatened #Medicare.  -Trump‚Äôs mismanagement of the #COVID19 #pandemic threatens our lives. -Trump‚Äôs performance at the debate proved his intemperance. -His lying lost our trust.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's @SNL! Cold open.  Alec Baldwin vs Jim Carey!  #SNLPremiere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Important to make clear:  Testing negative for #COVID19 today does NOT mean a person won't test positive tomorrow.  Testing isn't protection. Masking, social distancing, hand washing, and quarantine when necessary are considered relatively protective. Emphasis on "relatively".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nuzzi's tweet is an understatement.  -&gt;Trump + WH staff failed to inform those in the direct line of succession &amp; the Gang of 8 ab. the President's health.  Officals have lost the confidence and trust of Americans everywhere, and regaining it will be a Herculean effort.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a minor question.  Our allies and adversaries are asking the question too.  Trump's illness is a national security issue, and Americans deserve to know who's in charge of their government at every juncture.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the only conclusion we can come to after the events of the past week or so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This level of irresponsibility has to be called out by the press.  Anyone--and I mean Pence--who has been in close contact w/someone diagnosed w/#COVID19 should be in quarantine for 14 days afterwards.  He should NOT be potentially spreading the virus or causing others to get it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do ALL in Trump's COVID Circle have a death wish? Do they *plan* to be virus vectors?  Barr's behavior puts everyone he comes in contact with at risk--b/c he was at the Rose Garden ceremony last Friday with a host of people who are now positive for #COVID19.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is NOT transparency.  #TrumpCovid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hiding info from Americans has always been their policy.  We cannot know for sure what is actually happening w/Trump's illness unless an independent party provides updates.  Trump + WH are completely unreliable and untrustworthy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happening today: Doctors contradicted the WH spokespeople ab. timing of Trump's diagnosis, using the phrase "We're 72 hours into this illness...", which means Trump was tested earlier than he said.  WH + Trump lost all credibility long ago. Lost trust is hard to regain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Article that updates the list of those in Trump's orbit and whether they've tested positive for #COVID19:   https://t.co/leoiZIO66g<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Partial list, no doubt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Pences need PCR tests. Then tests for several days afterwards.   And anyone in contact with ant WH staff who tests positive must quarantine.  The plan that Pence will travel &amp; debate next week should be altered since he should be quarantined (if he respected medical advice).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How many more in Trump‚Äôs orbit will be diagnosed?  If people weren‚Äôt convinced that this #pandemic is ongoing, all of the infections derived from the White House spread should help persuade.   #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"The president deserves our sympathy and best wishes for a speedy recovery ‚Äî but he cannot, and will not, escape judgment for his failure to treat the coronavirus with the gravity and urgency that it deserves."  Agree.  #COVID19  #TrumpHasCovid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Umm. This is not good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This...and so many others.  Putting people at risk of a disease that's life-threatening--when he knew how serious it was--makes me very angry.  That he has it now is not comforting or ironic. It's predictable and a national crisis. #COVID19    https://t.co/fQhc1SHaIk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same.  I don't wish anyone ill.   But...That's why I'm angry. Trump callously mismanaged and ignored the seriousness of this virus. Now the country is in crisis. I've been angry all day.  #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@ABCPolitics reporting that Trump will be taken to Walter Reed "out of an abundance of caution".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good grief. Now physicians are covering for these people.  Everyone in contact w/someone diagnosed w/#COVID19 must quarantine and be tested. That's standard practice. SMDH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Judge #Barrett was said to have recovered from #COVID19 during the summer. That doesn't lessen her risk.  Antibodies from the virus wane, and some people have been known to be re-infected. Unless she is re-tested during a 14-day period, she cannot know for sure she hasn't been.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Today's Lesson:  Ignore science and medical advice at your peril.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As I was saying:  "This is a code red moment for the US government, on multiple levels.

It could cripple the US government." #COVID19   https://t.co/sW8k60Ipzt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More on the sheer number of those exposed to #COVID19 due to the White House's wishful thinking that the #pandemic was waning.  Trump + Melania + Hope Hicks + Ronna McDaniel + Sen. Lee ... so far.  Exposed: Everyone in contact w/any of them.   https://t.co/99wNUlSAaI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently Republicans in pursuit of power will risk the lives of anyone in their circles just to get an outcome they want.  McConnell's insistence on holding hearings after a member of the Judiciary Committee tested positive for #COVID19 is irresponsible at best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The irresponsibility and lack of concern for himself (as President) and for others isn't surprising.  This is who Trump is. And he's exposed dozens of top government officials to #COVID19 in his recklessness.  Cannot get over how careless he's been, for himself and the nation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone, please note: #COVID19 #testing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sen. Lee announced he is positive for the virus.  &gt;Anyone&lt; in contact w/him needs to quarantine. Like all these people at the Rose Garden ceremony at which Amy Coney Barrett was nominated.  Starting to look like a #COVID19 "cluster": Lee, Hicks, McDaniel, Barrett, Melania, Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even if Bidens are negative today, they will still need to be tested regularly during the next several days.  The incubation period for #COVID19 is 2-14 days!!  #pandemic<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Anyone w/contact w/White House officials should consider quarantine.  And that means Senators too.  #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The sheer number of government officials who could be at risk for #COVID19 b/c of their contact w/White House officials is staggering--and the level at which they all operated--and could hobble our government.  That's why I'm horrified and angry w/Trump this morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tribelaw I'm afraid not. Trump's "I don't take responsibility at all" comment placed him in line for criticism. Now he's placed nation's security at risk thru flouting scientific &amp; medical advice + failure to implement a complete #pandemic plan.  Tell this to 200,000 mourning families.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here's his Chief of Staff, flouting masking...as if he's got a bubble around him...as if he won't be testing positive tomorrow.  Trump's administration is positively useless in fighting a #pandemic.   https://t.co/MgXTEGeHbD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gloves should NOT be off on Trump's diagnosis of #COVID19. Yes, we're sorry he's sick.  But he's sick b/c he refused to take responsibility for managing this #pandemic that has killed &gt;200K Americans. And now he's put the nation's security at risk as well.  Just hopping mad here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry that Trump, Melania, Hope Hicks, and Ronna McDaniel all have #COVID19. Wish them all a full recovery.  But we cannot ignore the fact that this did not have to happen.  Trump's bungled response to the #pandemic has led to this unfortunate outcome--a national security issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet another instance of Trump's irresponsibility and lack of concern for others.  #VoteHimOut2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Because Trump lies about all things, and is a con-man, when he announces that he has #COVID19, it's no surprise that some people might not believe him.  If he has the virus, when he recovers, let's hope he finally decides to manage the #pandemic for the country.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Republicans still want the lawsuit to invalidate #Obamacare (aka #ACA) to go forward.  The Senate voted to ask the DOJ to abandon the lawsuit, but 43 Republicans would not vote to do so, even though Obamcare protects pre-existing conditions--and #COVID19 will become one of those.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In a "debate" prior to a Presidential election, in which Americans expected to hear what the candidates would do with and for their nation, the incumbent President lied and conducted himself like an out-of-control thug, verbally assaulting his opponent and calling gangs to arms.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This sentence from @FrankBruni's column today really stuck with me:  "To be Trump is to be accustomed to an unjust world unimpressed with your majesty."

<|startoftext|>Still upset after tonight's #PresidentialDebate. @NicolleDWallace was right: We watched 1.5 hrs. of abuse by our President--of the opponent, of the moderator, of the rules, of the country.  The US was abused by Trump's pathologies.  #PresidentialDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously, @washingtonpost and @nytimes?  I mean, doing "bothsides" in another election year after what we watched tonight? Appalled.  This was a debate that even historians could not believe. And your coverage shows how ill-prepared your #journalism is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Future debates should be canceled.  There is no reason to put the country thru another experience like tonight.  #PresidentialDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many states have laws against "poll watching" b/c it's considered voter intimidation.  #PresidentialDebate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Trump's claim that "there has never been a President who has done more" is absolutely a lie.  Trump's bragging by using lies is beyond tiresome. It's disgraceful for a President.  #PresidentialDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Telling moment in a horrible "debate".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can hardly stand listening to Trump. The way he's conducting himself in this debate should show everyone what a bully he is.  MAKE IT STOP.  #PresidentialDebate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>After tonight, there's no reason to watch another debate.  One candidate is a narcissistic bully who interrupts, lies, brags, and works to dominate. The other candidate can hardly tell America what he plans to do. The moderator cannot control the event.  #PresidentialDebate2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're muttering "Stop interrupting" here at home.  So far this "debate" is hardly worth the nation's time.  #PresidentialDebate2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Agree wholeheartedly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WHY should Chris Wallace agree to that?  It's a simple fact, something that happened while Trump was President. Hiding facts from Americans seems to be standard operating procedure for the Trump administration. And voters deserve to know that.  #Debates2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The country deserves to know this. Trump's debt makes him a national security risk.  Few, if any, Americans know what kind of risk Trump poses to the country b/c of his debt. Who has leverage over him? Could it be foreign nations or entities?  #TrumpTaxes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When asked about the @nytimes story ab. #TrumpTaxes tomorrow, #Republican #Senators will no doubt say that they haven't seen it, or heard ab. it, and thus they cannot comment.

<|startoftext|>On Trump‚Äôs confidence that #Obamacare will be struck down:  IF he does anything at all on #healthcare, which is doubtful b/c of his record w/#COVID19, Trump will likely allow healthcare companies to dictate your healthcare options, including not covering pre-existing conditions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump‚Äôs been claiming he has a better healthcare plan for years.   It‚Äôs vapor. If he had one, he‚Äôd be showing it off.   Put up or shut up. #TrumpLies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well...Hmm.  Thread.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And those who want theocratic rule ought to consider whether they'd be comfortable with someone else's religion guiding US law and policy.  The Constitution protects us &gt;from&lt; religious persecution--by all, for all. It's not to be used to install religious persecution. #1A<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's an example of Trump using religion to persecute someone from the other party, yet conservatives remain silent about that.  Principles serve as foundations of a value system; this shows that when some conservatives make claims, they're unprincipled.   https://t.co/uDxgRBDOUu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hayes hits on a key point: Conservatives keep claiming they are persecuted. Why? Because people challenge their assertions.  Mature people know they need to have the capacity to persuade others of their perspectives, with evidence. Today's conservatives find that too burdensome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #COVID19 #pandemic is not over, even tho people seem to think so and many are ignoring public safety rules. Cases increased throughout the summer, then settled down for a while.

<|startoftext|>This guy is paranoid. He keeps claiming all sorts of people are "out to get Trump", without evidence--as if it's true.  He's also a delusional narcissist.

<|startoftext|>Trump's using propaganda -- false claims intended to influence people to his desired ends -- to both intimidate people and keep them from voting and to influence public opinion against the idea of free and fair elections.  No President has made such a pointed attack on democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, 2016 was bad. 2020 is worse: Democracy has been challenged by a wannabe dictator President, with the help of foreign interference. We're watching our country be attacked by a self-entitled minority party, intent on destroying the republic. "Angry" isn't a strong enough word.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump tries to bribe seniors for their votes, by claiming to issue a $200 prescription drug card; unknown if he has the authority.   Insulting that he thinks he can buy votes.   Trump‚Äôs nothing but a con man and grifter.  #TrumpMustGo  #Vote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're a senior, or worry ab. your parents or grandparents' futures, this thread is for you.  Trump + McConnell have been planning, since their Trump Tax Scam, to cut or eliminate #SocialSecurity and #Medicare.  If Trump is re-elected, that will likely happen. Read:<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>USA's 7-day moving average of #COVID19 cases is 41,105. That's per day.   If we averaged that number for a year, we'd have an additional 15M cases. (Today we have 7M.)  And those are *diagnosed cases*. We don't know how many have been undiagnosed or asymptomatic.  #pandemic  https://t.co/IrlcebAv33<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just as we thought.  "The CIA assessment described Derkach‚Äôs efforts in detail and said that his activities have included working through lobbyists, members of Congress and U.S. media organizations..."  Reminder: Foreign interference in US elections is illegal.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MMcHarry Lines are definitely a thing here. Nov., 2008 I waited for 2 hrs. on Election Day.  But early voting is usually not crowded, especially since they expanded polling places.

<|startoftext|>Under Obama/Biden, I never woke up and thought:  "Is this the last time I will vote in a free and fair election?" "Which allies have we abandoned now?"

<|startoftext|>Trump didn‚Äôt want &gt;the stock market&lt; to panic.  He doesn‚Äôt care about ordinary people. He was thinking about his investments and those of the people he cares about‚Äîfamily, friends, donors, the wealthy. Everyone else is meaningless to him.  Isn‚Äôt that clear from all he‚Äôs done?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This thread.  #TrumpKnew  #TrumpLiedPeopleDied  #TrumpResignNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beyond furious that #TrumpKnew and minimized risks regarding #COVID19.  It's a betrayal of his oath to protect Americans.  #TrumpFailedAmerica  #TrumpResignNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So now the Press Secretary is knowingly lying to the American people.  This entire administration should be fired. Immediately. #TrumpResignNow #TrumpMustGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The tragedy of  Woodward‚Äôs book is that he hoarded the knowledge that #TrumpKnew while people died.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the most laughable nomination I‚Äôve ever read about in my lifetime.   Trump abandoned our allies, the Kurds. He should not be honored for anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don‚Äôt let anyone claim otherwise.   #TrumpKnew, and is responsible. And he doesn‚Äôt care that thousands died and millions contracted #COVID19 because he minimized the risks‚Äîon purpose. Who knows what long-term effects survivors will have?  Unconscionable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cowards.   They are all cowards without the integrity to serve the American people.   #VoteThemAllOut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TrumpKnew and he didn‚Äôt care if Americans died from #COVID19. He downplayed the risks so people would continue to work, go to school, socialize, because he was afraid an economic downturn would affect his re-election. He is the most selfish President we‚Äôve ever had. #TrumpResign<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And he downplayed it on purpose, leading to the loss of thousands of Americans‚Äô lives.  #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good grief. He knew. He understood that #COVID19 wasn‚Äôt comparable to flu. And yet he did little to contain it.   Trump‚Äôs responsible for the spread, since he failed to act and actively downplayed its significance.  Neglect, malfeasance‚Äîcall it what you will #TrumpFailedAmerica.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Children get #COVID19.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could not agree more. Tying healthcare to employment makes employees vulnerable to the whims of employers and potentially limits what conditions may be covered (as we saw with the Hobby Lobby case).  Time to decouple healthcare from employment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, conservatives: You're not being 'canceled'.  [Of course you knew that grievance was a propaganda ploy.]<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's an uninformed opinion.  From #COVID19: -college football player, age 20, died from complications -children can get multi-system inflammatory syndrome -in Italy, only ~50% of survivors have recovered -survivors report longer-term multi-system impacts  #coronavirus isn't flu.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>250,000 #COVID19 cases!  Imagine the: -possible longer-term #coronavirus complications on all those infected -impact on their families and communities -impact on healthcare providers &amp; facilities  Please consider when/if you're planning to attend large gatherings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still cannot get over this. Trump co-opted McCain's bill...while calling our military 'losers' and 'suckers'.  Trump is a liar and a cheat, lacking all integrity.  As my dad, a vet and Purple Heart recipient, would say, he's beneath contempt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shocking and highly disturbing to this citizen as well.  Trump+Barr are wielding the power of government on Trump's &gt;personal&lt; behalf, to shut down a valid lawsuit.  Both should be removed from office immediately for this naked attempt to undermine the rule of law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About 50% of Italy‚Äôs #COVID19 survivors have not recovered.   This is no joke. We don‚Äôt yet know what the long term implications are of contracting #coronavirus.  Calling for herd immunity is simply irresponsible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Inexplicable. Peaceful protestors exercising their 1A rights are also not gangs. And yet far too many call them that, or thugs or...[derogatory term here].  However, both the @fbi and @splc identified white nationalist armed militias as domestic terror threats.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>For those who serve, and for veterans and military families, who may not believe the story about Trump published today, this thread lists many times Trump has disrespected those who have served.   Many published reports listed.   This is who Trump is.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>IL @SenDuckworth served admirably in our military. This household is more than proud to have her serve with dignity, honor, and integrity in the US Senate.

<|startoftext|>Very impressed by @FacesOfCOVID.  These people lost their lives to the #COVID19 #pandemic that has been mismanaged by the Trump admin. They deserve to be remembered, especially during this time of social distancing.  Sincere condolences to the families &amp; friends of all victims.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump does not understand the military or believe in the American idea. He has no concept of self-sacrifice. And true patriotism is a foreign idea to him as well.  He is the actual loser--the man without a country I learned about in middle school many decades ago.  #LoserTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another clip from the article, which describes an attitude Trump holds towards our soldiers, veterans, and war dead that no President has ever expressed.  #LoserTrump  https://t.co/0uxQdQhvAF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump's attitude toward those who gave the ultimate sacrifice is beyond despicable.

<|startoftext|>Thread with sources.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our government has known about #coronavirus since the end of Jan. and for 7 months Trump has failed to put together a coherent national strategy to get it under control.  Instead, Trump ordered data to be suppressed, the CDC to equivocate on testing, and HHS to lie ab. treatment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Terrible justification.  The US government belongs to the people, not to a singular individual wielding power as autocrats do.  Ratcliffe should be subpoenaed and held in contempt if he fails to comply. Americans paid for the intelligence he's withholding. #Intelligence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are not "soldiers".  Our military are well-trained and swear allegiance to the country and the Constitution.  These people who take lives on the streets are thugs and vigilantes who swear fealty to a cult of personality--no different from gang members.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My 2 cents.  Pretending to protect when you‚Äôre just intimidating others with your weapons isn‚Äôt a militia; it‚Äôs a gang.  Might does not make right. Taking the law into your own hands isn‚Äôt justice. It‚Äôs violating the sacred rights of your fellow citizens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to our intelligence agencies, Russia is &gt;still interfering&lt; in US electoral processes.  And Trump welcomed that in 2016.

Heed this thread‚Äôs warnings. Trump must be defeated because he is an enemy of American democracy.  #BidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wants another term to do what?   Not an agenda. Not even a coherent statement.  #TrumpFailedAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tonight we watched "Hidden Figures" again.  Always cry over 60s racial segregation (the America I grew up in). To think  these incredible women gave their intelligence and dedication to NASA while white America judged them for the color of their skin. Cry now for today's horrors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And nobody laughed uncontrollably?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Liars in the #GOP continue to lie to the American people.  Because that‚Äôs what they do. Every day.   #TrumpLies #RepublicansLie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would have been unthinkable in any previous administration in my long lifetime.  But in Trump's America the administration + #GOP do not believe laws, rules, norms, or protocols should apply to them.   Yet another reason to VOTE THEM ALL OUT. #BidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Press freedom -- and freedom from persecution for reporting the actions of our government -- is a Constitutional right.  Trump's government should never target #journalists for doing their jobs. #PressFreedom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also happening in #TrumpsAmerica:  -#USPS slows down mail delivery -Federal government discourages #VoteByMail during a #pandemic  -USA leads the world in #COVID19 cases and deaths -Trump admin. bullies top public health org. to lie ab. the pandemic  No one wants more of this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Before #Trump starts blaming #Biden for violence in the streets (b/c you know he will tonight), a couple of facts:  -Biden called Jacob Blake's family -Biden condemned  "needless violence" in Kenosha  &gt;Biden did not cause extrajudicial shootings. Period.&lt;  https://t.co/qawxXAjreW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IOW, Fahrenthold got it right.  Trump's administration is filled with #Grifters, and Trump is the Grifter-in-Chief who shows them all how it's done.  It's no secret that the Trump family is barred from having a charitable foundation, from which they stole money, too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is an outrage to all Americans.  The President serves all the people, not just "his voters". We need a leader who believes that and acts like it.  #BidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump's America:  -10.2% unemployment -GDP down ~32% -180,000 dead from an uncontrolled #pandemic -civil unrest after police shootings -inadequate response to natural disasters  #GOP wants to blame Democrats and continue these disasters? They're responsible. #TrumpFailedAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the GOP like to play pretend that none of this is happening, praising their cult leader and failing to mention the ills that have led to divisiveness and violence were all encouraged by their dear leader.  Shocking levels of deception and lying. #TrumpLies #PenceLies<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Remember when Trump falsely claimed that children were "almost immune" to #COVID19?  Another lie from the Liar-in-Chief. #TrumpLies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's an effort to reduce confirmed #COVID19 cases, b/c the Trump administration wants the public to believe (FALSELY) that transmission is waning.  @CDCgov should be ashamed at capitulating to political pressure. Public health will suffer and they will be responsible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Outraged. @CDCgov has now been corrupted.

<|startoftext|>THIS WHOLE THREAD.  Thank you, @RepSpeier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't you think that the branch of government specifically charged with enforcing US law is brazenly breaking the #HatchAct and claiming that no one cares if the law is broken or enforced?  Trump administration, here's your heads up: &gt;No one is above the law. Crime is crime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The absurdity of omitting their culpability in how things are today.  Unemployment 10.2% #COVID19 deaths ~180,000  This administration is responsible for it. Give you 4 more years to use the GOP wrecking ball? No.  https://t.co/PhoRq8fpvw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Untrue, @MarkMeadows.  We live in central IL. And we are outraged ab. using the powers of government for political ends. We think the Hatch Act should be enforced. For ALLL persons using the levers of government for personal political advantage.  Enforce the #HatchAct. Today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why we don't watch the #RNCConvention2020:  "It was another tsunami of untruths on the second night of the Republican National Convention."  https://t.co/J9TUVv5zDF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been avoiding TV coverage and Twitter during the RNC. Being gaslit by grifters isn't a preferred activity in this household. But we're definitely outraged by this administration's abuse of power and nose-thumbing at the rule of law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump always chooses advisors with conflicts of interest. With this pick he's increasing risks to public health.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good question.  Why must Trump + supporters lie, mislead, exaggerate, and deceive about his record, his numbers, his statements, and his entire Presidency?  Why can't this administration live with the truth and level with the American people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Um...not trending downward.  The #COVID19  #pandemic is not over, and wishful thinking won't end it.  What is the Trump administration doing to help Americans stay safe? Nothing. Just this week Pence said they had their hopes up for "a miracle". Really.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, really:  #GOP has been trying to claim that &gt;the future administration&lt; will give you the ills that are happening under the current government.  Most insane claim from #RNCConvention2020 and the Trump administration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First: Ignore a pandemic and let seniors die. Second: Drain #SocialSecurity and let the remaining seniors starve.  What does the #GOP have against older Americans?  Is that how Trump plans to Make America Great?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The con man.  My parents and brother were in sales. I've heard all the "just think positively about your mark" pitches I ever want to hear again.  The idea that Pres. Trump &amp; Don Jr. have what America needs is, to speak kindly, malarkey. #BidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Since election day 2016, terror and sadness for the country have dominated my thoughts and emotions. Every single day.  So, sorry, Trump. These past almost 4 years have been some of the worst in my lifetime. Cannot wait for the nightmare to be over.  #TrumpFailedAmerica<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Keep thinking ab. how many people used our public library for computer and Internet access, and how those families have few educational opportunities as a result of virtual learning.  A Zoom outage doesn't affect kids who never had technology at home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And finally: The #GOP makes no statement of what they stand for--what philosophy or principles will guide their decision-making.  It's a decision to stand for an authoritarian dictator who will decide all for the party, and the country.  Shameful. Unworthy of American ideals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Admitting that the Republican Party has become a cult of personality and nothing more.  Just as bad: Admitting that they make no promises to Americans of why we should vote to give them power. The GOP will decide what our tax dollars should do for us. No thanks. #GOP #Republicans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@JoeBiden warned the nation. He saw the potential for a #pandemic and knew our government needed to be ready.   Yet Trump dismissed or downplayed the need for pandemic preparedness. That‚Äôs one reason the US leads the world in #COVID19 deaths.    https://t.co/N0rrfTzPMP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why did Trump fail to do most of these agenda items during his first term, because some of these were stated first term priorities? Why should we think he‚Äôd do them in a second term?  Trump ‚Äúachievements‚Äù seem slim from our perspective. Where‚Äôs that list? #TrumpFailedAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #BidenHarris2020 on @ABC right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Pompeo will use this convention to introduce himself to Americans as a potential 2024 candidate for President, his ultimate goal.  During my lifetime no other Secretary of State has spoken to a political convention while serving (and at least two have run for the Presidency).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sobering and chilling.  Trump is willing to let Americans be guinea pigs just so he can claim he's done something. But this is reckless, and scientifically unwarranted.  #COVID19  https://t.co/CT5Whhvh45<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scientists don't feel that data from the studies warrant the approval. But Trump will let them use the treatment anyway.  Trump's desperate to have anything, even unproven, to improve his #COVID19 record.  He's a hazard to public health &amp; safety.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Trump actually held intelligence briefings, maybe he'd know about it. (Or read his daily brief.)  Also, they could ask the FBI rather than rely on Google. We have intelligence agencies for a reason.  This administration is beyond incompetent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He has no authority to take any government action.  Wolf is in the job illegally. He needs to be removed.  https://t.co/Z0vDApM8G5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's your word for the 57% of Republicans who say these #COVID19 deaths are acceptable?  My words for them are heartless and irresponsible.  The first job of government is to protect citizens, from threats like foreign invasions and public health threats. #TrumpFailedAmerica<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If Trump has plans to revive the struggling economy, the public hasn‚Äôt heard ab. them. He doesn‚Äôt listen to experts.

<|startoftext|>Trump doesn't care if #COVID19 testing is safe. He doesn't care if your results are accurate.  He'll risk your ability to know if you or your family members have this virus b/c he thinks it'll help him get re-elected.  Bottom line: Trump is a threat to public health and safety.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump took away the FDA's ability to regulate #COVID19 tests--b/c he thinks it will affect his re-election!!  What it means: You may not know if the COVID test you take is reliable. The company won't have to prove that to the FDA.  Thread:  https://t.co/bsVmZfwkPQ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Great post-Roll Call graphic for @JoeBiden.  Not exactly convention-hall enthusiasm but I'm definitely applauding here at home.  #DemConvention  #DemocraticConvention2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you, #Utah delegation, for your pitch for #VoteByMail.  Your state is one of those who prove that voting by mail is safe, effective, and fair.  Let's offer it nationally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're getting to see all of the states and territories that make up our country, with all its splendid variety. What a treat!  LOVE this Roll Call of Delegates. Thanks to all who have spoken.  #DemConvention  #DemocraticConvention2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How to help #Iowa after last week's #derecho  Thanks for the reminder, Iowa Delegation.   https://t.co/nNTNGJWXA1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Roll Call of Delegates is much more interesting when each Chair "proudly casts its votes" with a background relevant to its state/territory.  Love it.  #DemConvention  #DemocraticConvention2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What a great opening: Newly elected Democrats who tell us what's important to them + why they ran for office.  As an elder who's watched many Democratic conventions, SO happy to see younger generations speaking for their constituents and for the country. Thanks. #DemConvention<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tuning in to tonight's #DemConvention.  Virtual applause as it opens.  Let's go.   #DemConvention2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even after DeJoy restores what he sabotaged, he could be prosecuted because undermining US Mail is a federal crime.  #USPSsabotage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Extremely important.  Free and fair elections are being undermined by Trump and his various henchmen. Don't believe DeJoy until he has restored what he sabotaged.  Defend democracy. Defend our rights. Thank you, AGs. #USPS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On this 100th anniversary of #VotesForWomen, may we recommend this documentary for your viewing pleasure?  Women definitely had to fight (for many years) to get the vote.  Watch the history. And never take your vote for granted.  #Suffrageat100   https://t.co/EhTTDJsXCM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No surprise:  Trump lied to Mueller. He knew ab., &amp; approved, the release of stolen info from Wikileaks thru Stone + Assange.  The only rational explanation:  #Conspiracy to work thru a foreign adversary to impact a US election + conspiracy to cover that up. Illegal.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Republicans apparently want to be the first to inquire ab. the #USPS changes during an election year in a pandemic. But all they're interested in are the financial requirements for #VoteByMail? Not the fact that these changes could impact an election?  Seriously?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Confirming everything Trump and associates lied about. Confirming what many suspected ab. the 2016 election.  #TrumpRussia #SSCIReport<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, this #DNC2020 keeps making me cry.  Did not expect that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you to all those who opened our virtual #DNC2020.  What a wonderful version of our National Anthem!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems scandalous to me that some public health departments have yet to receive federal funding for their efforts to fight #COVID19.  Trump's administration either doesn't know how to do this, or there are underlying "reasons" for these delays.  Thread.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Illinois: Early voting is available.  The early voting period runs from Thurs., Sept. 24, 2020 to  Mon., Nov. 2, 2020  Dates &amp; hours may vary based on where you live. Polling places may vary for early voting. Check your county clerk's office. #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This month I celebrated a low-key birthday. Every birthday feels like a gift after a certain age.  I feel fortunate to be alive during this horrifying pandemic. And I'm hoping to stay alive at least long enough to vote in Nov.  Hoping you stay healthy too. #Vote #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump‚Äôs America.   Is this what you want, citizens?  Elections have consequences indeed.   #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #USPS is NOT a business. It is a government service, provided to all Americans. And it is Constitutionally mandated.  Supporting it financially is the same as supporting military, border control, justice, foreign service, intelligence--all functions of our government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Concur.  These #GOP Senators and Trump sycophants appear to be enemies of #democracy itself. They don't care if their party cheats (with our adversaries!) to win.  Vote them out or we may never have free and fair elections again. It is that dire.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meadows' tactic is a typical disinformation ploy.  "Extensive research reveals that fraud is very rare. Yet repeated, false allegations of fraud can make it harder for millions of eligible Americans to participate in elections."--Brennan Center #USPS    https://t.co/K4d2k86gdm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interfering with elections and Americans' sovereign right to vote, a bedrock of our democracy, by hobbling #USPS seems impeachable. The sheer amount of disorder &amp; disaster Trump can visit on the country &amp; the world from now to Jan. 21 warrants consideration of a 2nd #impeachment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have been saying this to everyone who will listen.  It's wrong to imagine that we can cut off funding to a public service we depend on and then expect the everything we've become accustomed to getting from it.  #USPS deserves taxpayer support. And #DeJoyMustGo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In an election year, during a pandemic, Trump appointee, Louis DeJoy, PLANNED to reduce mail delivery and remove mail sorting machines across the country, slowing election ballot + prescription deliveries, bills &amp; payments, &amp; #SocialSecurity checks. #USPS   https://t.co/ZMk13PMgbe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wondered ab. this myself.  Now that every aspect of government has been politicized, it would not be surprising to find out that even mail delivery now depends on whether your district or city voted for You Know Who.  [Disgusting to even have to consider the possibility.] #USPS  https://t.co/lsTQcxXajD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not to mention attacks on government institutions, separation of powers, the Constitution, and democracy itself.  Trump does not deserve a second term. It would be disastrous: For the US as a world leader, for the Americans way of life &amp; for democracy. #TrumpFailedAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #USPS "is currently suffering a financial crunch exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The funding shortage has increased service disruptions and heightened fears that voters' ballots may not get delivered on time..." More:  https://t.co/LUQbUWDzRR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump's #HHS claims it is committed to data transparency on #COVID19  It is not, or the two systems would have been available to the public at all times. Azar should be asked repeatedly until he answers why Americans cannot see the data their taxes have paid for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gov't data, privatized: "Previously public data has already disappeared from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention‚Äôs website after the Trump administration quietly shifted control of the information to the Department of Health and Human Services."  https://t.co/sPFJbfjkcG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@maddow is talking w/Montana Sen. Jon Tester on @MSNBC right now ab. #USPS in his state.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of our IL Senators, a veteran who relies on mail-order prescriptions: #USPS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All you veterans, seniors, disabled persons ... anyone who gets prescriptions by mail ... may have to negotiate with your #healthcare #insurance to get more lead time for your refill prescriptions.  #USPS has slowed down mail to prevent on-time mail ballots.  #DeJoyMustGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you, Pres. Obama, for saying this.  The #USPS should be non-political. It's a service every American needs and enjoys.  Using it to suppress voting is unAmerican.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And he is using a man who wants to dismantle the #USPS as his henchman.  #DeJoyMustGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cannot be legal.  Congress needs information in order to do its job. NDAs are anathema to government, anyway, except for national security.  This is &gt;the people's government&lt;. It does not belong to any individual or group.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's no accident that Trump attacked the #USPS while Congress is in recess.  We told you he'd do whatever he could to undermine #Election2020. And people said we were alarmists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear creditors,  You may not get your payments on time. Not our fault  Sincerely, Citizens who pay bills by US Mail  #USPSisEssential<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They said it yesterday. Still true today.   https://t.co/tmiZg9ZsRT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An excellent thread on what Trump is doing to the democratic republic we love.  Destruction of government itself and privatization of its functions are key. But it's not merely that.  Read on. And weep for America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The US government is not a political institution for Trump's personal use. Yet that is how he is using the White House.  He holds daily political events &amp; uses reporters as props. The RNC will hold part of its convention in the People's House &amp; the #GOP supports it. #CORRUPTION<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"There‚Äôs no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the United States, according to numerous investigations and studies."  Reporters need to investigate: Why does Trump push a bogus allegation? Is it easier to cheat if people vote in person? Why?  That's the story I want to read.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does the #GOP believe in a democratic republic any more? Do #Republicans still owe their primary loyalty to the Constitution?  These are serious questions, b/c the GOP has been acting like a cult of personality loyal to an autocratic dictator.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DeJoy failed to consider the consequences of his decisions. Don't lean on "unintended". It's his job to know what travels by mail.  People are not getting their medications. Social Security checks, bills &amp; payments are delayed.  DeJoy should resign. #USPS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this.  Even the orders given by Wolf and Cuccinelli were and are currently invalid.   https://t.co/DQ6i64FAGy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump administration: Every day a new outrage.  Every day some illegal, immoral, or even criminal conduct.  Vote them, and their allies in Congress, out in November.  #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #USPS is a government operated service for all Americans. It is NOT a business, nor should it be run as a business.  And it should be funded, at least in part, by taxpayers.  Trump is withholding funding for the USPS. That's why its "financial position is dire".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This. #DHS  https://t.co/lh9O2i25ls<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ESCORT THEM OUT TODAY.  #DHS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone, Trump is practically screaming "Just try to stop me from cheating to win the election" and Republicans are absolutely silent on his efforts.  We must vote them out in an overwhelming rejection of their lack of integrity and devotion to the Constitution. #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Democrats in both the House and Senate have written to Trump ally and new #USPS head Louis DeJoy demanding an explanation and "urging him not to issue new directives for handling election mail ahead of November's general election." #Election2020  https://t.co/ZsTCmfk4Ct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Must-watch.  #CORRUPTION #Trump  https://t.co/4JMoPlsuY0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The House passed the HEROES Act in mid-May. The Senate has had months to consider the bill or pass its own relief bill.  The GOP-led Senate left for a vacation, after doing nothing to help ordinary Americans who still face unemployment &amp; eviction during this #pandemic. #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. Not a surprise. At all.  Republicans apparently cannot handle the truth.  Pretending that the #pandemic is pver, and that "if you don't test, you won't have cases" (as Trump says), actually are hurts people. Americans deserve to know the truth ab. #COVID19.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump continuing to create havoc. We knew it was going to get worse.  Just how much worse remains to be seen. He has until Jan. 21, you know. #TrumpMustGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wondering why, during August, terrible things are happening and our Senate isn't taking action?  1) Mitch McConnell 2) The Senate is in recess until September  So there's no push-back against Trump's outrageous acts. DO NOT BLAME DEMOCRATS. The GOP owns the Senate. #VoteBlue2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Outrageous. People rely on the #USPS for more than #VoteByMail.   Contact your Senators. Tell them they should insist to McConnell that the country must have support for the #USPS in an election year during a pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only a candidate who's scared of losing would want Americans' votes to be delayed and go uncounted.  #TrumpHatesDemocracy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What kind of hogwash is this?  Desperation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Q: If voting in elections is a duty and a right, why can't our tax dollars pay for election ballot mailing?  Stop considering it "first class mail" to be paid for. Give it priority and make it free.  Trump acts like financial support for #VoteByMail is partisan. Malarkey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Soldiers rely on #USPS for mail from and election ballots (as they have thru war and peace) and for veterans rely on it for their prescriptions.  Trump's war on the Postal Service is a direct hit on US military service members.  #malfeasance #corruption  https://t.co/0x7UhD9d8D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And Trump is blocking funding for #USPS, adding insult to injury.  "Trump said he would not approve $25 billion in emergency funding for the Postal Service, or $3.5 billion in supplemental funding for election resources, citing prohibitively high costs."  https://t.co/tixUvizIBB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To say it plainly:  Trump is sabotaging the United States Postal Service, a service he's corrupting as our top Executive, and our ability to #VoteByMail, b/c he thinks slowing mail delivery will help his reelection.  Using Presidential power for personal purposes. #Corruption<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alarming.  Trump admits slowing down mail delivery b/c he's afraid of #VoteByMail ballots.  Slowing down ballots is an assault on democracy. + He's slowing bill payment, medication deliveries, medical supply deliveries, #SocialSecurity checks. #Corruption #malfeasance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Terrific AP summary.  Parents are having to decide whether to send kids to school, a choice between getting sick or falling behind. And Trump is focusing on water pressure, a "pet peeve of the President", during a pandemic.  Trump gave up on saving Americans.  #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@michelleinbklyn argues that there must be consequences for the Trump admin's #malfeasance and #corruption.  Trump has undermined all America once held dear, particularly the rule of law. Will we allow that to continue until democracy's dead?   https://t.co/zgVwNjuj2b<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump is blocking $$ for the #USPS?  Seriously? During an election year in which we have a pandemic, causing a rise in #VoteByMail?  How is this not purposeful election interference? How is this not cheating? #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Promising to do something he cannot do (reallocating federal funds).  Congress has the power to fund or defund programs.  Getting really tired of Trump claiming he's got the power of the purse and can do whatever he wants. #SocialSecurity #Medicare    https://t.co/QkZ3hfKeCG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you want to protect #SocialSecurity and #Medicare, there's only one choice in 2020: #BidenHarris.  If you want to protect them for your grandparents, parents, or yourself, there's only one choice: @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris.  Trump keeps promising to defund both.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Texas' #COVID19 test positivity rate is 24%!  Holy cow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the ticket.  #Election2020 #BidenHarris2020   https://t.co/BPtnDVzrMF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to @KamalaHarris right now, and crying.  She and @JoeBiden are saying what needs to be said.  Americans need new leadership.  #BidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just as bad: Demanding #LiabilityWaivers for employers during a pandemic, or the Senate won't pass relief bills, so that employees have no legal recourse when their workplace is unsafe, while at the same time saying that unemployment assistance is "excessive". #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolute agree, @SenatorDurbin.  Employees should not have to bear all the risks while employers have liability protections. Employer liability waivers are NOT just.  Employees should unionize to fight this unequal treatment under the law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disastrous. Will speed up global warming.  No doubt a result of political, not scientific, advice.  If there's a bad decision to be made, Trump political appointees will make it. #methane #environment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly right.  #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not good.  "A research team at the University of Florida succeeded in isolating live virus from aerosols collected at a distance of seven to 16 feet from patients hospitalized with Covid-19..." #COVID19  https://t.co/MskZtHpp77<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's the promise and opportunity this country always stood for. That's the America I love.  And that's the American we will have when we elect #BidenHarris in November.  Congratulations @KamalaHarris. Cannot wait to vote for you and @JoeBiden! #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BTW--Please stop using "raise your hand if"... We're not school children.  FYI--I scroll past any tweet that starts w/that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What IS Trump running on?  A Biden-Harris ticket has much to offer, including stabilizing healthcare during a pandemic and equitable justice.  Trump admin. sued to try to invalidate Obamacare &amp; instituted secret police violating Americans' rights. #BidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will be thrilled to vote for a #BidenHarris ticket in 2020.  #VoteBlue2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still a major bottleneck in reducing community spread.  An infected person going about their business for 3 days can transmit the virus to dozens.  Of course if we had a President who‚Äôd invoked the Defense Production Act to increase testing and tracing capacities... #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big #COVID19 numbers!  https://t.co/DiozHJZwkj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have been at home for 153 days hoping my fellow Americans could make a commitment to eradicate this virus.   Other Presidents have dealt effectively with biological threats. This one refused. It‚Äôs a complete failure of leadership.  #TrumpFailedAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's what he said. And, the pandemic was in 1918-1919. And it did NOT end WWII. #TrumpIsNotWell   https://t.co/h0vdixUS6d<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who's befuddled and confused? Who's "not mentally sharp enough" to be President?  Seems like that's Trump. #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Illinois takes public health seriously. We've had a mask requirement for months. Yet some think they should be exempt &amp; have physically attacked those reminding them that they are not.

<|startoftext|>VERY tired of hearing ab. which group should be sacrificed to Trump's agenda.  Until #COVID19 is under control, stop telling specific groups--'essential workers', elderly, or teachers--that they're selfish for not risking their lives.  Trump should have acted. He failed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have a triumvirate of horrors: Pres. Trump Maj. Leader McConnell AG Barr  Defining which one is worst isn't the problem. They work in concert. It's the confluence of their acts that is destroying the Constitution and the rule of law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Math...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. Well said.  #COVID19 #pandemic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Joe Biden is not a public official.  Trump is, someone swore to abide by his oath of office to faithfully execute US laws, including ethics laws. It is unlawful to promote a political campaign from the White House.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whoa. #COVID19    https://t.co/pckjBsFxu0  https://t.co/uOZ1JbSdUp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"The president has cast himself in the starring role of the blameless victim..." Rather than blameless, Trump's caused most of the country's problems, and his own.  The "leader" who said he takes no responsibility at all. No sympathy. #TrumpFailedAmerica   https://t.co/3F2q8HpyC2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is prevention such a hard sell? Other countries have slowed the spread. Americans seem addicted to gambling on their individual futures and the future of the country. But the virus keeps winning, just like the house. #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shouldn't the fact that #Republicans do not want people to cast their ballots easily bother Americans?  Shouldn't we conclude that the GOP wishes people would NOT VOTE?  What does that say ab. their commitment to democracy? #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. The Kansas Experiment was a colossal failure.  Yet the #GOP continues to promote the same "ideology" and approaches to governing. They did not learn from it, but neither did American voters, who continue to vote for those "ideas". Ignorant or stupid, the outcome's the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good grief. Want #SocialSecurity? #Medicare?  Trump's defunding them. By Executive Order.  #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace   https://t.co/8o0s9pA1YT<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What? Congress OWNS the purse.  And: "It's unclear how the president might be able to do those things unilaterally.

<|startoftext|>Such a baby. Cannot even manage a bit of challenge.  And some people consider him as strong? When he runs away whenever someone asks a legitimate question?  Trump keeps proving he's a weak man, a whiner, and a fraud.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>For those who mourn lost seasons for #athletes, whether amateur or professional, here's sobering news regarding #COVID19 longer-term impacts:  Doctors are worried that those who recover may face dire or lasting heart complications.   https://t.co/K4JGK7XJKZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even after the acute symptoms of #COVID19 resolve, many patients still experience symptoms that resemble Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.

<|startoftext|>Doing what Obamacare already does? That law already protects pre-existing conditions.  Trump‚Äôs envy of Obama knows no boundaries.

<|startoftext|>Dems passed the HEROES Act in May, w/relief for the country during the #pandemic.  GOP had all that time to come up with a counter-proposal.

<|startoftext|>Trump administration now reaching back across the decades to employ liars and criminals from previous corrupt administrations.  (Yes, I know Abrams received a pardon. But a pardon also means he accepted his guilt.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump often "blurs the line" between what's legal and illegal, pushing boundaries.  We have to push back against all these ways he's trying to cheat, and undermine the rule of law, to win re-election.  Democracy's on the line. #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly.  McConnell has longed to devastate #SocialSecurity and #Medicare since his #TrumpTaxScam reduced revenues to the federal government. He *planned* to invoke "deficits" caused by tax cuts  in order to justify reduce or eliminate Americans' benefits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unemployment Rate = 10.2% Unemployed = 16.3 M  "Despite declines over the past 3 months, these measures are up by 6.7 percentage points and 10.6 million, respectively, since February." --Bureau of Labor Statistics   https://t.co/0rngLxqS56<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>ICYMI: Biden has spoken ab. his faith and how it helped him manage his grief.   https://t.co/cmAneiQ6Fg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  Reminds me of the film, "Head of State", where the GOP candidate claims his opponent is "for cancer".  Trump's desperation is laugh-worthy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Magical thinking.  Next thing you know #Republicans will be claiming the laws of thermodynamics don't apply to them, and the sun rises in the west. And their supporters will parrot their assertions.  Shared delusions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doubtful a vaccine will be available for #COVID19 by election day.  Trump's so desperate for re-election that he's willing to lie ab. public health in order to give false hope to people.  Another reason to vote him out. We need truthful leadership.  https://t.co/1R3ZU2Kt1d<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep.  Really exhausted by press not giving the full picture and repeating Trump's statements as if his word is good enough.  His promises are worthless.  https://t.co/Mhc8txiHff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TRUMP IS A CONGENITAL LIAR. You cannot believe almost everything the man says.  How about that for the headline.  At least that much is true.   https://t.co/Ylc7eEAqd0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#VoteByMail has been proven safe and effective. Many states use ONLY mail-in voting. Others allow absentee ballots without requiring a reason.  If we had planned early in the #pandemic, everyone could have voted by mail in Nov.  Voting is a right. #Vote  https://t.co/zZB3wbwlGU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you don't believe in the right to vote, you don't believe in #democracy. It really is that simple.  Stop trying to prevent citizens from voting. Make voting easy: -Give people time off to vote or -Make election day a national holiday -Automatically register high school seniors<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Rep. Rodney Davis (R-IL13) has #COVID19.   https://t.co/Yh8ES4HyWD<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Meant *soldiers* not veterans (although veterans could vote by mail too).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shows just how ridiculous the Trump argument is.  Mail-in voting has been used by veterans for literal decades without fraud.  Trump's desperation is on full display over this issue. #VoteByMail<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And then there‚Äôs this.  #BackToSchool   https://t.co/pbWh1h9r21<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mississippi children went back to school and...  #BackToSchool2020   https://t.co/upT7TXx2g9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump's #corruption should become an everyday discussion.  Rep. Demings said during Trump's impeachment "trial": "President Trump's constitutional crimes, his crimes against the American people and the nation, remain in progress."  As predicted, Trump has not stopped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Indefatigabl_ @Alheri @zeynep I had surgical glue used on an incision. Best healing incision I've had (and I'd had seven surgeries prior w/o glue). Very little scarring. Wished my hip surgeon could have used it too. Amazing tech indeed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Horrifying.   Want a scapegoat? Blame the man who has the power but refuses to do anything to curb this #pandemic. That man is not Dr. Fauci, who knows what we need to do but keeps getting his expert advice ignored.  Or blame the virus. #COVID19  isn‚Äôt the messenger‚Äôs fault.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is this an acceptable situation?   Are people going to accept a quarter of a million Americans dead this year while our federal government does virtually nothing, in policy or action, to halt the spread of the #COVID #pandemic?  Trump‚Äôs response: ‚ÄúIt is what it is.‚Äù  https://t.co/js1HyIiXj4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someone has to say this:  That is not equal access to voting.  Again, Trump believes in having the authority to grant privileges over rights enshrined in our Constitution. #VotingRights<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Suspending the payroll tax basically hurts retirees. And it does NOT help the unemployed. It's no solution to today's problems.  Please do not even consider it, @SpeakerPelosi and @SenSchumer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember: Ordinary Americans BEGIN paying attention to Presidential elections somewhere between the conventions and election day itself.  &gt;Do not believe early polls. &gt;VOTE and get everyone you know to vote.  American democracy is on the ballot. #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AND...here you go.  #SchoolReopening   https://t.co/KwWftwOSBw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is correct. Some people cannot go back to work b/c the businesses have closed &amp; cannot get new jobs b/c the economy is shrinking.  They need assistance NOW or evictions &amp; homelessness will increase. And #COVID19 will spread. Think of the consequences of NOT helping people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump must be delusional.  Children can get &amp; spread #COVID19 b/c it's so contagious. And kids get sick.  Nationally there are: ~60,000 cases/day &gt;1,000 dead/day  How many Americans will have long-term effects or die before it "goes away"?  Trump's negligence is killing people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MMcHarry I assumed the 13% were the very wealthy, still happy with their tax cuts, as well as the corporate board members happy with the stock market and looming liability waivers against lawsuits from employees forced to work during a #pandemic.  But there could be others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Currently, 13% of U.S. adults are satisfied with the state of the nation..."  based on a July 1-23 #GallupPoll<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After watching @CBSNews' report on Briggs &amp; Stratton's plant, still convinced employees should not have to bear all the #COVID19 risks while employers get legal protections.  Congress must not protect corporations and leave employees w/o recourse.  #NoCorporateImmunity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disturbing. Local control denied. Public health ignored.  Everyone involved w/schools should have input. Pretending kids won't spread #COVID19 is utter denial.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, please, declassify this information.  Americans have a right to know ab. ALL foreign interference in our sovereign elections.  #ElectionIntegrity<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This exchange. Horrifying.  Swan: Lyndon Johnson! He passed the Civil Rights Act. Trump: Ask, ask: how has it worked out? If you take a look at what Lyndon Johnson did. How has it worked out? Swan: You think the Civil Rights Act was a mistake?   https://t.co/zDN57HB08j<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AxiosOnHBO Trump interview by @jonathanvswan:   Finally asked ab. #RussianBountiesOnOurTroops, Trump deflects...but reveals that he doesn't want to believe it's true.  Galling to say the least.  https://t.co/hAuVw1Ulsv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good analysis of the @Axios @jonathanvswan Trump interview.  Shocking parts show how Swan gives Trump openings to care ab. Americans' suffering in many contexts.  Revealing: "Trump‚Äôs true position here, laid bare, is that 'this is the best we can do'."  https://t.co/qJSFEDOsrF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump's propaganda ab. the USPS should worry Americans, not b/c the USPS cannot handle election mail but b/c we have such a dishonest President, willing to lie in order to persuade people not to believe in public institutions--and to manipulate the public's behavior.  Disgusting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I recoiled in horror during Trump's commentary ab. John Lewis; his absolute focus was on himself.  His claim that "Nobody has done more for black Americans than I have" is beyond untrue.  I was alive when Lyndon Johnson signed both the Civil Rights Act + VRA. Trump dishonors him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My impression, too. Seems like a Trump's primary strategy: -Flood the interviewer with BS -Never let the interviewer get a full question -Never answer the question directly or completely -Brag ab. "achievements"; claim untrue historic proportions  https://t.co/FOWjoayWKz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's one clip from that interview. [FYI: Swan's father is apparently the Australian Dr. Fauci, so Swan probably knows ab. medical statistics--and how they can be manipulated.]   https://t.co/qvHRylU03F<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tired: "Because we have more tests, we have more cases."--Trump  We get new cases when they are diagnosed. Period. It's not "cases" that cause #COVID19; it's a virus.  Trump's obsessed w/numbers he doesn't understand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching the #Swan interview now: Trump is a conversational bully. He refuses to let his interviewer even complete a question. Astonishing how pushy &amp; insistent he is, even when he has absolutely nothing new to say; he "informs" Swan ab. things anyone would know + misinforms. SMH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree 100%. No reason for employees to bear all the risks while employers get legal protections.   If Congress agrees, it means they do not care about your life and safety. They care more about protecting corporate donations.   #NoCorporateImmunity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Folks, things are not going well, contrary to the Trump administration‚Äôs claims.   #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump‚Äôs own son won‚Äôt be going back to school this fall.  Parents and teachers will do whatever they deem necessary to keep their students safe.  #backtoschool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump‚Äôs demand is ridiculous. It‚Äôs up to local school boards, teachers‚Äô unions, and parents.   Besides, there‚Äôs a #COVID19 outbreak among employees in a Georgia school‚Äîa problem caused by Trump‚Äôs administration failure to take this #pandemic seriously.   https://t.co/gD1nhAPzr4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have been having nightmares ab. how bad the economics could get, if Congress doesn't act.  My parents grew up during the Great Depression. Heard stories all my life ab. how bad it was. When I think ab. the confluence of possible failures today, it gives me chills.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously terrifying.   Megalomania in the White House.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As if.   Grifter-In-Chief believes he should get a cut of almost anything...he even mentions.   Who thinks like that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very concerned about this, too.  Employers must take all necessary safety precautions to get any kind of liability waivers. Otherwise, nope.  Employees should not have to bear &gt;all&lt; risks to have a job. #COVID19<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It is illegal to accept foreign contributions to an election campaign.  Again, it is illegal. If the Trump campaign accepts contributions, those involved should be investigated.  A campaign should not have to dodge or evade the question: Biden's campaign's answer was correct.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Recall: Trump has expressed virtually no sympathy for Americans suffering &amp; dying during this #COVID19 #pandemic.  Kushner's indifference to blue states' pandemic needs was a tell too. It's fair to conclude Trump doesn't care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ASlavitt FWIW, he was busy with trying to get rid of healthcare, banning  travel &amp; immigrants, separating children from parents, extorting Ukraine,  raising prices on imports thru tariffs, making money off the Presidency, &amp; ruining our relationships with allies.

<|startoftext|>Trump's logic:  If you don't  -have a mammogram, you can't have breast cancer. -have a blood test, you can't have anemia. -have a #coronavirus test, you can't have #COVID19   His disordered thinking kills people.  **Cases are caused by the virus**, not by testing.  Tired of this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unbelievable. An American President + his SIL were actively working to ensure that Americans in blue states got sick &amp; died w/o the help they needed.  How much obscene criminal negligence is enough for you, #Republicans? Killing political "enemies" is a hallmark of dictatorships.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Americans deserve to know what's happening to their elections.   If there's foreign election interference, withholding vital information from voters is unconscionable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump has no strategy for #COVID19.  He tolerates tens of thousands of cases per day and hundreds of thousands of deaths, blaming governors when healthcare is overwhelmed.

<|startoftext|>Weird watching ads on TV now. No one in masks.  People playing sports. People enjoying various crowded venues.

<|startoftext|>This is largely b/c Trump has neglected to adequately and strategically devise a national #pandemic policy that would allow the US economy to resume safely.

<|startoftext|>The government bought millions of doses before the drug was proven ineffective. Not only that, Trump wants to be cast as a #pandemic hero. He thinks that‚Äôll help his re-election.   So he‚Äôs promoting the drug for many reasons, but not for actual beneficial ones.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Add to this: Payroll tax cuts mean you don't contribute to SS; they cannot help the unemployed, who get no paychecks.

<|startoftext|>Trump heard that he's losing the support of #Suburban women. So he invented a threat to the suburbs to try to generate fear and induce their support.  Like that's going to work.

<|startoftext|>Knew it would come to this. Straight from the dictator's playbook.  Trump's admired Putin, Kim, Xi, or Erdogan. Shaping the US into a dictatorship is what he's always longed for.  The US cannot survive as a democratic republic if we give Trump another term. #Biden2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump's push for #deregulation was, and always was intended to, designed to help companies--NOT ordinary Americans.  He likes to talk about faucets and showers; recall that he develops luxury hotels. It's not ab. people; it's about business and financial considerations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Regulations are PROTECTIONS.

<|startoftext|>Hate to have to keep saying this:  #COVID19 doesn't care about politics or religion, "freedom" or "rights". It infects where &amp; when it can.

<|startoftext|>Not likely to please Trump yet should be considered.  Science matters. Since the US seems unable to manage transmission, staying home, social distancing &amp; wearing masks can help.

<|startoftext|>Returning to "normal" (including #SchoolReopening) requires taking serious measures to control #COVID19 transmission.  As these European countries have shown, below.  Right now, the Trump admin. has no plans to work w/states on managing transmission.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Proud to have @TammyforIL @SenDuckworth serve Illinois as one of our senators. She serves with integrity, dignity, and honor, represents all of our state, not just her party, and upholds the ideals we cherish.  We need more women like her in the Senate. #ToughAsHell<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Also had the thought that Trump cannot run on his record, which is abysmally weak, but must instead create an enemy which he'd use to "unite" his supporters against, to reuse the MAGA slogan, an appeal to true believers.

<|startoftext|>McFaul's comments echo my own thoughts.  Trump's speech tries to redefine terms, in typical "up is down" gaslighting fashion. The claims Trump makes aren't about real threats; they're projections of what he'd do to suppress dissent (as he so often does).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Failing to do what was best for the country thru their silence.  #ComplicitCorruptGOP    https://t.co/sFGyOWEZET<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow.  Not surprised by Trump. That's who he is. Horrified by those who heard and informed no one. Dereliction of duty by his cabinet. #TrumpTraitor<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Definitely a must-watch.  #TrumpTreason #TRE45ON<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The subtweet of the week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Without question. Trump's failure to respond to Putin targeting American soldiers sends a global message of American weakness and obeisance to a hostile foreign power. Agree with McFaul:   https://t.co/zynZ06W3n8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this:   https://t.co/W2eypB9KXe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the worst aspects of his response to the situation: He refuses to condemn Putin's Russia, even when US (and allied) intelligence provides confirmation--and then does nothing else, nothing to protect our troops.  Trump is #UnfitToBePresident.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Proving how #UnfitToBePresident he is, Trump golfs to address national critical issues: -Russia offered bounties on US soldiers -US #COVID19 cases rising in 48 states; 125K+ deaths -FDA approved faulty antibody tests -14.7% unemployment; aid ending -Re-election polls tank<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This.  https://t.co/s2C69Dlf4b<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do not let this story go.  Trump must have known that Russia had put bounties on our service men and women in Afghanistan. He's the Commander-in-Chief. It's his duty to know.  Yet he claims he didn't know. We cannot accept his denial.  #TrumpRussia   https://t.co/J7d2HSfQOn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unbelievable. Just to be clear, no one should believe this.  Trump's defenders will do anything to protect their 'dear leader', including lying to support whatever Trump says.  This admin. has NO credibility.  [Ex: They even lied to protect his hurricane idiocy.]<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very hard to wait for the answer to this question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WHY don't people understand #COVID19?  They: -Think it's like a cold -Think only old people get sick &amp; die -Believe they're impervious -Believe God will protect them -Think it's over None of these is true. (Devout ppl get sick.)  So, please: -Inform yourself -Use reliable sources<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Problem:  Some people don't know that they have #COVID19 but spread it to others before they become symptomatic; others w/o symptoms only find out they have the virus after they're tested.  The only ways to protect yourself and others: -Stay home If you must go out: -Wear a mask<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can Trump's inaction be tolerated? Where is the no outrage in DC? #TrumpTraitor #TraitorInChief    https://t.co/XMSwIo7FtT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Allowing our service men and women to remain at risk while befriending the perpetrator is a particularly evil act. Yet that's what Trump has done. It is traitorous to American troops and to our country.  #TrumpTraitor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PSA: I, too, have asthma, just like this young lady, but I'm a retiree, with other health conditions as well.

<|startoftext|>#COVID19 affects multiple organ systems. Since this is a new disease, scientists are not sure, yet, who will have long-term complications or how they will manifest.  Still, evidence mounts that there can be longer-term effects.  https://t.co/1esfwvQevz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely outrageous.  That Trump does nothing when he knows that a foreign nation plotted to attack our troops has the taint of #treason. And, treason is the right word when we're at war.  Where is the outrage from Congress?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. This thread.   Her campaign ad is &lt;chef's kiss&gt;.  Missourians, if you life in her district, pay attention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even during a #pandemic, when people need healthcare even more than usual, the Trump admin. is in court, trying to allow insurers to take health insurance away from those w/pre-existing conditions. And #COVID19 could become one.  Unusually cruel. #Obamacare #ACA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Republicans have said they wanted to "Repeal and Replace" #Obamacare since its inception.  Their "replacement" plan doesn't exist. The Trump admin.'s case in #SCOTUS to invalidate the #ACA will allow insurers to deny you health insurance even if you have pre-existing conditions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pence just proved it by estimating that #COVID19 will cause 240,000 deaths in the US (double what we've had).  Their plan: Accept the death toll. Do nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But everybody should go back to work? Everybody should go "back to normal"?  Every time this administration talks ab. projected death counts, they increase their estimates dramatically.  240,000 DOUBLES the current number of deaths.  How could that be acceptable? #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be concerned.   Take precautions.  You know what to do: -Wear a mask -Avoid large groups -Stay at home when you can -Protect the vulnerable -Demand better from your government #COVID19   https://t.co/FEXFpdQ4j1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>-Inadequate PPE -Inadequate swabs -Inadequate testing ("slow the testing down"--Trump)  This renewed #COVID19 outbreak is going to cause untold suffering.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hate to be a downer but reality hits hard.   https://t.co/fktIhWCc8a<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lie.  The US had its highest number of #COVID19 cases in a single day just yesterday. States like AZ, FL, and TX are all in crisis. Houston is at 100% capacity of ICU beds.  &gt; Happy talk does not solve a #pandemic crisis. &lt;  Pence is failing as he did as Gov. of Indiana.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly.   The best thing we can do for the #economy is to take  #COVID19 seriously.  Until the #pandemic is under control, the economy cannot recover.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The US has a #COVID19 #pandemic crisis b/c Trump + his enablers are willfully ignorant, in denial, or engaging in magical thinking.  We cannot imagine the virus will "just go away". People are getting ill &amp; some are dying.  Stop pretending all is well &amp; take precautions. Today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Mask tips interactive.  #MaskUp  https://t.co/o2FZP4wFRC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FL had its highest ever #COVID19 positive numbers:  https://t.co/3TgVgdoqCD<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And don't get me started on TX. (Have relatives there.) Here's Houston. Just one of the big cities in that state. #COVID19   https://t.co/8VSFB3Z5hk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This thread shows how #Republican-run AZ and FL have failed their residents during the pandemic. And they're not the only states that blithely pretended that the virus "would just go away", as Trump cavalierly asserted.  https://t.co/HdGfAGWc9T<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the midst of a pandemic &amp; economic disaster, #Republicans oversold "small government" to the point of not governing at all. They needed to use of levers of power to resolve these crises, but failed to act quickly &amp; effectively. People suffered &amp; died as a result. #VoteBlue2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So 5% might die. But many more could get very ill. Not just for a couple of weeks. And some may have long-term effects afterwards: On lungs, heart, kidneys, even liver. Or develop diabetes.  #COVID19 is not an ordinary illness. See:  https://t.co/4Vuhr41R8f  https://t.co/Cxv9FihiqM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump has no idea what he'd do w/a second term. Or he can't focus long enough to recall what was asked. Or he doesn't want us to know what he'd do.   The word salad answer he gives isn't what Americans want to help combat a pandemic &amp; revive our economy. #VoteOutTheGOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump, in his own words, ab. #COVID19.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>During a pandemic.  If #SCOTUS invalidates #Obamacare, health insurance companies can deny insurance due to pre-existing conditions. And #COVID19 could be one.  Really terrible for all Americans. #ACA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Republicans want to end coverage for pre-existing conditions, too, so that anyone who's been diagnosed with a condition could once again be denied health insurance.   https://t.co/BYRJay7U4W<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what #Republicans want:  To take healthcare away from Americans. And they're willing to go all the way to the Supreme Court to argue that it should be.  During the #COVID19 pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Barr's view of his role as AG is flawed, at best. And hypocritical (see above). He tried to insert himself into politically sensitive cases:  https://t.co/lveTLxHyNX<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ease the safeguards put in place to guard against another financial crisis?  Banks: "What, me worry?" #VolkerRule  https://t.co/y3yiNil5Jz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The projection of Trump administration officials is mind-boggling.   Whatever they claim the other party has done is exactly what they're planning to do and currently doing. This man is a danger to the rule of law and must be removed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrianTBrown2 True, and very sad.  Hardly a winning pitch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not surprised at all. Expected it.  Trump wants to pretend there's no pandemic, encourage people to "return to normal" so they can support his desire to get "his economy" back to help his re-election.  If people are afraid or sick (or dead) that won't and can't work. #COVID19<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Trump wants to -pretend #COVID19 is gone -downplay its seriousness -restrict testing to pretend there are fewer cases -tell people to go back to work -fail to produce adequate PPE to support of his re-election hopes  That's not how to fight a pandemic or revive an economy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cases are rising again in the US.

<|startoftext|>YIKES.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This administration and its enablers + supporters have accelerated their attempts to shape justice (and other aspects of the Executive) to their liking w/unqualified judges and questionable acts, speeding it up in case Trump doesn't win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And many of them are truly unqualified to be US judges.  This is shameful, not something to be touted. Republicans are failing the rule of law with these confirmations. #judges<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems like the wrong time to defund #COVID19 testing.  Cases are up by 40% nationally.  People are still going to get sick and die, whether they're tested or not.  Trump administration chooses to take action that will hurt Americans.  https://t.co/H8amWo7C3u<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The childishness. The selfishness. The denial.  It's as if he's a 4-year-old saying: "If someone else can spread #COVID19, why can't I do it too?"  As my departed mother would say, "If they jumped off a bridge into traffic, would you have to do that too?"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Americans deserve to know whether the healthcare system will be ready for the obviously increasing numbers of cases we're seeing since states began "reopening" during a pandemic.

<|startoftext|>Indeed.  It's the biggest self-own Trump could display.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>They obviously don't care about Americans w/#COVID19, or Americans' health or healthcare.  Claim one thing, Pence; prove this administration doesn't mean it, Trump. All in a single rally. #TrumpRallyTulsa    https://t.co/eBsoDRNtU8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They made attendees sign a waiver holding the Trump campaign harmless if they became sick with #COVID19, a tacit admission that they were had no intention of putting "the health of America first".  What gaslighting. #TrumpRallyTulsa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly what I was thinking.  Trump wants to avoid #obstructionofjustice charges against him.

<|startoftext|>What worries me most ab. people in public w/o masks, who don't heed public health warnings &amp; who attend the Tulsa rally or travel to Vegas or Orlando for fun:  They may get #COVID19 &amp; bring it to their families, friends, co-workers + tax the health system.  Some people will die.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone who meets with Trump is tested beforehand, and confirmed to be free of #COVID19.  So of course he's cocky about it and refuses to wear a mask.   It never occurs to him to set an example for the Americans he claims to lead, either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We must fully understand: The man who sits in the Oval Office does not believe in American democracy, and regularly violates his oath to "preserve, protect and defend the Constitution".  Just today he implied that protesters had no right to be in Tulsa. Trump is #UnfitForOffice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A reminder that the President is expected to consider ALL the people, not just those he panders to, those who are members of his exclusive club, those who are the 1%.  That a country of, by, and for the people shall not perish... #VoteJoeBidenToSaveAmerica<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The President actually said that journalists should be executed. Trump doesn't believe in American values, such as freedom of the press.

<|startoftext|>Trump doesn't care for the rule of law or real justice. [His idea of justice is getting what he wants, when he wants it, as he likes it, and seeking vengeance on his perceived enemies. (That's not justice.)]  Empty words:  https://t.co/zsdqCKrN0a<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump continues to try to blame his predecessor for things he claims Obama "never did" (false) in order to stake a claim to his own imagined heroism.  Trump's an actor and pretender. He never really wanted to govern. His game plan plan was always grift...and vengeance. Sickening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This administration will be recalled for the worst words and acts in American history.  Every day another outrage. Most days multiple outrageous statements and acts. Never a #Republican rebuke.  https://t.co/bc5hgo214H<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Outrageous statement. Beyond appalling.  Trump's disgraceful rhetoric should have serious consequences, yet no #Republicans have the courage to even provide the mildest rebuke. Their cowardice is atrocious.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@brianklaas The stain is indelible for the party.  Just realized today that I can never vote for a Republican again. They've tied themselves to unethical practices, lack of transparency, contempt for voters, and unending grift. They don't deserve to survive as a party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching this band of corrupt grifters loot our government has turned me off to #Republicans forever.  Never voting for a Republican, even in a local election.

<|startoftext|>Disturbing.  Police must protect the rights of journalists.  When rights are repeatedly violated, the Constitution, the rule of law, and the nation are at risk for everyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely outrageous. Whoever authorized these purchases should be prosecuted for malfeasance. Those were taxpayer funds intended for other uses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@FoxNews tries to prove it's in the disinformation, not the news, business. "...a clear violation of ethical standards for news organizations", notes this article. Glad they were called out.  Credibility lost forever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Forcing people  to respect the *symbols* of a nation  when their government doesn't respect  rights enshrined in its Constitution  wounds a republic.  Symbols are not the country itself. A government rules by &gt;consent of its people&lt;.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>How do you go to a locale w/the supposed intent of speaking about #policing issues and fail to invite the top law enforcement officials.  There's a reason they were not invited: racism.  Shameful beyond measure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Women have been asserting this forever.  Now men know it.   US society simply doesn't support #childcare so any parent can work (regardless of economic circumstances). We had a broken social support system before #COVID19. Now it's even worse. Let's fix it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disturbing.   Surveillance of Americans exercising their rights would be beyond the pale. This administration and their GOP supporters in Congress have little respect for ordinary Americans. Yet they expect to get our votes to return them to office?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>IOW, Trump and enablers were involved in a #disinformation campaign. They spoke w/o knowledge and propagandized the nation.  We have to call it what it was and demand better from elected officials and media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Each week I mourn the loss to the nation of a person of education, breadth, and depth who sits in the Oval Office to consider the impact to the nation and the competing interests surrounding any issue and decision s/he must make.

It wants to *assume* those things and restrict how I interact with others based on its assumptions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can @Twitter know if someone has not read an article? I start my day reading news on various sites and come to Twitter, sometimes to share something I've read. That would NOT be thru a click-thru but it would be something I'd read.  This idea is nuts.  https://t.co/gCPlNaj3Cy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Almost as if Trump wants to encourage a second wave outbreak of #COVID19 (and is willing to be blamed for more American deaths) just to get the adulation he craves.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's *gaslighting* when our government [of, by, and for the people] asks us to question the evidence we saw with our own eyes and believe the story they've concocted to explain a news event.  I remain skeptical of literally everything this administration asserts, since they lie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SociallySteph Listen more, speak less.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Appalling.  Police should be protecting the 1A rights of the press, not doing their best to suppress #PressFreedom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fair to say that this administration has plans for after re-election that many of us would find absolutely abhorrent. This is one.

<|startoftext|>Protecting the right to vote in a **free and fair** election should be a top priority NOW in the US, well before Nov.  Seriously, contact your local &amp; state officials.

<|startoftext|>Actually it's worse. #COVID19    https://t.co/k6Npu3xXu2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After writing a long thread ab. my worries ab. #COVID19, I woke up to this story about the rise in hospitalizations in 9 states: Texas, North and South Carolina, California, Oregon, Arkansas, Mississippi, Utah and Arizona.  The pandemic is not over.  https://t.co/GBTVEQ4MZY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most worrisome to me is an acceptance of thousands of deaths, daily, in the country, as if it's nothing.  America must not become callous to the suffering #COVID19 continues to cause for family, friends, neighbors, co-workers.  We must take action to manage it effectively.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this thread...why I'm worried. #COVID19    https://t.co/T5aZsMntkB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't mean to be alarmist, but we've just had anti-lockdown protests and #BLM protests following #GeorgeFloyd's death.   There will be increases in #COVID19 cases; those increases could be unpredictable.  We can't wait for a surge or pretend it won't happen. We must be prepared.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this thread on states where #COVID19 cases are increasing concerns me too.  Is the country ready for increasing cases ... in many states? Do we have the medical supply chain ready for a pandemic 2nd wave now? Are there enough caregivers and beds?    https://t.co/fqBh7Nk9Wf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This Arizona #COVID19 news should be concerning to everyone.   https://t.co/eFg3kPRlmJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have no federal coordination plan for a 2nd #COVID19 wave. Even if we did, this administration has no idea how to manage that coordination. Trump's shifted focus from public health to economics, believing that is what will help his re-election.  But the pandemic isn't over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why I mourn: so many sick or dead. States are re-opening before they know whether their cases have been decreasing. They're concerned ab. their economies. But the dead can't work, pay taxes, or increase GDP.   New #COVID19 cases are surging. More will die.  https://t.co/SiT5ALoC2b<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thousands of Americans are dying &gt;every single day&lt; from #COVID19. Republicans apparently want us to  ignore that. They want us to pretend it's not happening, like children.

<|startoftext|>How will the nation avoid another "Project Air Bridge", should we have a second (potentially bigger) wave of #COVID19?  Really want to hear what Congress will do to make things better.

The speechwriter advocated for separating families and caging children.  Insanity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is the Legislative branch's responsibility to perform oversight on the Executive branch. Why don't journalists remind them of that?

<|startoftext|>And yet our government keeps trying to tell us that right-wing domestic terrorism is not a problem, and we have news organizations that promote the baseless idea that an alternate left-wing group is to blame for community violence.  America, you're being propagandized.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When the values of politicians are incompatible w/US democracy, will the press step up &amp; call it out?

<|startoftext|>After I watched the public shaming of the Minneapolis mayor over his opposition, I became convinced that supporters of #PoliceReform have no idea how the term "defund the police" is received by ordinary people. The term itself could undermine a worthy cause.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree that #PoliceReform is essential.  The term being used for it is simply bad branding. "Defund the police" implies the idea of abolishing them. Those who want #PoliceReform should consider the fear that "abolish police" engenders in the public at large. Really not helpful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This.  https://t.co/xN66i017Vq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most people understand that policing is necessary. The phrase "defund the police" implies "abolishing" them.  #PoliceReform is a critical need.  Some possibilities: De-militarizing police Establishing community-based policing Ending qualified immunity Etc. But abolishing? Never.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Worth your time to read this if you &gt;don't&lt; to have to rely on an employment debit card to get by during the shutdowns. A microcosm of inequality.

<|startoftext|>This. Trump administration violating #1A #Rights.   https://t.co/sVBWQUVYQh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unsurprising.  Proving that Trump + Republicans used an American citizen for political propaganda purposes during their attempt to extort a political "favor" from #Ukraine and falsely persuade Americans there was corruption.  Not holding my breath to hear their apologies, though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I‚Äôm afraid so.  A whole generation of Americans fought and died so that #fascism would be defeated. They were my parents, uncles, and aunts as well as friends of the family.  Whatever I can lawfully do to oppose fascism in the US, I will do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What must it feel like to be compelled to continuously scan the environment daily so you can ‚Äúpunch back‚Äù at everyone who‚Äôs mildly critical of you?   That‚Äôs what our President spends his time doing. Pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait. Aren't Republicans FOR religious freedom?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Euphemisms...  This man was injured by a "non-lethal sponge round" and lost his eye.  #GeorgeFloyd was murdered by a police officer's "carotid restraint".  Please stop using #euphemisms for the use of force that ends in life-altering injury or death.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This happened in our tiny neighborhood, with the Neighborhood Watch coordinator sending messages out via NextDoor.  But busloads of antifa-linked protesters are NOT coming to your neighborhood.   That is fear-mongering propaganda. Treat it as such.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My father fought in WWII, in the Italian Campaign, was wounded &amp; awarded a Purple Heart. He saw the fascist Benito Mussolini's corpse hung in Milan.   My father was anti-fascist, as were all US forces at that time. #Fascism should be opposed; it's antithetical to American values.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Greatly appreciating this essay by @anneapplebaum: "Resist the Urge to Simplify the Story".  "As protests multiply, uncertainty abounds‚Äîand Trump is using it to frighten Americans far from any violence."  Recommended reading.  https://t.co/P5fRbcFaXF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YES.  Americans are tired of being gaslit by Trump and enablers.  Truth matters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Must-watch segment.  Anne Applebaum: "This is an important sign of democratic decline."  Masha Gessen: "This is a performance of fascism...A power grab always begins as a performance."

<|startoftext|>Our government should NEVER provide unidentified "law enforcement". This is a very dangerous precedent.  Law enforcement is always accountable to the people they supposedly protect and serve. They must identify themselves when asked.   https://t.co/94YN1IqqOj<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wow. Utterly tone-deaf.  Since when does property matter more than life itself?  People are protesting b/c black people keep getting needlessly killed by police and this headline just illustrates how clueless some people are.  @PhillyInquirer should issue an apology.  #BLM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's only one reason Trump ordered more fencing around the People's House.  Trump is terrified that protesters will storm the White House and try to drag him into the streets (in an echo of Mussolini's fate?).  Doubt it'd happen. But the idea scares him.  #TerrifiedTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't police understand that protesters' complaints are about #PoliceBrutality and extrajudicial killing?   So employing brutality to "contain and control" protests illustrates precisely what these protests are all about?   https://t.co/iAEiU77XcA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey, @comcastcares. Cannot even get to your outage page to report wholesale outage in central IL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FYI, followers. Comcast Midwest major outage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Belly laugh.   Nice try but propaganda won‚Äôt work, @PressSec. We watched all of Trump‚Äôs maneuvers to try to intimidate Americans. He‚Äôs no Christian and has no clue what the 1st Amendment even says.  Can‚Äôt wait to read wha the historians of Twitter have to say about this blunder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IOW, Trump and Barr spoke without knowing the facts. They made assumptions based on their biases.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid Co-opting the symbols of religious faith as political props.   Just as patriotism isn't hugging the flag, holding a Bible or standing in a church doesn't indicate any sort of spiritual faith or depth of devotion.  Trump cons with spectacle. Offensive to all people of faith.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you, @SenDuckworth, for speaking up.  Proud that you are one of our Illinois Senators.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember how Trump was just "inspecting" the naked women in his pageants?  "Inspecting", for Trump, doesn't have an ordinary dictionary definition. As usual, Trump defines things as he wishes.  IOW, he admits that he was in the bunker.  #BunkerTrump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This guy needs to read the 1st Amendment and act accordingly.   Peaceful protests are protected by the Constitution.  Getting really exhausted by police who claim they can suspend our rights.  https://t.co/NyB0PPY0ZH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1A: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Orwellian to the max.  This administration would be a joke--if they weren't threatening us with military action for exercising our Constitutional rights.  Trump is an authoritarian strongman at heart. If we don't act, the US will become a dictatorship--in short order.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. When people protest #PoliceBrutality, they are not asking to be brutalized or to watch their family and friends be brutalized.  Peaceful protest is Constitutionally protected. Police actions prove some don't understand our rights as citizens. Reform is 100% necessary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Abuses by the police -- against journalists trying to do their jobs -- are an affront to the Constitution itself.  Appalling.  This is one reason people are protesting. Policing reforms must result from all of these protests and subsequent stories of abuse of police authority.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously.  Police violence against citizens going about their business must be halted immediately. Abuses must be prosecuted.  Our healthcare workers--fighting a pandemic, no less--don't deserve this kind of treatment just for leaving work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Must read.   This is why having a military presence in DC alarmed me this week. IMHO, you should be alarmed, too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The more Trump escalates, the more the people protest.   No one wants to have their right to assemble peacefully abridged.   Americans believe in their Constitution and will show up to demonstrate for their rights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Outrageous. Congress must investigate the legality of this move by Barr.  I don‚Äôt want to live in a police state but every day it appears that this administration wants to turn the US into one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you are police, anywhere, review the 1st Amendment. Members of  press have rights for good reasons.  This story absolutely sickened me.  When a free press goes, democracy goes with it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Important story.  For those condemning all protests, and especially those claiming they're all Antifa, it's time to revise your understanding of what's been happening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If a President can call in military police to break up a peaceful assembly and protest, which is protected by the 1st Amendment, that President can try to use the military against other protected rights we cherish.  Consider that.  It's why what Trump did yesterday is an outrage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anderson Cooper's commentary from last night is worth your time (~6 min. video).  I'm with Cooper: "Who's the thug here?"  #GeorgeFloydProtests #TrumpIncitesViolence   https://t.co/Q9gpjlYYVt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Outraged.  Hoping to see more documentation of these attacks on the Constitutionally-protected free press by police.  Hoping, too, to see action taken -- lawsuits + legislation -- to better protect press from abuse by law enforcement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes.  Today I will be engaged in all of these practices, because they are  nourishing and sustaining. Through them, the deep well of the spirit is renewed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is one of the problems:  "Facing Protests Over Use of Force, Police Respond With More Force"  We cannot reduce #PoliceBrutality with increased brutality. The logic of that is obvious. Yet police persist, even attacking the peaceful and the press.   https://t.co/DZevY8caL3<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you cannot watch Biden's speech right now, look for it online later. This is what Presidents sound like. This is a message America needs to hear.  #Biden2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Correct. Yesterday‚Äôs White House spectacle‚Äîfrom military force to Trump‚Äôs use of a place of worship and a holy book as props‚Äîwere primarily meant to support Trump‚Äôs re-election campaign.   Yet another blatant abuse of power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG. Read this.   Trump only knows spectacle. He doesn‚Äôt care who he has to shove out of the way in his desire to con Americans into believing he‚Äôs ‚Äúdominating‚Äù.    Including people of faith, on the patio of their church.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good day to review this history ... when Hitler‚Äôs police state began.  Please don‚Äôt think: ‚ÄúIt can‚Äôt happen here.‚Äù  Trump has already begun his quest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump must go. Where are you, Senators? Congress?  He's using MPs to shoot rubber bullets and tear gas at lawful protesters, &amp; using Blackhawk helicopters over DC. It's not going to get better. America cannot endure more of this wanna-be dictator.  Read Geo. Will (link below).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you thought Trump was done after his photo op, you were mistaken. He's not going to let up. He thinks this makes him look strong.  But deploying the military to suppress lawful protest is unConstitutional.  Where are our reps &amp; why aren't they talking ab. Posse Comitatus?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump's still a coward. He didn't meet w/protest leaders. He didn't meet w/black community leaders.  He called up military police. He had police shoot rubber bullets &amp; tear gas canisters at peaceful protesters.  JUST SO HE COULD MAKE HIMSELF FEEL BETTER.  Playing President.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Peacefully exercising your 1st Amendment rights should never be met by US military or excessive force.  This is WHY people are protesting--they are sick of excessive police force being used against people who have not committed crimes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Calling in military police for protesters is an unnecessary escalation.  Simply appalling. Worried people will be injured or killed as a result.  Please protest peacefully, wherever you are, and do not take bait from provocateurs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Before blaming groups for damage following protests, consider that DHS warned police that some may try to exploit protests and cause mayhem, as Politico reported. Here's another story about possible exploitation.   https://t.co/QAwmiK8YrB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just terrible. Warned of right-wing exploitation of protests, Trump blamed the left.  Now he's called up military forces to police DC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is beyond the pale. Trump must be terrified.  This isn't strength. Using the military for civil policing is anti-American.  Appalling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ongoing #GeorgeFloydprotest  in Urbana IL (Champaign's sister city).   https://t.co/j7VhU58ryt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In case you think that #GeorgeFloydProtests are big city phenomena, protests took place in at least 3 small central Illinois cities: Springfield (state capitol), Decatur, and Champaign. Some buildings were vandalized.  Peaceful protests resumed in those downstate IL cities today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good grief! America's cities are not "battlespace" and protests are not war.  Why is Esper even commenting on domestic events?  Makes me suspect Trump wishes to deploy the military in our cities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Trump had mentioned the Joint Chiefs, the suggestion of potential for martial law should have been clarified. Instead, McEnany fails to clarify.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly what's called for, and what a President would do given the nation's unrest: Speak with those on the front lines and offer encouragement and support.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you need more evidence that Trump wishes he were a dictator? He considers governors his underlings who should simply do as he says.  He never learned how to lead thru example and persuasion. All he has are the threats and demands of a man who feels threatened and powerless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, please, let's talk ab. the Flynn transcripts.  We know how to multi-task.   And those transcripts only make things worse for Flynn. Hardly exonerating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MMcHarry I am convinced that there are instances of coordinated efforts by some (and I don't know who) to make the protests look lawless when in fact protests were primarily peaceful (in our town, at least).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MMcHarry Over here the protests were peaceful and the looting occurred separately, by people driving their cars to places of business and storming doors, breaking glass, and stealing.  That looting appeared staged and deliberate, on the same days as protests, to implicate protesters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeidiNBC That was a shock to our family too. My disabled father, whose SS check was far less than my mother's, ended up having to live on substantially less from SS for the rest of his life--a fact that they had not prepared for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MMcHarry But on Sunday shows, it's not Trump who has the megaphone.  WHY aren't these people pointing out the obvious?   I mean, TODAY Trump is calling for a military crackdown (as is his little friend, Tom Cotton).   They're trying to use the #Floyd protests as a Reichstag fire.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MMcHarry I just do not understand this. At all. Trampling on the Constitution and the Rule of Law is Trump's main activity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Over and over again, in the back of my mind, this song keeps playing...but maybe that's because I lived it. #Ohio #Protest   https://t.co/p4XzBJh0OY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YIKES.   https://t.co/9u4H4cNQ4r<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This thread illustrates that Trump has NO understanding of Americans' rights to assemble and protest. (Just read and digest the actual words he uses.)  He has no right to be in the President's office without understanding Americans' rights under the Constitution. He is #UNFIT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In times of difficulty, a leader speaks and acts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Appalling.  Cotton is using the power of his position as Senator to advocate for a military takeover of the country.  It's an outrage that citizens should never accept.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vandalism seemed related to protest, but is criminal. Saw some of that here in our little town yesterday, by opportunists.  "Protest tourists" may be responsible for crimes, to implicate those lawfully protesting and delegitimize the impact of the #Floyd protesters. Disturbing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. Nixon did some of this during the Vietnam protest era, and there was popular support for suppression of protest.  Blame was heaped on ‚Äúhippies‚Äù, ‚Äúthe counterculture‚Äù, even college students in general. Protest groups were branded as ‚Äúanti-American‚Äù. Trump will try that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damning.   This Presidency is over. Trump proves he‚Äôs utterly inept and #UnfitToBePresident.  Again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So when the going gets tough, the President retreats?  ‚ÄúWhen danger reared its ugly head,  He bravely turned his tail and fled.‚Äù<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"The use of force by police sometimes seemed unconnected to any threat that they faced, and aimed at people who had little to do with the violent protests."  The culture of policing must change.  Citizens are not enemies. Policing is not war.  https://t.co/TghCfqykV4<|endoftext|>

Now he's showing us, again, who he is and what he's capable of, and people are staring off into space saying that they "never imagined" he'd be this bad.  Wake up. He IS that bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You may not have lived through 1967-68, when there were riots, murders of public figures, student unrest, and so much more, but I remember all of this.

<|startoftext|>As a result of these realities, I have become resigned to staying at home, possibly for the next two years of my life, if I am fortunate enough to live that long.

<|startoftext|>This whole thread, but especially this tweet.  Trump is trying to make the pandemic go away, b/c it's something he cannot control, he fears it makes him look bad, and it threatens his re-election. He doesn't care ab. deaths, except as a number others might blame him for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congress represents the people.  1. Oversight is always a necessity since this Executive branch regularly wants to operate in a corrupt manner.  2.

<|startoftext|>Thread. (And yet many states are "opening up".)  Has the US learned nothing? Is understanding contagion that hard? Do people really think they're immortal? Have we wasted our time at home?  Are we ready for another major outbreak? Seriously? #COVID19<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Agree. A majority returning to 'normal' will impact some of us.  It means that I, an elder w/medical conditions, will not be able to leave my home potentially for months (maybe a year), b/c there continues to be significant unseen contagion. #COVID19 #CoronavirusUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have to say this, since many apparently did not learn it at home or school, and it's crucial now:  &gt;&gt;With freedom comes responsibility.&lt;&lt;  Always and forever.

<|startoftext|>If you haven't already, read this story that summarizes the many ways in which #TrumpFailedAmerica during a national emergency involving a global pandemic. (His  administration is at fault too.)  It's informative, and infuriating. #COVID19 #CoronavirusUSA   https://t.co/dQWRNeE6bT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most importantly, Trump failed to act with urgency as soon as the outbreak was reported and failed to work with states to create a coordinated, urgent #COVID19 pandemic response.  Without question, #TrumpFailedAmerica then tried to pretend he hadn't. Instead his response was to:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of many admirable cable #journalists:  @NicolleDWallace . She is always extraordinarily intelligent, quick witted, incisive, well-informed, and fair.  Beyond reprehensible to call her childish names.  Grateful to have Ms. Wallace do the job w/grace and professionalism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not surprising that a guy who cannot get a security clearance, and the people he decided to work with, would bypass federal laws regarding transparency and conflicts of interest.

<|startoftext|>1. It's not over. 2. Trump failed to contain or mitigate the virus' spread; governors did. 3.

<|startoftext|>Trump straight-up lies. Can't have a test for a virus that didn't exist during Obama's admin.  Trump's administration failed to work with the WHO on #tests.

<|startoftext|>Been worrying ab. food since the pandemic began.  When you close down restaurants and schools, there's a &gt;predictable&lt; domino effect through the food #supplychain.

<|startoftext|>@reb_fyffe @arghavan_salles Yes, same. When we lost our daughter, several of the physicians who treated her even came to the memorial service.

<|startoftext|>Again, Trump makes promises but does not deliver...so whatever he says today is not credible. #TrumpLies  https://t.co/mImaCCIa4a<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nobody believes Trump. He makes promises and claims that usually have no basis in reality. (See Acosta's tweet.)  Governors have more credibility. Trump has none. #TrumpLies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This ruling applies only to the plaintiff in the case, not to a class. IOW, it currently applies to ONE PERSON at the present time.  Stay tuned as the Governor files his appeal.  #Illinois #StayAtHome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No one to blame but Trump and his administration for the late start to contain the #coronavirus.   They knew and they did not act with the necessary urgency. #TrumpFailedAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump's just going to whine, complain about and insult others, and then praise himself.  [If we don't pay attention, will he just stop doing them? Or will he pull outrageous stunts to get attention back?]  Trump is getting more tiresome every week. #TrumpPressConference<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump could be working to help people.  Instead he's whining on Twitter ab. his news coverage &amp; P.R. For him it's not ab. action; it's only ab. image. Poor Donald.  While 55,843 Americans died on his watch, he's offered no condolences at all.  Reasons why #TrumpFailedAmerica.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the most important and discouraging metrics: People we have lost to this horrid virus.  If you've lost a loved one due to #COVID19, sincere condolences. May your fond memories bless you.  Let this crisis always remind us: #TrumpFailedAmerica.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ü§£  The idea of Trump actually doing real work is hilarious.  The man watches TV and tweets half his day. His other pastime is skeptical remarks to actual experts. And he has lunch with Pence sometimes.  Not exactly a grueling schedule.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly.  Narcissists cannot stand being mocked. And the comments (even some people calling him 'stupid') were humiliating. THAT's why he won't do the press conferences and why he's been laying low; his defensive tweets are evidence of all of that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good thread to remind us that immigrants have provided this country with countless benefits. #Immigration<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Nope. @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer: Employers should not be shielded from liability for their conduct in shielding them from harm.  Workers should not bear all the risk during a pandemic while employers bear none. The inequality of this idea is staggering.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. Bail out airlines but not #USPS?  Trump never thinks. (Was going to add "strategically", since many of his voters are rural, but then...decided this is more accurate.)  https://t.co/Wwu2q6wJZI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disinfectants are safe if used as directed.  They are not for ingestion, ever.  Cannot believe it must be said: DO NOT DRINK POISONS. They will not protect anyone from #COVID19.   https://t.co/TKine4pCtD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously, Trump is a danger to public safety.  He MUST stop making rash medical recommendations.  #TrumpFailedAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a National Emergency, declared by the President himself. #USPS is a government SERVICE. Trump is demanding that Americans pay far more for mailing.  Trump should not be using the levers of power for unjustified purposes. Congress should be consulted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same for rural seniors who get their #SocialSecurity checks by mail. #USPS is a lifeline for rural communities.  Trump lives in such a bubble he cannot imagine the lives of others (IF he ever thought of them).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Again: Divestment for a Presidential candidate is essential to ensure that the President acts in the nation's best interests not merely his own.  Why isn't anyone asking about divestment plans? #Emoluments #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what a narcissist does when he's caught--claims it was somehow a joke and you're "too sensitive" or "too dumb" to notice. He's embarrassed and it's *your* fault.  [My dad was a narcissist. Cannot recall how many times I heard him use defensive attacks like this.]<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This man is a menace to society during a deadly pandemic.  The arrogance of believing that b/c he's President, a virus will be respectful of everyone in a room.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He waited a day before trying to walk back his absurd claims..."to see what would happen".  When a person of high rank promotes an unproven (and deadly) treatment? People try it and die.  Attorneys must have warned him ab. wrongful death lawsuits. #TrumpLiesAmericansDie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WH **alters** transcript in attempt to create an alternate reality.  Anyone who watched the briefing knows that Dr. Birx looked appalled and denied that what Trump promoted was actually a treatment. #COVID19 #CoronavirusUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't think I will ever forget this statement ("...failure by design"), b/c it is so difficult to believe yet so shockingly true.  As Rosen states, the problem isn't the truth of the statement, however. It's our continuing inability to believe it. Indeed. #TrumpFailedAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why has Trump promoted unproven treatments?  GOP is desperate for a quick #COVID19 fix so that  -people can return to work -the economy can recover &amp; -they can get back to campaigning b/c they have accomplished next to nothing in 4 years.  They want to pretend to be saviors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Definitely worth reading, if you're inclined toward the details.

<|startoftext|>Sobering stats.  By May 1, when many states' stay-at-home orders expire, where will the number of deaths in the US be? Have we had even 1 week w/daily falling numbers?  Seems premature to "reopen" in areas where social distancing is not practiced and masks aren't worn. #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some of these states "reopening" rely heavily on tourism for their incomes.  Thus people from other states will travel there, return home, enabling a greater viral spread.  If we had a federal government...ah, what's the use? #CoronavirusUSA #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Shaky futures"?  Sure, threaten the old, sick, &amp; disabled by eliminating a subsistence + healthcare during a pandemic that targets seniors w/pre-existing conditions.  Maybe all elders could just die at once to delight some lawmakers. SMDH #SocialSecurity #Medicare<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Even though the death rate is slowing, these numbers don't inspire confidence.  So, if businesses open 10 days from now in our town, when the stay-at-home order could be lifted, we'll still stay at home. We're in no rush to risk disease or death.  #CoronavirusUSA #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have not left our home since March 12 (just a quick drive in the car, to get the engine running and keep the tires from flattening out). (Um, 40 days and 40 nights at home. Sounds Biblical, doesn't it?)  Yes, that text would have to be a scam.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not just hospitality industry benefitted from the "small business" #PPP.  Beginning to look a lot like #corruption.   https://t.co/3K0NHAEJ1F<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's the meaning of "excess mortality".  #coronavirus #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnpavlovitz MLK and RFK.  I was a very young woman in the spring of 1968, and their deaths, so close together, shattered my life. Long story, but as a result of their deaths and the rest of that eventful year, I became more or less permanently alienated from family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. Local pubs, mom-and-pop retail shops, small hair and nail salons all cannot get loans. But somehow these huge companies managed to drain the #PPP pool.  Don't criticize me for surmising that big companies may have had inside information to help them.  https://t.co/lhacdstkAX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is no fundamental right to inflict others with a potentially fatal virus.  Most people can figure that out.  And courts have even ruled on the balance between individual rights and community safety.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"#PPP was designed to help the nation‚Äôs smallest, mom-and-pop shops keep employees on payroll and prevent mass layoffs across the country amid the coronavirus pandemic... Several of the companies [getting loans] have market values well in excess of $100M."  https://t.co/Gn87j5XmYg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many people are afraid and have seen nothing to convince them that returning to work isn't risky to their health.  The Trump administration has failed to persuade the majority of Americans that it's safe to "reopen" right now.  #CoronavirusUSA #COVID19   https://t.co/svAx7FeZQZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Know why your small business could not get a #PPP loan? The hospitality industry practically took over the program. And who's the captain of the hospitality industry (in his own mind, at least)? Trump.  Just like insider trading, this stinks.   https://t.co/4SZC61LGSb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Americans can never know the actual number of infected or the real numbers of dead--thru testing--b/c Trump is afraid it'll make him look bad + someone might say something unfavorable.  It's always ab. him &amp; his image, never ab. compassion for those suffering w/#COVID19.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG. Maybe it's not pretense.  Maybe Trump actually cannot remember.  Do you suppose he needs a memory care facility? Someone should notify his family. #UnfitToBePresident   https://t.co/94ZC44B0qn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump is trying to pretend that he didn't know he held rallies during a pandemic.  The absurdities never end.  Trump continues to be #UnfitToBePresident<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maryland's governor had to get his wife to help the state secure tests from South Korea.  Hardly "the outer limits". Trump had absolutely nothing to do w/this procurement. Trump talks big, acts small. He's incompetent, mean-spirited, &amp; #UnfitToBePresident.  https://t.co/w0Jrmi82rD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"People agreed with me at the time even though I was wrong"...  is no defense of Trump's failure at keeping Americans safe and helping the states get what they needed to diagnose and treat #COVID19 cases. #TrumpFailedAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have not purchased gasoline since before the "stay-at-home" order, in the second week of March.

<|startoftext|>@summerbrennan Thanks for keeping us informed ab. your progress. This illness seems like it lingers far too long. [I've had pneumonia for a month (asthmatic), but COVID appears far worse.]  It's miserable to be sick for such a long time. Hoping your recovery speeds up as time goes by.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Took my car out for a drive today, since I hadn't driven in...I can't remember when.  All I can say is: There are a LOT of people out. But maybe they're mostly driving their cars around, as I did, to help their vehicles recall why they exist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump was never interested in governing. He wants the IMAGE and the ACCOLADES that come w/the Presidency w/o doing the work, if possible.   Image is important to Trump b/c he is a hollow man,  dependent on what others think of him to affirm what he'd LIKE to think of himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Extremely minor annoyance:  TV commercials using the phrase "in these uncertain times". The phrase has rapidly become a clich√©.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The federal government usually provides aid to states during disasters and emergencies since many states have balanced budget stipulations in their constitutions.  State tax revenues have fallen b/c of this pandemic. But Trump refuses to help.  #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpResign<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Speaking with CNN's "State of the Union," Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, said it was "delusional" to suggest that the states have enough tests to begin reopening their economies soon." #CoronavrusUSA #TestingForCovid19   https://t.co/aIzUfKVFrO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow.  [I'd be thinking, "Will I treat you when you show up at my ED, man?" but nurses are better than that.]<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tests for #COVID19 prior to Trump's administration would not have been available, b/c #coronavirus emerged in &gt;2019&lt;. Can't blame non-existent tests from a previous administration when a new virus emerged during your own.  Trump's blame-shifting has become absurd. #CoronavirusUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Willing to bet those families "want their loved ones' lives back", too.  The risks some are willing to take with others people's lives is part of the insanity of these protests. A virus respects no party, no industry, no ideology, no border. #CoronavirusUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thread expanding on the federal govt's interception of states' #PPE. States, which often have restrictions on their budgets, are paying but then supplies are confiscated.  WHY are they doing it? WHO benefits? Americans deserve to know. #CoronavirusUSA   https://t.co/AP1nLHQD8N<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First Trump tells the states that they're on their own in acquiring supplies. Then, when they procure them, the Feds try to pirate them.  Illinois had to call up the National Guard to protect its shipments of #PPE.  Outrageous. Are we the UNITED States or not? #CoronavirusUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>50 days 40,000 deaths  Of all #COVID19 deaths in the world (164,891 as I type this), the USA has 40,495.  Almost **25%** of ALL #coronavirus deaths occurred in the USA, leading the world. #CoronavirusUSA   [And some people think they're being oppressed by stay-at-home orders.]<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We can't test if without the materials necessary to run them. This is a no-brainer. Does Trump offer to help get them? No.  The idea that the federal government has no role to play is absolutely incorrect. Bottom line: Trump is incompetent and #UnfitToBePresident. #CoronavirusUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We would never accept  "I'm responsible for success but not responsible for failure"  from any other President.  We cannot accept this level of failure from this one either. Trump is a failed leader and President.  #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpResign<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just to make it clear:  It was not the WHO's fault that Trump procrastinated and pretended there was little threat to Americans. It was Trump himself.  Even though he knew a fatal virus was circulating the globe, Trump failed to protect American lives.  #TrumpFailedAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The excuses this administration makes for its lack of preparation &amp; inaction are infuriating.  They knew LAST YEAR. And still Trump did next to nothing to contain the #CoronavirusPandemic in the US until it was widespread.  We deserve to know why. #COVID19  https://t.co/Iyz66fUiYX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump is #UnfitToBePresident. "We knew most of these things about Trump before Drezner published his book, but he presents a smothering avalanche of repeated presidential absurdity. The reader realizes that this pattern is not part of the Trump presidency; it is the whole thing."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So they want the "freedom" to inflict illness and potential death on their fellow citizens?  C'mon. There's money, power, and privilege behind these efforts and ordinary people are simply being used as pawns and "civil rights" as pretext.  #COVID19 #CoronavirusUSA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Watch this ad.  Trump failed to act. The US now has the greatest number of deaths from #COVID19 than any developed country.  Trump hesitated to do even the bare minimum.   #TrumpFailedAmerica  #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica    https://t.co/HBid2KFxAw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, 3.7M tests is a mere 1% of the population, which falls behind ALL developed countries.  This administration should hang its head in shame over the almost 40,000 deaths, many of which could have been prevented w/a faster response and coordination. #TrumpFailed #TrumpResign<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When we're diagnosing additional 200,000 cases per week, is THAT the time to relax social distancing?  Asking for a nation. #COVID19 #CoronavirusUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One direct effect of Trump's signature on the checks (as well as ... a lack of rational thought on the part of the person mentioned below).  Trump's signature never should have been on those checks. He always tries to steal credit, whether it's warranted or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also from the same Pew poll (conducted April 7 to 12 among 4,917 U.S. adults on the American Trends Panel):  "Nearly two-thirds of Americans (65%) say Trump was too slow to take major steps to address the threat to the United States..."  https://t.co/N5nYMt8Rs1<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KevinMKruse Love of ice cream cuts across political parties.  Sherbet's a different story. Just don't get anyone started about frozen yogurt and gelato.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you love to read, this thread will recommend many worthwhile books, particularly if you're looking for books that will stay with you for a long time.  I could never answer this question. Too many wonderful and talented writers and their life-changing books to choose just one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Old debate returns:  "It's my body. The government can't tell me what to do with it." (Say people in favor of relaxing social distancing rules.)  If it was only ab. you and you alone, fine.  But does anyone have a right to knowingly inflict disease on others? #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Until we know more about this virus and its impact on us all, we must be cautious in drawing conclusions ab. immunity.  Just because people recover from a #coronavirus infection, that does not necessarily mean they cannot be re-infected. We just do not know...yet. #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump always wants to take credit for successes (even when they are not his own) and shift blame to others when he fails.  But this botched pandemic response happened on his watch, is definitely his responsibility, and as a result, people died. #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpResignNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is very disturbing and sad.  The delays in developing testing caused by a simple (and avoidable) error--cross-contamination--led to greater numbers of infections. #coronavirus #testing #CDC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These are hardly "emerging".  They are planned and paid for by some PACs + business people who don't believe in science, have no interest in public health, and care only for their bottom lines (not yours). That Fox is promoting them is a key indicator.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The idea that a plateau in testing = a plateau of cases is absurd.  We do not test enough. So we cannot know how many cases are circulating, self-quarantining, asymptomatic, etc. This is a huge risk.  We need to test anyone who is symptomatic, yes. But also ALL their contacts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dereliction of duty seems an appropriate conclusion.  Trump's refusal to take responsibility while at the same time claiming he has the authority to reopen the country should anger all Americans. He's failed the leadership challenge.  #TrumpFailedAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IL Gov. JB Pritzker announced today that schools will not reopen for the remainder of the school year.  Trump doesn't know what he's talking about.  #illinois #schools #CoronavirusUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For those who think we're doing great on testing, look at where the USA stands among other nations in % of population tested.  We need to do A LOT better before we relax social distancing. (And this table doesn't address antibody testing...)  #coronavirus #testing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"New polling from Pew Research Center suggests that Americans are more likely to side with the experts than with Trump. By a 2-to-1 margin, they are more concerned that distancing measures will be rescinded too quickly than too slowly." #CoronavirusUSA   https://t.co/yZV0YVP9oi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Republicans want the economy to re-open but Trump admin. has washed its hands of testing capability, virtually assuring that people cannot or will not get back to work.  This "hands off" strategy is supposed to protect Trump from blame. But if he won't act, how is he blameless?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lessons I didn't want from #CoronavirusPandemic protests:  People feel invulnerable to invisible threats (contrary to science). Some never develop beyond  childhood, hold on to fears &amp; grievances tightly, &amp; embrace unacknowledged risks to rally for freedom to cause others harm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Retiree here, and same.  Without tests or vaccine, I'm #AtHomeForTheDuration.  #COVID19 #CoronavirusPandemic #CoronavirusUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We cannot claim that #COVID19 cases have plateaued when we've limited who can be tested.  We cannot claim we even know how many have been infected when we do not test unless someone needs to be admitted to a hospital.  Major pandemic response failure on testing. #CoronavirusUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The measure of Trump's sense of helplessness and desolation.  People are not serving his narcissism. Others aren't doing as he's demanded.  Feeling sorry for himself, to lift his mood, he must find people to disparage.  [My dad was like that. It's pathetic.]<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was my first thought, also, when I read that Trump failed to include Sen. Romney in his "council".  Romney was also involved in salvaging the Olympics.  Disdain and vengeance combine to explain Trump's desire to exclude real experience to help the country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is no federal response to this pandemic.  There's guidance. And daily reality shows. That's about it.  (Oh, and piracy. So Trump can dole out favors to those who kiss the ring and withhold them from his 'enemies'.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really, if you haven't seen this thread of industrious pets, you're missing something.  Their owners are going to have the best-educated buddies in the country. So impressive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Republicans generally have trouble running government. They love &gt;the feeling of having power&lt;. But they don't enjoy the nitty-gritty work of executing laws, creating policies, and following thru on details.  It's one reason FL is flailing. See story in this thread. #unemployment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course cross-state travel is going to cause outbreaks and deaths. That's why a FEDERAL response makes sense. But Trump refuses to act, and will continue to pretend the problems belong to the states.  Trump is and always will be #UnfitToBePresident. #CoronavirusUSA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's not a candle. There is no giant "virus snuffer".  #CoronavirusUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Trump thinks an NP swab is so horrible, he should ask others ab. their more difficult medical procedures. (Just the *prep* for my breast cancer surgery would've been too much for him.)  For a guy who claims to be so strong, he's showing what a wimp he is. #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@NBC estimated that ~2,000 people are dying every day of #COVID19.  Large gatherings could become major occasions for virus transmission. It seems premature, even irresponsible, to "reopen" the country when we cannot test everyone for the virus and for immunity. #CoronavirusUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure he can say that those rates won't go up if people are forced to go to work during a pandemic.   The anxiety of fearing your co-workers as vectors of illness could lead a person to bring a thermos of wine to work, for example. #TrumpPressBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As much as I admire #StaceyAbrams, I could not support her as VP. She has no federal experience, and this is no time to elect someone who's inexperienced for a job that's a heartbeat away from the Presidency.  There are more experienced candidates on the Dem. bench.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Open knowing that employees could be exposed to or expose others to a disease that can potentially cause fatal harm?  They want employees to take ALL the risks of harm? Who do they think will want to work for them?  The NLRB &amp; OSHA are the results of this unequal philosophy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>How long are they going to "discuss" this? Months?  "FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn told POLITICO on Tuesday the White House Coronavirus Task Force is continuing to discuss whether changes to the testing criteria are warranted."  Test everyone. #COVID19   https://t.co/iI8LHffPjL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The idea that a government can pretend a disaster is not happening &gt;to save face for its leadership&lt; while people are dying should outrage the world community.  Appalling during Chernobyl. Appalling during the #COVID19 pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Knowing this, would it be criminal negligence to have had the power to order social distancing but have failed to do so, thus causing a huge rise in cases + deaths (excess mortality)?  Asking for the entire United States of America...as a class. #TrumpFailedAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This story with its charts shows how stunningly different the outcomes can be w/early social distancing.  Difference b/twn KY &amp; TN of just a few days: "Applying social distancing one week earlier is associated with a 60 percent reduction in the expected final death count."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump will apparently do anything to try to blame-shift on #coronavirus but it's obvious that he and his administration simply could not protect Americans b/c they didn't think it was important.  When caught, they want to blame anyone and anything else. But #TrumpFailedAmerica.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For those of you who say, "We don't shut down the country for the flu..."  #COVID19 isn't like the flu.

<|startoftext|>Heartbreaking. Heartbroken for those who lost their lives and their families.  Government's first job is to keep citizens safe. Unconscionable, all b/c Trump &amp; his administration refused to act. They own these deaths. #TrumpFailedUs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Everyone is focused on his threat to leave. (As usual, childish.)  Horrified that he's denying the federal government's role in testing to quell a pandemic.

That's the choice:  Shut down &amp; bear the wrath of a hospitality industry, or Stay open &amp; bear an eventual class-action lawsuit for criminal negligence.  Neither may help w/re-election bids, but one is vastly preferable. #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listen.  If you're actually listening to Trump, you have a real problem. He provides misinformation, changes his story, denies he said things, attacks questioners, and, of course, lies. When he does tell the truth, you can't be sure that it IS truth.  So why listen to him at all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Illinois gets the wrong #MedicalSupplies #PPE. Yeah, sure, that was a "mistake"...  #CoronavirusUSA   https://t.co/vnm4kVGVFa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"The President knows Florida is so important for his reelection..."  THAT's why Florida receives priority when it comes to #MedicalSupplies from the federal government.  Politics over all American people. That's Trump's Republican party. #CoronavirusUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrierWHStaff Not watching the WH's daily Misinformation Hour.  They have not been accurately tracking cases since they haven't been able to test, have slowed the distribution of tests, and have been telling infected to stay home (untested). Any data they have is imperfect, at best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WCIA3 @Unit4Schools Would have been able to watch this news at 5 if @CBS and @WCIA did not preempt local news for non-informative and often misinformation-filled "updates" from the WH.  Not journalism to broadcast misinformation. We'll watch other networks until this stops.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ever since Trump has taken over my local news broadcast's half hour, I have had to turn to another city's local news.  Refuse to watch the Misinformation Show put on by the WH.  #CoronavirusUSA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wow.   Infrastructure Week has finally arrived.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just because someone has an ax to grind doesn't mean #journalists and #media have to become whetstones.  Likewise, just b/c Trump has a mistaken belief ab. something doesn't mean anyone must amplify it.   In times like these, we need facts and truth.  Nothing else suffices.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Trump says he ‚Äúhasn‚Äôt heard‚Äù about testing for #COVID19, the appropriate question should be:  ‚ÄúWhy haven‚Äôt you asked about that?‚Äù  Dodging responsibility shouldn‚Äôt be acceptable or accepted.  #CoronavirusUSA #TestingForCovid19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump admitting he could not multi-task is another addition to his overall incompetence.  His indifference to the lives and deaths of the Americans he was elected to serve continues to outrage those of us who have been paying attention. He is #UnfitToLead and #UnfitToBePresident.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. We cannot know exactly when the pandemic will end. It is disappointing that our ordinary lives must be postponed.  As an elder w/underlying conditions, I'm grateful for everyone who decides to stay home &amp; extend their temporary seclusion. Thanks. #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmartNYT @gregggonsalves @maggieNYT This is so dismissive. Beyond my comprehension. No one, not even a NYTimes reporter, is above reproach.  NYTimes WH reporters often seem defensively supercilious  whenever criticized. I find that attitude toward your readers offensive and decidedly off-putting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to a governor explain what his state needs, and then hearing a US President say that he hasn't heard anything about the problem the governor JUST described, sickened me.  Illinois' Gov. Pritzker said today, we're on our own. He's right.  Trump is #UnfitToLead. #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The daily "The Narcissist-in-Chief Demands Country's Adulation"-fest must be going on.  Still mystified that some networks carry it live. Definitely not #journalism when captains of industry attend merely to praise the Dear Leader, as if the US is an authoritarian dictatorship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gorgeous spring day here in central IL. Grass is greening, trees are budding, bulbs are showing their leaves, sun is out, it's 60 degrees. Dozens of neighbors out for a walk, warily #SocialDistancing. Reminds me of a very old song: "The Best Things in Life Are Free"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amandadeibert Learning to draw. Challenging yet relaxing.  (Also sometimes I draw my anxiety over the pandemic, and that is cathartic.)  Could not draw at all, as a young person. Somehow as a retiree, I am learning some things. Old dog; new trick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Truth. "...given the chance to prepare hospitals and health-care workers for the expected influx of #Covid_19 patients, the Trump administration did not take action to build up supplies of the vital equipment experts knew would be needed." #CoronavirusUSA   https://t.co/xFQ6y4bm0X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Starting to think that "people have been asking" in Trump-speak just means "Jared".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Speechless.  Trump wants credit for doing *something* rather than *nothing*--the lowest possible bar. Yes, it's important to prevent deaths. But even 100-200,000 is horrible.  And, remind us--when has Trump expressed sympathy to the families of the dead?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump does not understand what a pandemic means. He doesn't get the math of pandemics.  He has shown himself to be completely incapable of leading b/c of his incapability to fathom what he is asked to manage. He dithers b/c he *cannot* understand. #UnfitToLead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Extraordinary dedication. Thank you. #FindTheHelpers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[trigger warning] An ER nurse took this photo to show others that these refrigerated trucks are real and they are being used as temporary morgues.  We should not have to see these things. But we must not look away either. #COVID19 definitely kills.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's hard not to imagine that Falwell may have been thinking "I'll show my fealty to god-installed Trump by offering the sacrifice of my students".  And that makes my stomach turn.  Falwell's decision is responsible for the ill-health of dozens now...and more later. Immoral.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. We cannot find out what issues have arisen in our local communities b/c the primary networks have been preempting them with his non-informative "newsfests".  They should be called "The Narcissist Demands Your Adulation". And they should not be aired. It's NOT journalism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One thing I miss during this "stay-at-home" time: Baseball, especially our @Cubs.  Became a true fan before and after my hip surgery, when getting around was hard &amp; I was home a lot. Loved watching day games, even thru the painkiller haze after surgery.  This won't last forever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's a link to the article Trump quoted. It's an opinion piece in which the author discusses whether the networks should carry these pre-emptive "briefings" (they preempted my local news every day; turned them off, BTW). They're worthless. #journalism  https://t.co/LXwRCdbSPP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A note to @CBS, @ABC, @MSNBC, @FoxNews and any other network that carries Trump's daily... ramblings...   You're not providing a public service by airing his misinformation and lies. Trump's using you.  I want real journalism. Have you learned nothing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why we need to maintain #SocialDistancing.   "Opening things up" is a recipe for increases in cases and deaths.  #COVID19   https://t.co/PHkG6s9rvr  https://t.co/3dxwLWoOum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"In general, countries that test less and reserve it for those already very ill, like Italy, have higher fatality rates."  The blundering errors by Trump admin. and the CDC re: testing have caused more cases and more deaths. That much is obvious. #COVID19   https://t.co/QyBGp7f1Yw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Depends on assumptions plus containment or mitigation steps taken. Estimates by experts at the CDC outlined four scenarios.  W/steps taken by only some states, death estimates could be higher, since there's no national strategy. Worst case could be &gt;1M.  https://t.co/ejXVUmNhci<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No doubt #healthcare will become the primary (possibly the only) topic determining the November election. #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"The US response tells a different story. Two days after the first diagnosis in Washington state, Donald Trump went on air on CNBC and bragged: ‚ÄúWe have it totally under control. It‚Äôs one person coming from China. It‚Äôs going to be just fine.‚Äù " Wrong.  Major #TrumpFail  #Covid_19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What about "America First"?  Wasn't that a Trump slogan once?  Note that on Feb. 7 the State Dept. knew a widespread epidemic was coming. Trump had been alerted in January too.  Yet they failed to coordinate with states, Executive branch agencies, and private sector suppliers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep.  When you don't test, you can't know.  But we know the number of cases is far greater than reported, b/c some people are asymptomatic. And some have died w/o being tested as well. #CoronavirusUSA #Covid_19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And what about these beaches? This doesn't look like #SocialDistanacing to me. Just doesn't appear to be true that Florida (or Trump or its GOP Gov. DeSantis) is really concerned ab. this #CoronaVirusSA pandemic. #Covid_19   https://t.co/ajRafNnsxv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So there's no screening of New Yorkers traveling to Florida? Republicans just want to try to blame New York for the pandemic in their state, but not do anything to slow the spread?  #CoronavirusUSA #CoronaVillains   https://t.co/LP03xkAXks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. American know-how &amp; can-do spirit. (But who sends out broken ventilators?)  Anyway, happy CA is getting some of what they need. #CoronavirusUSA #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MMcHarry Good luck testing asymptomatic individuals ... even doctors can't get tested in some regions.  Thanks for the link, @MMcHarry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MMcHarry From that link: "...there is no clearly established standard for when individuals are infectious. So unless or until states can rapidly test asymptomatic individuals, it is unlikely that any court would be willing to question state officials‚Äô restrictions on intrastate travel..."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damning indictment of the Trump administration's failure to address the #coronavirus pandemic when they knew it was coming. Damning too of Alex Azar and others leading critical agencies. A cascade of failures that will lead to unnecessary deaths. #COVID19  https://t.co/avPjNNJg9T<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@foundin77 Not surprised at all.  De Santis should have had a "stay-at-home" order early but they're more worried ab. the economy than public health. Just now trying to limit travel but hospitality is a major industry, so he's been slow to act, which means it may be too late.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many New Yorkers have homes in FL.  Trump was one of them (until he changed residence) so they would be traveling to their homes.  [My folks lived 7 miles from Mar-a-Lago; I met numerous New Yorkers in south FL (aka snowbirders).]  This virus is everywhere; too little too late.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What he said. Absolutely essential.  Until we can know who has and who HAD this virus, we're blind in the face of #COVID19.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shows Trump's continued inability to act decisively.  Once it's too late to act, THEN he'll decide to do the right thing, costing American lives with his waffling.  #UnfitToLead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Prototype in just 12 days!  "Researchers at Carle and the University of Illinois have developed a prototype emergency ventilator that could help fill a commercial ventilator shortage across the U.S. due to the COVID-19 pandemic." #ventilators   https://t.co/VG3gjgvRaJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why yes; yes, it does.  It wasn't long ago that @RepAdamSchiff was outlining Trump's extortion of Ukraine to the House and Senate--and Republicans said, "What extortion? That's just politics." even when lives were at stake there as well.  Concluding that, to GOP, life is cheap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This thread is how you speak truth to power. (A real shame that his advisors can't or won't be this straight w/Trump.)  Well done, @maddow. And thank you.  #CorornavirusUSA #COVID19 #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every day a new outrage. Every day a completely corrupt administration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs a child who has to be convinced that he must go to school (he‚Äôs been fighting it). Eventually he comes around but not before whining about it for an hour and driving everyone nuts. He‚Äôs such a child. #UnfitToLead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amen. Until we have adequate tests, and test broadly, in all states, all numbers misrepresent the extent of this pandemic. #coronavirus #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, this is frightening, too.  #COVID19  #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Inadequate test supply means we CANNOT KNOW the actual number of cases. Inadequate medical supplies means we may be aiding the spread.  We may never know the extent of this pandemic. Hoping we can eventually get tests to show whether or not someone HAD #COVID19 and is immune.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not holding my breath on this one.  He's already proving himself #UnfitToLead by withholding materiel. He has failed to provide adequate resources--testing, medical supplies--to the states and failed to actually invoke the DPA. His communications are contradictory, often absurd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. Trump acts like he is &gt;personally&lt; providing for materiel to the states. The federal government BELONGS TO the people &amp; needs to act FOR the people, wherever they are.  We need to remember that a President is expected to be the &gt;steward&lt; of resources, never their owner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We can also thank the Army Corps of Engineers who often coordinate these efforts. Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite spoke ab. these kinds of emergency efforts over the past week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, they will.  Cutting #SocialSecurity #Medicare &amp; #Medicaid is a standard, go-to ploy for Republicans.  There's always enough for the rich &amp; corporations. There's never enough for the rest of us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Usually do not swear on Twitter but WTAF? Trump proposed putting troops on our northern border as a guard against a VIRUS?!?  I keep saying that Trump is #UnfitToLead and #UnfitToBePresident but he's proven himself too mentally feeble now. He must #Resign.  https://t.co/raRKwKld0M<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hate to yell, but...  NO ONE KNOWS HOW MANY #COVID19 CASES THERE ARE, BECAUSE THE USA CANNOT TEST ALL WHO COULD BE INFECTED. We don't have test kids adequate to demand. Asymptomatic people are still infected.  Reporting case numbers is completely misleading. #CoronavirusUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you, @SenKamalaHarris, for stating the truth about the situation.  The Executive branch is failing Americans. Trump has shown himself #UnfitToLead. #CoronavirusUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MMcHarry I think he's also worried that the economic impact could derail his re-election campaign.  He actually wants to get the spotlight back on himself, personally. Keeping the focus on a VIRUS, instead on on Trump, galls him. He's also mad that the media isn't praising him daily.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Aawojo @StevenBeschloss I hear this from my Republican relatives who watch Fox News:  Trump's doing a great job. No regrets whatsoever. Now "people need to get back to work!", echoing the GOP talking points. They're not afraid of this "mild virus". They're only worried ab. their retirement accounts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What words can't Trump understand? pandemic?  infection rate? death toll? social distancing? flatten the curve?  Does he know how ill #COVID19 patients can get? Has he even visited a hospital?   The idea of "opening up the country" before a peak is reached is nuts. We're doomed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump has long been known as #UnfitToLead, but during this crisis, he won't just pout &amp; whine ab. how everything is "unfair" to him. He'll cause people to die that could have lived, to get revenge on perceived enemies. Appalling that he can use the levers of state to do so. This:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Keep hearing from some relatives that Trump "is doing a good job".  If it's so great, why are we still unable to get tests in our state, still unable to serve all the sick in our hospitals, and especially why are medical personnel without the equipment they need to do their jobs?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My neighbor was laid off yesterday. A single woman ‚Äúof a certain age‚Äù. Imagine losing your healthcare along with your job during a pandemic. #CoronavirusUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump won't even care what party the governors are from. They will become his scapegoats, as if he had no responsibility to lead the country.  HIs narcissism + sociopathy require that an external force must be responsible. He can't psychologically bear the burden. #CoronavirusUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Trump's trying--again--to divert to something else in order to deflect from his administration's lack of foresight, preparation, and execution, while the #COVID19 cases increase exponentially and deaths occur faster than the pandemic he's complaining about. #TrumpFail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@maddow interviewing Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite is great.  Watched his presentation the other day. He is a no-nonsense, solutions-oriented man. Watch and listen to his approach.   Imagine if the team around Trump sounded as competent and focused. Everyone would feel more reassured.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still shocking.  Prevention saves lives. It's disturbing that we have to endure more cases, and deaths, to convince Republicans that social distancing is actually necessary. #CoronavirusUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nobody accepts China's numbers at face value.   So there's that.  But cases are increasing exponentially worldwide. It doesn't matter where--thousands of people are getting sick, and many are dying. We need increased testing, treatments, and a vaccine ASAP. #CoronavirusPandemic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People should pay attention to #COVID19, even if it's hard to see how it affects you personally.  If you can't fathom any of this, to appreciate what it could become, watch #contagionmovie. Yes, it's fictional. But this virus is very real and 10x more deadly than flu.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. Thank you for this succinct summary.  Now, news organizations, just repeat it as necessary.  No need to air his news conferences again. #TrumpNewsConf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do we even report this? He's whining again.  What he wants--and cannot get in a democratic republic--is universal praise every day, like some autocratic dictator.   Stop indulging his childishness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly what I mentioned earlier today.  #unemployment #healthcare #healthinsurance  https://t.co/sZ9NEPgydS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Truth may be harsh but it's preferable to this administration's fantasy any day.  Cannot deal w/something unless you know the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watched #ContagionMovie last night. Read @EmilyMandel's excellent Station Eleven when it first came out. Loved it but recommend waiting if you haven't read. Don't need more entertainment like that right now. My mom spoke ab. '30s films--kids, dogs, romance--to lift ppl up. Yep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So much bad news (+ excellent commentary) that it's tough to keep up. So many worthy stories.  Trying to tamp down the worry listening to music and drawing, the only real comforts &amp; solace for me right now besides family. Hope you &amp; yours are coping well. #CoronavirusUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Industries that try to avoid US taxes but want a big US handout...  Around here there was a furniture store that kept moving to avoid local taxes. When the store had a fire, the city fire dept. sent trucks--to protect the city. They watched that store burn down to the ground.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wish I could say I was sorry about this but honestly, they register w/other countries to avoid US taxes. Yet when they're in dire straits, they want a lifesaver from us.  Not feeling too sympathetic. #cruiseships<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Definitely showing that the US will surpass other countries if we keep up the current trajectory.  #CoronavirusUSA  #COVID19  #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Testing hasn't been increasing as fast as they told us it would. If we don't continue to use social distancing, we will only make things worse.  "It is a false choice to say that we must accept the deaths of senior citizens to keep small businesses going."  https://t.co/Ybng3UIeYm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely correct.   https://t.co/bBKsQuQgC5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THIS. üíØ%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@brikeilarcnn wanted to know if the administration can become prepared for the current + looming crisis. Navarro won't address that. Instead, he wants to waste time blame-shifting and rewrite history.  This administration cannot take responsibility for its inadequacies. #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably a waste of time and misunderstanding of the scope of the crisis.  Once they release people from "stay-at-home" orders, they will travel to jobs in other counties, as one example.  The only useful reason for classification would be as targets for disaster aid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please read this important piece in  @nytopinion. It contains an interactive to show how social distancing and #COVID19 infections interact.  We're likely to endure periods of economic disruption for  some time in order to bring it under control.   https://t.co/Ybng3UIeYm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's one less thing to worry about during #LockdownLife:  Home security. Never think about burglars while we're away, b/c we're always home. Never consider getting that "Premium Service" from a home security company either.  So there's that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reminding everyone that record numbers of unemployed people may not have healthcare now.  So...that $1200 check they'll get from the government may seem rather paltry compared to the lack of healthcare if they get sick.  Healthcare should NOT be tied to employment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A neighbor stopped by yesterday while walking her dog. We love her dog and the dog practically dragged her to our door.  From a safe distance we visited briefly so she could tell us she'd been laid off.  Just one bookend to these horrific jobless numbers today. #unemployment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the two measures of his Presidency that Trump repeatedly bragged about  1. stock market 2. unemployment  hit records--record losses in the first (on 3/23/20) and record job losses in the second, today. And those measures were sudden and dramatic.  Seems ab. right. #TrumpLosses<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cannot say 'Thank You' enough to @NBCNews and @CNN for making this decision.   Americans are exhausted from being forced to listen to Trump's misinformation and lies on a daily basis when real news should be broadcast.  Much appreciated!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't think #journalists and #media understand what a disservice they're doing. They pre-empt our local news to broadcast disinformation--the opposite of what a free press should do--and they give a madman free rein to ride roughshod over the truth. Just stop. #TrumpPressConf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Make these televised Trump rallies (aka 'press conferences') stop!  They provide no real news. They're just megaphones for Trump's misinformation, exaggerations, and lies.  Please, stop televising them unless there's real news. #TrumpPressConf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepKatiePorter Hoping your results are negative.  Even those of us who are not in your district have been very impressed by your work in Congress.  Feel better soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McFaul Yes.  Here's one poll.  https://t.co/GlyZR6Jn2O<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People want to work, but cannot due to a crisis. I doubt these Senators even know what it's like to live and work in a minimum wage job and get bills paid. But Senators resent giving them temporary relief pay due to job loss/furlough not their fault.  Unconscionable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Americans understand why a #lockdown is necessary. They were even polled.   We realize that it's not about the election. We know it's a public health emergency.  https://t.co/o9igxwAOnc<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@beagle_betsy That's been our experience too, here in our little enclave. Many smiles. Lots of dogs. And many waving to one another. But little conversation up close.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What @GovPritzker implied...  #CoronavrusUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have seen more people walking (w/social distancing) during the day in my neighborhood than ever (and I've lived here for 20+ yrs).

<|startoftext|>Literally had to change the channel so I could avoid the inevitable program interruption showing Trump lying again to the public.  What is wrong with our media that continues to carry this man's ramblings and rants when we're in the midst of a pandemic he refuses to address?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Counting on Twitter to fill me in on today's televised Trump Rally [aka #CoronavirusUpdate].  Cannot watch or listen to the man repeatedly lie to the public, as he does with every public appearance. Just can't do it. #COVID19<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"For one-third of these cases, no information was available about whether the patient had to be hospitalized. More than half lacked information on whether the patient required treatment in an intensive care unit." Shocking. We need better data! #COVID19   https://t.co/6PfKvugBgP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Won't be any different in the US.   We're behind Italy by ~10 days, and we won't have enough medical equipment to treat everyone, just as they did.  Our governors and mayors are valiantly working to get help. But Trump's administration drags its feet every day. #CoronavirusUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is an excellent thread. It shows how dire the consequences could be--for all--if we don't continue  social distancing. Only one quibble: We can know what the case fatality rate is at a given moment in time; the problem is that it's a moving target until the pandemic is over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If citizens could sue the Trump administration for criminal negligence &amp; malfeasance, we'd have a countrywide class action suit for its failure to prepare for #COVID19, since they knew it was coming &amp; failed to prevent a widespread outbreak + numerous deaths. #CoronavirusUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump ceded responsibility for the pandemic to state and local leadership. They're in charge now. He's kibitzing from the sidelines, blaming or trying to take credit for their successes.   Never seen such ineptness at the top in my life. Trump is simply terrible. #CoronavirusUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When we say, "Don't listen to what Trump + administration says. Watch what they do." What you do shows where your values are.  This is an example of what we mean:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This claim is one of Trump's worst b/c he's trying to weasel out of responsibility for lack of planning and preparation.  Intelligence agencies tried to warn him. People in his admin. tried to warn him. Trump refused to listen.  #COVID19 #CoronavirusUSA   https://t.co/ElbUQrNwdy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Worse:  -6 of Trump's 7 most-revenue-generating properties have had to close. -3 of Trump‚Äôs hotels have outstanding loans from Deutsche Bank (but are lagging in revenue) -He can't hold rallies. Thus: No adulation on a regular basis.  He's in a panic.  https://t.co/zRDtGCAKsB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NOT THE SAME.  Argument by analogy works in some cases, but don't compare apples and oranges. #COVID19 isn't influenza--its characteristics are not comparable. Automobile accidents bear no relationship to a pandemic.  Just b/c you can count things doesn't mean they're the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sickening:  Promoting the idea that elders (and others who may die of #COVID19) be offered as sacrifice to the god of money.  Have never heard such value-less and soulless commentary in my lifetime. My parents, of The Greatest Generation, would roll over in their graves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My thoughts exactly.   Now it‚Äôs ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs sacrifice the elders to the gods to get our money back!‚Äù   Quite the principled Republican Party you‚Äôve got there.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>THIS is why Presidents must divest their assets prior to taking office, and why they should have no financial interests in stocks, bonds, real estate, and other assets they can manipulate during their tenure.

<|startoftext|>Thanks, Dr. Birx, for reminding older people w/conditions that, when Trump lifts stay-at-home orders, we still won't be able to leave home...for months? B/c infected younger people will be everywhere, including in the very clinics &amp; pharmacies where medical care occurs. #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We did KNOW "this" cold happen.  We had a pandemic response team. Trump's people eliminated them. Several Cabinet members also participated in planning events if something "like this" ever happened. Trump lies again. #CoronavirusUSA #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump just reading from a document from the lectern during this press conference.  Doesn't he have a press secretary to do this?  [I know he's trying to get a spotlight on himself, b/c of his narcissism, but it would seem his time could be better spent.]<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember that Dr. Fauci noted that the #coronavirus remedy Trump mentioned has not been widely tested and its effectiveness has never been confirmed.  There are no cures for #COVID19 right now that have been found safe and effective. This is why we test drugs first:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After all, they always deny what they're doing and then do it. Like this.  https://t.co/d5rbclKbqY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There has to be some kind of election donation scheme behind this, from corporations and wealthy business people, who no doubt want to be beneficiaries of the Mnuchin slush fund.  McConnell has a slush fund of his own, you know, and doles it out to GOP candidates loyal to him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guaranteed that customers would patronize businesses where workers were publicly sanitizing frequently-used items over those that don't.  Right now we carry wipes and sanitizer in the car for these very shopping trips--and we wipe down every grocery item ourselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Americans won't be able to get tests but Trump's offering them to his "friends"?  "The United States won‚Äôt be able to test broadly for the coronavirus for ‚Äúweeks, if not months,‚Äù Severin Schwan, CEO of Swiss diagnostics maker Roche, told CNBC on Monday."  https://t.co/TqpZeKYl46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This man has an MD! He should have known better than to go on a "feeling" when there's a pandemic. Instead, he potentially infected everyone he spent time with.  Paul demonstrates the utter height of irresponsibility.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And by "really?", I mean I'm shocked by the 47% who don't think their lives have been impacted. Guess most people think they have, as one relative told me, "a strong immune system", so they might get sick, but they'll get it over it. I can never have that confidence. #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really? As a senior w/asthma, I can't be sure I won't end up very ill (or even die) from some unwitting stranger standing beside me in a pharmacy line. My life may never be 'normal' again: always at home, ever afraid of others, incl. my partner who still works. #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump fails. "...what is being done is plainly insufficient. At a time we need federal leadership to direct production and take over distribution, Trump is AWOL. What he said was being done is not really being done. What he 'hears'‚Äîthere is no mask shortage‚Äîis blatantly false."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And in case you're wondering...  Retirees are extremely worried about both their health and the economy, b/c we're watching our life savings--the $ we have to live on--be reduced every single day.  But we may not survive to use those savings if we get #COVID19. So...there's that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Umm, yes. What he said.  https://t.co/m7o4gc3PAt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had to tell my brother (Republican), in harsher terms I've never used before, to stop telling me that "everybody needs to go back to work to stop the economy from tanking". We're both retirees. He's a smoker w/COPD (and I have asthma).  And...Now we're not speaking. #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A test to know whether someone's had #COVID19 is precisely what's necessary for "normalcy" to return.  If we could know they are immune, they could go back to work and go about their ordinary lives without worrying they'd infect others.  Sooner the better! #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AMEN.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No $500B slush fund for Mnuchin. Ever. That's why Democrats are opposing @senatemajldr's bill.   Two years ago McConnell was gleefully trying to take healthcare away from ordinary Americans. He's not worried ab. them--he wants the slush fund to advance. #GOP #hypocrites<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dog_rates Diva (l) and Christmas (r) both shelter dogs. Christmas was picked up by the shelter, sick and limping, on Christmas day (thus her name); smartest dog I've ever known.

<|startoftext|>How this sounds to people of middle America, afraid of a deadly virus, afraid of losing jobs, afraid of not making bills:  Trump's self-pity shows all he cares about is himself and the wealthy, while ordinary people could lose everything they've worked for, even their lives. Soüéª<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolute non-starter, @SpeakerPelosi.  Why should anyone getting taxpayer money be allowed to hide who they are &amp; what they got? Accountability must be built-in.

<|startoftext|>Trump was never interested in governing. He wants the IMAGE and the ACCOLADES that come w/the Presidency w/o doing the work, if possible.   Image is important to Trump b/c he is a hollow man,  dependent on what others think of him to affirm what he'd LIKE to think of himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unbelievable.  Taxpayers are not giving Mnuchin a blank check to play with, and share w/his billionaire friends.  Good grief.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Why does anyone watch the daily press conferences on #CoronavirusUSA?  These "advisors" have little information. What they transmit is often misleading, exaggerated, or even false. Not reassuring.  The only people who are qualified to inform are Dr. Fauci and Dr. Brix. #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is terrifying.  Where's the urgent financial aid for them, Congress? Forget airlines and hospitality...Healthcare first!  #Hospitals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They've given up on containment. Now: "slowing disease transmission and averting excess morbidity and mortality".

<|startoftext|>IOW, it was all for show.  When will Trump take the severity of the #CoronavirusPandemic seriously?  How many people have to die?  How crippled does our healthcare system have to get?

<|startoftext|>States, municipalities, and companies stand ready to step up and help w/this pandemic.  But the President is dragging his feet, even after announcing that he would use the Defense Production Act...then walking it back.  WHY?  #CoronavirusUSA #COVID19   https://t.co/ewDhSnB2dF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doesn't @SpeakerPelosi live like ordinary people? The public has to pay bills each month: -rent/mortgage -power, water, sewer, trash -loans (car, student, home equity) plus -childcare, tuition -credit cards -other bills  Tax credits next year? NO!  Direct help now. #Quarantine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now we're sewing hospital #PPE from discarded materials. American ingenuity, yes.

<|startoftext|>To be fair, he's suffering from at least one mental disorder, and possibly a neurological one as well.  But rather than rein him in, he was fully enabled by the GOP and Fox News.  Let's do better next time. Elect someone who will manage national crises for all of the people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another example: We are crowdsourcing medical masks, because Trump‚Äôs administration thinks it‚Äôs every locality for itself‚Äînot the federal government‚Äôs responsibility to coordinate these urgent needs during a pandemic. #coronavirus #PPE   https://t.co/oj5pbQJiMC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One example: Minnesota governor says they don‚Äôt have enough tests, but Trump administration promised millions of them. Minnesota‚Äôs situation is not unique.   Trump promises, but can‚Äôt deliver. Repeatedly.  #coronavirus #COVID19   https://t.co/2Ald6XHC08<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, they announced ‚Äúactions‚Äù that were‚Äîat least so far‚Äîfictional.   If they had any credibility left to lose, it‚Äôs gone now.

<|startoftext|>Appropriations begin in the House. McConnell knows he‚Äôs upending the process, trying to wrest control from Pelosi. Utterly transparent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Media outlets need to stop covering them live.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hard not to speculate that some officials purposely procrastinated in order to give themselves time to profit while others‚Äô lives were in the balance. Senators used insider information to sell stocks while government dragged its feet to manage the #COVID19 epidemic. Criminal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump always wants to pretend that difficult events are not happening.  &gt;Don't release cruise travelers off the boat b/c he didn't want to "increase his numbers" &gt;Don't release unemployment figures b/c he's afraid of market turmoil  This administration doesn't like reality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This looks downright sneaky and evil: Taking healthcare away from people during a pandemic. Explain yourselves, #Republicans.  #CoronavirusUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Until we can get our healthcare system what it needs to combat this virus, we should not be worrying about the hospitality industry. Health &amp; safety come first.  If doctors don't have what they need, we're in trouble.  Let's get them supplied, @SpeakerPelosi and @SenSchumer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An increase in the number of cases of #COVID19 probably means we've increased our capacity to test, an excellent development. Don't relax social distancing now.

<|startoftext|>@CitizenCohn They don't think it's the federal government's responsibility.   This commentary by Azar shocked me. We're in the midst of a crisis, and I guess the GOP thinks it's every locality for itself. #CoronavirusUSA   https://t.co/RgmNQA9dRM<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The US should accelerate test kit manufacture (following the President's invocation of the Defense Production Act) and then test as many people as we can, as often as we must.

<|startoftext|>Trump has repeatedly called the press "the enemy of the people", which was irresponsible every single time he said it. He's canceled daily press briefings.

<|startoftext|>After the past week, I just stopped watching any event featuring Trump speaking. The Rose Garden speech did it for me, w/his corporate mannequins and denial of responsibility. These are PR stunts.  Journalists, I appreciate your attending and providing summaries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A round of thanks for all doctors, nurses, EMTs, and other medical workers who are doing everything they can to protect the sick and the well.  (One of my doctors' offices called today to proactively reschedule an appointment for a non-emergency evaluation.)   Thank You!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's applaud the nation's governors and mayors who have stepped up during the leadership void in the Executive branch of the federal government.  Thus far they have been proactive and steadfast in doing what they can to protect public health and safety.  Thank you, @GovPritzker.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>As I noted, a virus has no politics.  The handling of a pandemic does potentially have political impacts, though.  And this poll shows how shockingly partisan Trump's management of US response has become. #coronavirus #COVID19    https://t.co/JlErp0LWX9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This thread is essential reading on #COVID19.  I had no idea that Trump had placed tariffs on medical equipment, items we need during this #CoronavirusOutbreak. Trump put caregivers and first responders at risk w/these tariffs.  #CoronavirusUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A virus knows nothing ab. politics.   Spread will overwhelm the healthcare system, as it did in other countries, b/c so many people don't take it seriously until it's everywhere.  [You can't imagine how terrified this makes me, an elderly person w/asthma.] #coronavirus<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Reposting this, b/c it's hugely important:  &gt;You can have #coronavirus w/o symptoms and spread the disease to others. THIS is why schools are closing...and why businesses may close as well.  Since we don't have enough tests, please stay home. #coronavirus   https://t.co/iSIJHvUINo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is also #Illinois.  Governor knows that we need to #FlattenTheCurve. All schools closed beginning Tuesday. And he'll take further action as necessary.  Better to be criticized for being too cautious. The alternative is more cases, and potentially more deaths. #coronavirus<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is Trump‚Äôs fault. He didn‚Äôt consider the logistical and psychological implications of a travel ban, again.

<|startoftext|>We cannot afford to risk public health and safety by electing people who don't "believe" in science and expertise ever again.   Science doesn't care if you believe in it.  Failing to act is why we're here.  And this virus is a killer. #coronavirus  #COVID19  #CoronavirusPandemic<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Repeating this in case anyone in my feed needs to the help.  Also, way to go, @uhaul!   #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A reminder that it was **2018** when the pandemic response team was disbanded.  -&gt;Trump claimed to know nothing ab. it and claimed he was not responsible yesterday. #coronavirus  #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Utterly amazing that, by underestimating news + warnings about a coming global viral epidemic, Trump put himself, and everyone around him, at risk of infection.  Ignoring expertise has very real consequences. #coronavirus  #COVID19 #CoronavirusPandemic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's Gov. Pritzker's short announcement regarding school closings in the state.  #IllinoisSchoolClosings #coronavirus  #COVID19  #CoronavirusOutbreak   https://t.co/rO37Be7FSk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Illinois Governor Pritzker just closed all schools in the state from Mar. 17-30.  "No school district will see their state funding cut as a result of this action," Gov. Pritzker. #CoronavirusOutbreak  #COVID19  #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This.   https://t.co/8M73GlKwkk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is irresponsible.   And it shows that they don't have the emotional, technical, or intellectual resources to answer plain questions or to give Americans truthful information. #TrumpAddress  #COVID19  #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yesterday a physician in our community said there are NO test kits here. Doctors have to ask for permission from the state; results in 3-5 DAYS.  "These are not point of care tests," says one of the doctors in the Rose Garden.  So...no local tests.  #TrumpAddress #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump denies he was responsible for closing the pandemic office in the WH, illustrating his failure of leadership again.  He IS responsible for the closing of that office.  #TrumpAddress  #coronavirus  #CoronavirusPandemic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly.  #TrumpAddress #CoronavirusOutbreak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump says he does not take responsibility for the lag in #coronavirus testing. Dr. Fauci says the system was not designed for surveillance and testing without the private sector involved.   But I don't feel reassured by their responses regarding testing.  #TrumpAddress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pence praising the Dear Leader is content that deserves my MUTE button.  #TrumpAddress #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Business leaders giving infomercials from the Rose Garden during an national emergency.  Very disturbing.  #TrumpAddress #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is Trump's "Look how many important people I know."  It's also terrifying b/c Trump and Pence were recently with two of Brazil's leaders who have tested positive for #COVID19.  #TrumpAddress #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dr. Fauci is the only person standing in the Rose Garden right now with the expertise to talk ab. the national emergency.  Having business leaders speak there isn't helping whatsoever. I don't feel reassured by them.  #TrumpAddress #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OK, talking about how long it took to develop an HIV test isn't reassuring me about #coronavirus--quite the opposite. #TrumpAddress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the heck? Trump sounds seriously worse than usual.  #TrumpAddress #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why the Trump administration has no credibility during this crisis:  They lie to the American people. Every single day.  Ordinary people have to get truthful information from experts, scientists and physicians, and journalists we can trust. #coronavirus  #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #CoronavirusPandemic isn't Trump's fault.  The US response to the outbreak IS Trump's fault. He disbanded the office that could have prepared. He refused to let testing be developed early + reduced funding for public health.  It's Trump's failure of leadership. #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Again, the Trump administration chooses the opposite of the correct approach to managing the #CoronavirusPandemic.  If you want to reduce an epidemic, you provide healthcare--you don't deny it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For anyone minimizing the threat of the #CoronaVirusPandemic, read this.  If we don't act, overwhelming hospitals seems likely.  We must do our best to reduce the numbers of infections, AKA #FlattenTheCurve. #coronavirus #COVID19USA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Americans deserve to know why sports teams can get the tests that doctors cannot get to test those they suspect may have #coronavirus. In our community there are zero tests.   Only the rich, famous, or connected can get tested? Seriously?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Governors, mayors, health departments, other local officials, and businesses are working together for the common good. Individuals are taking precautions for themselves and their families.  Neighbors phoning neighbors. Encouraging. This is the America I know &amp; love. #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emmersbrown Physician in our town said on TV tonight that there are NO tests here. (We have two major clinics and two hospitals.) He advised not going to the ER if sick (except for chest pain or breathing issues). Only state health dept. 90 mi. away can order #coronavirus tests.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So far, people are going about their lives . But  anxiety is almost palpable.  I mean, how often do you get an email from your bank asking you to use their app rather than visit a branch?   We are in a holding pattern, here in the middle of the country. For how long? #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Employers that can manage 'work from home' options - some have already decided to send those workers home for two weeks (or more, TBD later).  Others are waiting to make that determination.   #CoronavirusPandemic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Elementary and high school closings will be up to local districts, since there is such size variability in our state. Superintendents and school boards are evaluating the situations now.  #CoronavirusPandemic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>State colleges and universities in our state will hold classes online after spring break. Some students do not know if they will return to campuses.  This is a good thing, too. Public health is most important. #CoronavirusPandemic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The governor has mandated that all gatherings of people in the state over 1,000 be canceled, and requested that all events involving &gt;250 also be canceled.  More revenue for Illinois gone.  Public health is far more important. Much to my relief. #CoronavirusPandemic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A local film festival has been canceled. A local marathon has been canceled. A high school basketball tournament will have few spectators. All the business from these events...gone. #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Local hospitals and clinics have no #coronavirus tests, so do not just walk in and expect to get tested if you're sick.  Call your primary care provider for advice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got email from the local library about cancelations to services and programs.  The bank wants us to use apps as much as possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember when they warned about "significant disruptions" to our lives from the #CoronavirusOutbreak?  They're starting here, even with no diagnosed cases.  I live in a community, pop. ~250K. Some announcements...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A doctor from a local clinic, interviewed on a local news program: There are NO #COVID test kits in our town (pop 250K). A doctor recommends to the IL Dept. of Public Health do a test; IDPH decides if the person "meets the criteria". If tested, results in 3-5 days.  Unacceptable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Numbers are just for those who were able to get tested.  [On @MSNBC earlier today, a physician explained that she was denied a test for a patient she felt qualified.]  The number is likely multiples of these, simply undiagnosed. #CoronavirusPandemic  #COVID19<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The ONE THING everyone wants from their government is to keep people safe. Not just military or police protection.  Protection from public health emergencies.

<|startoftext|>Three people  in the spirits aisle of our market were discussing how "overblown" the #CoronavirusPandemic is, in their opinion.  People, please take this seriously.

<|startoftext|>This is beyond irresponsible. It's negligence.  #CoronavirusPandemic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About #Illinois colleges and universities: The University of Illinois System, Northwestern University and Illinois State University all announced Wednesday that classes will be moved to online formats for several weeks.  #CoronavirusPandemic   https://t.co/25WWQNk0ay<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>-&gt; Believe the experts and scientists. &lt;-  As governor of Indiana, Pence caused an HIV epidemic b/c his ideology got in the way of believing the science. He's as unreliable as Trump on health information.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right now, our economic situation is responding to the failure of leadership in the White House.  We cannot mitigate the economic impact until we get the #CoronavirusPandemic public health emergency under control.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So governors and mayors must join together to develop those plans, at least until Congress can pass a plan to address the #CoronavirusPandemic. Until we have a coordinated effort, though, the outbreak will worsen.  Each of us must do our part to practice preventive measures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a nation, we cannot just "tough it out". We need strategic and tactical plans to address the complexities of the #CoronavirusPandemic.  As of right now, it appears that states and cities are on their own. Trump could declare a state of emergency and free up funding. He won't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Making sure that testing and supportive care are widely available is the test the Trump administration has been failing.  They're trying to deny that there's a crisis and promoting the idea that all is going well. That is not true.  But they could do better.  #CoronavirusPandemic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The utterly absurd idea that there is a tax solution to a public health emergency should illustrate how badly Trump + his Republican enablers are handling the #CoronavirusPandemic.  First we must get the health emergency under control. Then we can manage an economic response.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, Trump is not responsible for the #CoronavirusPandemic.   He is responsible for the slow, broken response to the outbreak in the United States.  Trump is failing and people will die as a result. #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The crisis we're in currently is a direct result of:  -this administration's skepticism of science + expertise -Trump's narcissistic focus on the impact of events on him personally -Republicans' sycophantic enabling by  of Trump's delusions  We must reverse course on all three.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When we have a President who has eroded the public trust, the public and the world doesn't and cannot believe what he says. His speech caused further erosion.  Fortunately, officials outside this administration are generally taking scientists and physicians seriously. #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ridiculous.  In our community we have drive-thru flu clinics, after which your electronic health record is updated and your primary care physician is notified.  Drive-thru #COVID19 testing could occur the same way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Trump administration doesn't think things through. At all.  People with expertise have been sidelined, while people with zero experience managing pandemics advising Trump.  This is a public health failure, a leadership failure, a Presidential failure. #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not reassured whatsoever by Trump's address on #COVID19.  #CoronavirusOutbreak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Governors may need to coordinate among themselves since the Trump administration seems unable to identify what they need to do to manage a public health emergency.  #COVID19  #CoronavirusOutbreak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What were Republicans thinking?  If people don't have sick leave, they'll go to work.  If they go to work infected or sick, they'll infect others.  If they infect others, some will get sick and die.  Everyone needs sick leave. #COVID19  #coronavirus    https://t.co/wOLqa04tNE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watch Dr. Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.  Don't panic.  Do what you can. Take necessary precautions. Take care of the vulnerable.  #COVID19  #CoronavirusOutbreak  #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nepotistic response to a public health pandemic. Trump believes only people loyal to him can be trusted. Our collective health now depends on Kushner's lack of expertise.  Not confident I'm going to survive this. You?  #COVID19  #CoronavirusOutbreak  #CoronavirusPandemic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two downstate Illinois cities will hold their St. Patrick's Day parades on Saturday.  One problem: Rain mixed w/snow that day.  Bigger problem: #CoronaOutbreak precautions should preclude large gatherings.  Do what you think is right, central Illinois.  I'll be at home. #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because our federal government is refusing to provide information about what the WHO has begun calling a #COVID9 #pandemic, governors will need to coordinate and transmit information to the public, bypassing the WH.  A tragic failure of the Trump administration. #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you are young and healthy, you have no idea how terrifying this estimate is to the vulnerable.  With a 1-2% fatality rate, hundreds of thousands could die b/c healthcare facilities will be overwhelmed. We are not prepared for this.  #CoronavirusOutbreak  #coronavirus  #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Among the most vulnerable (elderly, w/asthma) to #COVID19, I must say:  By procrastinating over &amp; mishandling this emergency, Trump's government is treating my life as EXPENDABLE.  Classifying info is unacceptable. #CoronavirusOutbreak  #coronavirus    https://t.co/hlEZVCJPkj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is getting more real daily.  If you don't already follow it, check out the hashtag #FlattenTheCurve to learn why quick action is essential.  The time to act in the US was yesterday. But let's do all we can TODAY.  #COVID19  #coronavirus  #CoronavirusOutbreak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This case wasn't about "thousands of men". It was about one man who leveraged his wealth and power to prey upon women's dreams for his own sexual conquest. 87 women accused #Weinstein of sexual predation or rape.  Let's be concerned for women.  https://t.co/xolnhLMBsN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As important as it is to know how extensive the #CoronavirusOutbreak is, remember that testing has been delayed or omitted due to the lack of availability of tests and the stringent testing criteria outlined by the CDC.  We really do not know how many cases there are. #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone should know that the numbers will quickly double, or worse.  Practice good hygiene. Stay out of crowds.   And, please, protect the vulnerable by doing your best to stay home when sick or when exposed to the sick. #COVID19 #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Justice for victims of predators has been a long time coming. Wealthy, predatory men can no longer consider women as toys to be used and discarded with impunity. Hearing a collective shudder among them as #Weinstein's sentence is handed down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been promoting the same kinds of disclosures from candidates since before the 2016 election.  And yet here we are. And Trump is the worst offender.  We must reassure the nation that candidates are in good health, can pass a security review, and won't work only for himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Losers don't usually get to dictate terms to winners. How does Sanders supporter logic work?  Democracy gives voters the chance to choose what kind of candidate and policy platform they prefer. Voters rejected Sanders in most of last night's primaries.  #DemocraticPrimary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only response is to take the #CoronavirusOutbreak seriously.  In order to prevent an epidemic on the scale of 1918-19, the US needs to act--NOW. Petty political concerns can wait until we have stabilized public health and addressed the economic fallout from #COVID19.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So...just because it seems like there "aren't that many" #coronavirus victims doesn't mean it's no big deal.  This article explains why "things look fine until they don't". #COVID19  #CoronavirusOutbreak    https://t.co/YIU6dXcu5X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>James Carville needs to stop talking about "shutting this thing down", b/c ALL voters need to be respected and have their votes counted.   Now is the time to unify the party not shut anyone out.  #DemocraticPrimaries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump says anyone who needs a test can get a test. Hospitals and clinics say they don't have the test kits they need. Someone is not telling the truth.  We cannot get a health emergency under control if people cannot be tested. Period. #coronavirus #COVID19 #CoronavirusOutbreak<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Look what we could do to reduce the numbers, if we tested as South Korea has done. #COVID19  #CoronavirusOutbreak    https://t.co/wNAODvNpKV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This means NOT restricting people from getting tested b/c they don't meet stringent criteria, and quarantining those who test positive.  Containing a virus that is deadly and has no treatment or vaccine should be government's first priority.  #COVID19 #CoronavirusOutbreak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crazy. Trump cannot comprehend why stocks are tanking, so he's blaming media.  "Trump thinks that the stock market can be manipulated by media coverage, so he believes that the press is conspiring against him to manipulate the stock market by reporting on the #coronavirus."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are large political rallies still happening during a virus epidemic?  All the candidates for President are among the elderly, who are most at risk from having serious illness or death from the #coronavirus.  Seems like virtual events would make more sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Update on the #coronavirus situation in #Illinois from the Governor.  Thread. #COVID2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Introverts are thrilled. [Can't we handle that thru text message? Oh, OK. Fine. Quick FaceTime chat.]  But extraverts are unhappy. [Dang. No working lunches? No team outings? How're we going to get anything done?]  LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About the #coronavirus incubation period:  "Current estimates suggest that symptoms of #COVID19 usually appear around five days on average, but the incubation period may be as short as two days to as long as 14 days."  #CoronavirusOutbreak   https://t.co/Hj3pTUZ3Ae<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because he's incapable of handling a crisis like this, Trump should step aside. He's only going to make things worse b/c of his incompetence.  #TrumpResign    https://t.co/3XgfuUVjZh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After noting that Pres. Obama would have been teleconferencing w/world leaders over this pandemic:  "We are finding out in real time what it's like to not have a responsible person in the Oval Office." -- Ben Rhodes @brhodes on @MSNBC  #coronavirus  #COVID19 #CoronavirusOutbreak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When has he ever taken advice, even as the #CoronavirusOutbreak spreads, oil prices fall, and the stock market triggered a 'circuit breaker'?  Does he even have expert advisors who can help?  No. Only loyal partisans + college students. #TrumpResign<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No longer shocked. No longer appalled.  Time for him to resign. He simply doesn't know what he's doing. His understanding of the economy is so rudimentary that his solutions will only worsen whatever he tries to 'fix'. And the rest of us will suffer.  #TrumpResign<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why the threat of this virus should not be minimized, even if you are young and healthy:  Health systems could become overwhelmed, and you or your loved one(s) could find themselves w/o care.  Take precautions. Listen to medical advice.  #coronavirus #COVID19 #CoronavirusOutbreak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tax cuts for the rich will not help anything. Repeating: Tax cuts for the rich will not help anything.  The kind of stimulus that would be needed must help ordinary people, not "trickle down" from the wealthy, which has *never* worked.  #economy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you're looking for #coronavirus information, guidance from medical professionals is your best bet.  Start here:   https://t.co/iTJq2AVyDh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Current government officials could learn what NOT to do during a pandemic by noting what did not work during past ones.  Take the 1918 flu epidemic. This short article illustrates serious yet avoidable errors made then, which could inform today. #COVID19   https://t.co/lIGIJfY0dQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #COVID19 statements &amp; recommendations are intended to help the public cope with &amp; keep everyone safe during what appears to be a pandemic.  They are not intended to "make Trump look bad" or "take Trump down".  It is a public health emergency not a political situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This could be the basis of a class action lawsuit.   Causing the illness and/or deaths of numerous elderly persons isn't just an "oops". Their decision was &gt;purposeful&lt;. Negligence, dereliction of duty, malfeasance. #coronavirus  #CoronavirusUSA  #COVID19   https://t.co/2x097AfQxR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The US cannot afford to keep these officials in charge of its public health. Their "missteps" will have serious consequences for Americans, in terms of health, job security, economic impacts, and more. Worst of all, some people will die.  Expertise and competence matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can we mute Trump?  He's ... not helping anyone or anything; he's only making the coronavirus situation worse.  [Prefer to have him resign, but muting might be an important step.] #CoronavirusUSA  #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally a little practical advice for people at higher risk.  #CoronavirusUSA  #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AhmedBaba_ Zero. If it could be a negative number, I‚Äôd go with -100.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump‚Äôs unbelievable opinions never fail to shock me. A ridiculous statement. Thread on his CDC visit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump‚Äôs so scared he‚Äôll be blamed for it and people won‚Äôt vote for him that he‚Äôd rather people get sick or die than do something about the crisis. Appalling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When a man lies all the time, who believes him when he tells the truth (if he does)?  Trump has lost enough credibility that the American people cannot trust his word.  How can the United States re-elect a President that the people cannot trust to be honest w/them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's call this what it is: Profiting off the Presidency.  Isn't that what Republicans want to smear Biden with? Once they open the Pandora's box of #Corruption, the Trump family will be fair--and profitable--game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bernie Sanders is now running an "us vs them" campaign,  when Democrats most need a unifying message. Very much like Trump--a divisive populist. Unacceptable. His tweets, ads, and supporters have turned me off completely.  Since Warren has dropped out, I now support @JoeBiden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that we must rely on "helpful threads" should alarm us.  We should be getting daily updates w/vital information from infection disease doctors who work for our government, such as the CDC and Dr. Fauci of the NIH.  Another way Trump is failing us.  https://t.co/gkg36qONGK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree.  https://t.co/XasJCyhEmK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As an elderly person w/underlying health conditions, I'm not comforted or informed by ANY of the Trump admin's communications about the #coronavirus outbreak.  They acted late &amp; did not take seriously. Few test kits. Poor coordination. Misleading info. Trump is failing.  #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden will endure the same mud slinging toward his campaign. Sanders doesn't care if he damages Democrats, or how his attacks affect the general election.  And Hillary's right ab. him--Sanders has been in politics for decades but has no real record of achievement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who can believe Trump's claims that he'll protect #SocialSecurity and #Medicare? He just said he'll cut entitlements *yesterday*.  Cutting healthcare and Social Security are McConnell's + Republicans' goals, so Trump will go along. He's use them as bargaining chips. #VoteBlue2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree.  People appear to be longing for a return to decency, empathy, and character. Biden represents all of those, and it's part of his appeal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthewamiller @EricBoehlert His narcissism requires praise. It's the **appearance** of doing something that matters to him, something that a PR team can tout; whether it makes any difference to the issue is irrelevant.  Trump is concerned about perception, not reality: It's ab. how he thinks he looks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG. Thank you, @maddow and @MSNBC     And thanks to all the commenters who posted photos of their (D) pets! Great thread!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes. Everyone should watch this.  Thank you, Ms. Maxwell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Trump administration is beyond incompetent. Appalled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just saw, on a local TV station, a new and very effective #Biden ad, in which Obama praised him for his efforts as VP.  Probably out there to counter the (deceptive) #Sanders ad that includes Obama.  #Democrats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Repeating myself:  -Goal #1 is defeating Trump -Goal #2 is keeping the House -Goal #3 is taking the Senate  As #Democrats we must do what it takes to achieve those goals. Without them, we hobble our efforts to enact  progressive policies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RBReich Many of us are so disturbed by Sanders and his supporters that we will have to think long and hard before placing our support behind him. It's not ab. policies and programs; it's truly hard to get behind another divisive cult of personality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pick a race. Make a donation.  #FlipTheSenateBlue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very sad to see @ewarren leave the race. She has been a great candidate and an inspiration to many. Hoping she plans to remain in the Senate, where we need her voice. Thank you for a great campaign, @SenWarren.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many Boomers remember what it was like to be young, idealistic, and defiant. We endured recessions (1969-70 &amp; 1973-75), racism, + other ills.

<|startoftext|>And, if the Hunter Biden issue is central to Trump's re-election strategy, it would be irresponsible for journalists NOT to write and talk about #nepotism in the Trump White House.   All of Trump's children, as well as the Trump Org, are benefitting financially from his tenure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Factchecking Sanders‚Äô Obama ad.   https://t.co/894ad5ieGK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IL Health Department has also launched a statewide hotline, 1-800-889-3931, &amp; hotline email, dph.sick@illinois.gov, where residents can ask questions or report a suspected case. #COVID„Éº19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can we please elect a President who‚Äôs in touch with facts and reality?   My health and survival, as an elderly woman with pre-existing conditions, shouldn‚Äôt be at the mercy of Trump‚Äôs hunches. People are going to minimize the risks and more people will die as a result.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saw Sanders' new ads on TV here (IL) today--both the Biden attack ad and the (deceptive) Obama ad.  Those appeals did not change this retiree's mind: He's divisive; his attempts to smear Biden will fail to build a coalition that can win in the GE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now seeing the Sanders ad with Obama, appearing locally. Such a deceptive ad, making it seem as if Sanders had been a big Obama supporter and suggesting that Obama may have endorsed him. (He didn't.)  If Sanders had wanted to alienate voters like me, these ads do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just saw an attack ad on Biden by Sanders, on one of the local TV news broadcasts here. That was quick.  Guess the Sanders campaign anticipated that Biden might give them real competition.  Illinois doesn't vote until Mar. 17. #VoteBlue2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even when you‚Äôre retired.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"More than 27M people in the US do not have health insurance, according to US Census data. Workers in that group may put off getting medical treatment because they are concerned they can‚Äôt afford the bills, said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When people cannot afford to miss work and have no healthcare, the Trump administration is fighting in court to invalidate the Affordable Care Act, and there is a pandemic:  "Fragile safety net leaves U.S. economy vulnerable to coronavirus hit"  https://t.co/J9AqdOePOS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks, @Jeopardy, for posting Alex's update!  We're glad he's has reached this important milestone in his treatment. Here's to the next one!   [I'm a cancer survivor myself, so I know how reaching these milestones feels.]<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump actually wants those who have money to lend to take very little in return--he'd like to have interest rates near or below zero. It definitely benefits his business, and the interests of big borrowers.  Unnecessary + irresponsible. He's incompetent at running our economy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Leslie4848 Don't blame you one bit. Since it's almost certain that they're lying, I'm not sure we'll have to worry about it. üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG. This thread of Super Tuesday (and more) analysis.  The more I think ab. it, the more I agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@MikeBloomberg should shift his ad buys to Biden in the upcoming states immediately. He's already purchased the spots; just substitute new ads for the candidate he's decided to back. Especially important in AZ, FL, IL, MI, OH, PA, WI.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly my experience w/Warren v Sanders.  No one I know who supports Warren would vote for Sanders in the primary if she dropped out. They plan to vote Biden instead. Why? They see Sanders as divisive, unable to build the coalition to win. And winning the Presidency is goal #1.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bloomberg's campaign shows at least two things: -A candidate can't avoid voters and run advertising alone to generate support -A candidate can't simply buy a Presidential election  These are good things. Pundits will draw additional lessons from the Bloomberg run.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bloomberg is ending is campaign, according to @MSNBC just now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree w/Rothkopf's reasoning in this thread. -Goal #1 is defeating Trump -Goal #2 is keeping the House -Goal #3 is taking the Senate  As #Democrats we must do what it takes to achieve those goals. Without them, we hobble our efforts to enact  progressive policies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3 days? Count me skeptical to the nth degree.  Sure hope #journalists and #Congress heard this and hold their feet to the fire.  The lying of Trump administration officials is so legendary that it's hard to believe any of them. #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MMcHarry In other words, verify. üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This doesn't give me more confidence in this administration, either.  #COVID19  #CoronavirusUSA   https://t.co/49a8bb9KA8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As an elderly person with multiple pre-existing conditions, Trump's comments about the #COVID19 pandemic in the US make me even more nervous than I would have been without hearing them.  #CoronavirusUSA    https://t.co/7vLugFKZ59<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly why people are concerned ab. the Trump administration's mere public relations response.  Not calmed by phony reassurances without details.  #COVID19  #CoronavirusUSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Without broader testing, infected people will be going about their lives, infecting many others.  C'mon. Get it together, @VP, response coordinator.

<|startoftext|>The actual CNBC headline from the story above, updated at 2:30 pm ET is:  "Dow drops 950 points after the Fed cuts rates, giving back more than half of Monday‚Äôs surge"  Yes it surged; yes, it dropped. Yes, volatility is a problem, and caused by panic in the WH. #StockMarket<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad to say, this volatility was entirely predictable. It's a direct result of Trump's pressure on the Fed to "do something" b/c he's panicked ab. an economic downturn hurting his re-election chances.  #StockMarket  #CoronavirusUSA   https://t.co/hcWhuVboU0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously: Abolish Daylight Saving Time.  It saves nothing and messes with circadian rhythms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Prediction: These moves will shake the markets further, under the assumption that such big moves this early mean that Trump and his economic advisors know things the public doesn't.  Expect volatility from stock markets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ill-advised and premature. Trump's trying to prop up the economy so he won't take a hit at the ballot box in Nov. Rate cuts won't do it. Neither will consumer tax cuts when the deficit is at an all-time high.  Trump's walking an economic tightrope.  https://t.co/o2xGyljqQ5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, #journalists and #pundits.  There are 4 potentially viable candidates in this Super Tuesday race: Biden, Bloomberg, Sanders, and Warren. Many more on the ballots.  Viable candidates deserve mention. Don't handicap the race. Just sayin'. #SuperTuesday<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>No one is ‚Äútaking‚Äù the primary from Bernie. If voters think he‚Äôs the best candidate, he‚Äôll prevail. If they prefer someone else, then Bernie should graciously accept the outcome.   That‚Äôs how democracy works.   Stop spinning conspiracies. #supertuesday2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very irritated that Bernie implied that there's a "corporate elite" is out to get him.

<|startoftext|>This article describes me, too, a lifelong Democrat.   I'm a retiree who recalls the defeats of liberal presidential candidates &amp; who thinks Bernie is mostly a complainer w/o real plans (just sketchy promises that he won't be able to get through Congress b/c his record is scant).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Recall "the boy who cried wolf".  After lying to everyone for tens of thousands of times since his first campaign, now Trump wants us to believe that he and his administration can handle a #pandemic and that everything is under control.  Trump has squandered all credibility.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People struggling to breathe from #COVID19US think it's serious. (As an elderly asthma sufferer, I know that ANY respiratory illness has the potential to take my life.)

<|startoftext|>@MMcHarry Of course not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exhausted by hearing that everything Trump doesn't like is a conspiracy against him. His paranoia affects the nation's well-being.  He needs to stop whining, "man-up", and take responsibility for a change, instead of constantly blaming others for problems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha ha ha. Nope.  If Trump loses, he's going to whine about how "unfair" it was on every network that will listen. He'll hire people to write political "obituaries" or have someone write his "oral history", claiming that up was down and down was up. Trump's not a 'fade away' guy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How did we get to the point where #Democrats allowed 3 people to run for its nomination for the Presidency -A man who's never run for any public office -A former Republican -An Independent They want the party's nomination, funding, &amp; support.

<|startoftext|>Have to say that tonight's moderators failed to do the job, and the final question was ridiculous.  @CBSNews, your journalism lost.  #DemDebate  #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tired of all the yelling too. But Sanders' fury turns me off completely. I also prefer "Obama cool".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Steyer on Trump administration:  "21st century warfare is cyberwarfare." and "We're under attack, and they're not doing anything about it."  Somebody had to say this, and say it plainly and forcefully.  #DemocraticDebate  #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just yelled at the TV: "Shut up, Bernie!" (Have never done that before. And I *never* say "shut up" to anyone.)  Sanders keeps talking over Mayor Pete w/o allowing him to respond.  The rudeness just got to me.  #DemocraticDebate  #DemDebate2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warren is right. Financial disclosure -- and divestment plans -- should be requirements for candidates.   We must eliminate the kind of corruption indicated by Trump's emoluments violations again.  #DemocraticDebate  #DemDebate2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MMcHarry Have already identified a specific emigration location, should that happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would really like to see better moderation and MUCH better questions after this break.  Half temped to turn off @CBS' #DemDebate2020, since this has been the worst moderation in a long time.  Very disappointed in this group of journalists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bloomberg claiming he won the last debate made us laugh out loud.  We don't need someone to lie to our faces. We have Trump for that. #DemocraticDebate  #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every time I hear Sanders make promises without details, I think, "Trump made a lot of empty promises, too." His record of achievement is thin.  Candidates must convince me their agendas could actually be implemented and reasonably paid for.  #DemDebate  #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sanders tried to dodge a direct question on guns by deflecting to what he says were "bad votes" by Biden.  We're watching. We see what candidates are doing. It's hard to hide deflections.  #DemDebate  #DemDebate2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amy cogently bringing the #DemDebate to bring it back to the risks of the current administration.  "It matters if you can actually get things done," she tells the audience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching the #DemDebate and it's a bit of a free-for-all. Moderation simply isn't working.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How I view Trump's failure to fill crucial positions in our gov't:  My brother once noticed files on his computer that he did not understand; deleted them. They were part of the operating system. Then he was confused ab. why the computer didn't work.   Yep. Trump's like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This chart alone, from the link above, shows why I'm skeptical of a huge bump in youth turnout if Sanders is nominated.  https://t.co/mjkgwS9yUa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rosenberg's whole thread.  Sanders hasn't been completely honest with voters. His list of achievements is thin. He refuses scrutiny over his heart attack. His financial transparency? Slim. Not a Democrat. Not a convincing candidate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump claimed that "we are very close" to having a vaccine. A year (or more) is not "very close". People will die in the interval.  Don't listen to what they say ab. the pandemic.  Watch what Trump actually does.  #CoronavirusOutbreak   https://t.co/YsARFHXrvG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this:   https://t.co/hD8wGDUmBd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As I've said repeatedly:  Don't listen to what they say; watch what they do.  We have a worldwide #coronavirus pandemic.   Trump did this:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LillcyTweets I am old enough to have canvassed for George McGovern's campaign. I'm a retiree who watched the far left get slaughtered in 1972, even while Nixon's impeachment investigation was ongoing.  I want a candidate who can win. If you don't like my posts, just block me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LillcyTweets Nope. Read the linked story. If you're happy with a candidate who praises US adversaries and overlooks human rights abuses, fine. But I cannot stomach that. We've seen enough of it from Trump. Sorry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why wasn't Bernie fully vetted long ago? Stories like these could have been written during his 2016 campaign. Imagine how Republicans will use them should Sanders become the nominee.  https://t.co/FatkysuaBD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes indeed.  ‚ÄúAs Americans head to the polls in 2020, the question of whether women can be elected to lead at the highest level is the wrong question to ask; it has already been answered. Instead, they should vote for the best person for the job, whoever he or she may be.‚Äù<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This has been my experience. Sanders--and his online army--cannot handle being questioned, but the Presidency gets harsh criticism. He needs to be forthcoming w/voters on issues, his health, his finances.  As Truman said, "If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sanders had claimed any toxic online conduct was by 'a handful' of ardent supporters or bots.   Yet this article alleges that a Sanders *staffer* has conducted aggressive, even vicious, negative attacks against Democrats.  Disturbing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These numbers show Sanders' weakness. Older people always vote in much higher numbers than younger ones.  Thread.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amateur genealogist here.  Most of the people I've researched who immigrated to the USA could not have passed a wealth test. They came here for opportunity, built businesses, and contributed to their communities. That's the America I know and love.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bernie's not the only pro-democracy candidate, @RBReich. Neither is he the only candidate who detests oligarchy.  Do not forget Warren @ewarren: -CFPB -Grilling bankers in the Senate  Sanders was nowhere near those real programs and events. Where are his achievements?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>McFaul explains why the claim that Trump is "tough on Russia" is generally false.   He should know; he's the former  ambassador to Russia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Sanders spokesman on @MSNBC failed to convince me ab. their "movement" / "revolution". I must be too dense this morning. Or maybe I'm simply too old to entertain that notion. I've heard that song many times before...even rang those bells in the early 1970s.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@60Minutes And then there's this, which will no doubt appear in Trump's fear-mongering anti-Sanders ads.  Bernie may not be viable for the general election. He has not been fully vetted by Dems.   https://t.co/ZY3c11mtHl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@60Minutes Two-thirds of members of Congress have not bought into Sanders' agenda. He's known for not passing bipartisan bills.  How do voters think he's going to achieve his agenda w/o legislators on board?  Very worrying to this Democrat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sanders on @60Minutes admitted he doesn't know how he'll pay for his sweeping agenda: Medicare-for-All, free college, cancel student debt, free childcare.   He doesn't know how much those programs will cost. How can he propose methods for payment?  GOP will have a field day w/it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This piece on cheating speaks to me viscerally. Powerful people, no longer content to contend with 'worthy opponents', instead must cheat to win.  We're been mourning the loss of virtue--fairness,  courage, generosity, humility--in society, esp. as the GOP chooses to cheat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The country elected a guy who literally jailed children who tried to immigrate here from Mexico. Some of them are still in 'detention centers', separated from family.  He broke every promise he made to voters.  Let's choose differently this election year.   https://t.co/CRaWitRDjd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True. Many progressives prefer and support @ewarren.  Sanders' supporters seem to paint any differences with a very broad brush.  Most Democrats regardless of their preferred candidate want healthcare, economic security, national security, immigration reform, gun policy reform...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The lack of comprehensive vetting of Bernie should concern Democrats. The GOP will have a field day fear-mongering ab. him using just a handful of stories from Sanders' past.  Read on.  [Messenger here; don't shoot.]<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now that government employees must be Trump loyalists, we can never know if spokespeople are telling us real information or just telling Trump what he wants to hear on television, whether hyperbole or fantasy.  That is a loss for We, the People. One of many in Trump's America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been searching for this info all morning.  How many voters actually voted/caucused in the Nevada Democratic Primary? Of the Democratic electorate there, what percentage does that number represent?  Anyone know? Anyone can point me to those raw numbers? Just not finding it myself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When he says only Trump-believing loyalists can serve in his government:  &gt;Believe the autocrat.  And believe him when he says it's "his" government. To him, the bureaucracy is there to serve HIM, not the American people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump longs to be an autocrat--a dictator with complete control of government. And what is the first rule of living in an autocracy?  &gt;Believe the autocrat.  When Trump says he wants to be around for more than 2 terms, believe what he says. He will definitely try to. Not a joke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WatchMarquee "Dedicated" is laughable. Not adding another streaming service just to watch 1 team.  Fans are angry that channels we already got w/our cable package lost out, leaving us w/o options to watch our team. No Comcast deal. No fans. No one to watch Marquee.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump administration admits that Trump welcomes foreign interference in US elections b/c   &gt;GOP needs help to win elections &gt;GOP can't trust voters to choose their representatives or President &gt;Republicans do not believe in our democratic republic or the Constitution  Disturbing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Why aren't ALL Americans up-in-arms over foreign election interference?  Senate Republicans proved they don't care when they let Trump skate after his impeachment over Ukraine.  WE, the people, should be the ones to use our votes to put candidates in office, not foreign nations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IOW, the point is to -split Democratic voters and divide the party -nurture grievances among supporters of different candidates  -sabotage the primary Thus some voters will simply skip voting, in the primary or GE.

<|startoftext|>Loyalty to the man isn't in the oath our public officials take. Neither is loyalty to a party.  They owe their loyalty to the Constitution and to the Americans for whom they work. A President is not a king.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This entire thread shows why I'm supporting @BetsyforIL for IL-13.   @RodneyDavis does not deserve our support for another term in Congress. He has disappointed our farmers, our industries, and our educational institutions. He is a Trump sheep. #VoteBlue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump's administration violated the Constitution. Again.  "A federal judge in Arizona has ruled that conditions at U.S. border holding cells operated by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency violated the Constitution."  #VoteBlue   https://t.co/iKlZxMOiaK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why has foreign election interference fallen out of the news cycles until now? We knew that Trump would continue to welcome it if the Senate did not remove him.   Now: Trump's more upset that it became publicly known than that it's actually happening. #ElectionSecurity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thread.   Sounds like there's a lot of concern. Perhaps the interpretations may differ. Still @JohnBrennan sounds alarmed, which concerns me as a citizen. And...  Recall: the Republican Senate has rejected 3 bills to ensure #ElectionSecurity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Republicans must be fine w/this b/c they did not take the opportunity to remove Trump for encouraging foreign interference in our elections when they had the opportunity.  And none of them is speaking out against it now.  It's up to us to protect democracy. #ElectionSecurity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So no immigration whatsoever for Trump‚Äôs America. Got it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Extremely disturbing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What?  Comparing &gt;actual judicial proceedings&lt; to imaginary, fictional ones is not how we determine whether justice was fairly administered IRL.  Trump's proving that he cannot adequately distinguish  fantasy from reality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Arizona race is one to consider.  McSally's challenger is Mark Kelly: "Capt. Mark Kelly is a retired U.S. Navy combat pilot, engineer, and NASA astronaut. He lives in Tucson with his wife, former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords." #FlipTheSenate   https://t.co/0AG6Mk8THm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to an Economic Policy Institute report, "wages at the 95th percentile grew by 4.5% last year, while the median increase was just 1%."

<|startoftext|>@DanRather For the first time, clear differences among candidates emerged, and we narrowed our choices last night. Gave $ to one candidate and will do the same for another.

<|startoftext|>Resonating today after #DemDebate   @PeteButtigieg: "Let's put forward somebody who's actually a Democrat. We shouldn't have to choose between one candidate who wants to burn this party down and another candidate who wants to buy this party out. We can do better."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last night's #DemocraticDebate helped our household eliminate candidates. First time that's happened.  Still undecided but we're closer to ready to face our ballots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Governing experience is the relevant qualification.   The President is not a CEO with god-like powers (altho Trump is trying to make it so); s/he must wrangle Congress to get things done and work w/in the law.  Appreciating business &amp; its needs is relevant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A.B. Stoddard on @MSNBC just asserted that nominating Sanders would be "an unmitigated disaster" for Democrats and the country, assuring Trump's re-election b/c the GOP will pound him on socialism and compare the US under Sanders to Venezuela.

<|startoftext|>Democrats: We must flip the #Senate.   No Democratic President will enact his/her programs w/McConnell running the Senate. As Majority Leader, he's proud of his "legislative graveyard".  Support challengers to vulnerable Senate seats in AZ, CO, GA, KS, ME or even KY to flip it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I echo Victoria‚Äôs assessment.  #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ewarren Sanders' closing statement was still only criticism of the status quo and not a single word on his programs, plans, or of inspiration to voters. He came off as an angry old man shouting into the wind. Disappointing.  #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ewarren Glad Sanders was asked ab. socialism, b/c it's going to come up again, esp. since a recent poll said that a majority of Americans don't like the idea.  Sanders was given a chance to defend his position &amp; spoke ab. socialism for wealthy &amp; corporations.  #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She's not alone. In our household, we're tired of being yelled at by Sanders, as if we can't hear or understand what he's trying to say.  Insightful daughter. #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Leslie4848 @ewarren @amyklobuchar Yes, that was classy. However, Klobuchar should have been able to fully stand up for herself, but she was obviously embarrassed and irritated by the question, simultaneously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warren @ewarren has been showing how tough she can be in this debate.  That's a big plus. Imagining how she would respond to a direct verbal encounter with Trump.  #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JRubinBlogger So some males can rail away and yell and scream, but a woman sounds emphatic and you're upset, @JRubinBlogger?  Please reflect on this gender-specific criticism.  Watched it happen in 2016. NOT tolerating it again.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mehdirhasan The entire state of Illinois is not surprised.  We are grateful that Blago is barred for life from ever running for political office in the state.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All #Republican Senators' fault.  Every single thing Trump does, from his "acquittal" to the election. They know who he is and what he's capable of. And they shirked their Constitutional responsibilities to protect our republic. They are and always will be cowards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"In other words, this poll and its subsequent publication make up a staggering act of deliberate journalistic malpractice..."  Could not agree more. @NBCPolitics &amp; @WSJ should be ashamed. Looks like another instance of gender discrimination to me. Offensive is an understatement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On our local news:  #Blagojevich claims he was "persecuted".  The evidence against him was overwhelming.  He's learned nothing. Glad he's barred from running for political office in Illinois--for life--or he could become a repeat offender. IL does not deserve more #corruption.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some of @ewarren's greatest hits--pun intended.  People don't want to be held accountable for fleecing Americans are afraid of her. They should be.  She's an advocate for ordinary people against the overreach of the powerful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First, "Buy a Pardon." Now, "Sell a Pardon".  Since Republicans failed to hold Trump to account, there's nothing Trump won't do. And, as a result, remember that the GOP is partially responsible for whatever Trump does going forward. #VoteBlue2020  https://t.co/4kzeFcfaY8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good grief. Here we go again.  If you haven't abandoned @Facebook, I don't understand why. You're leaving yourself open to massive propaganda, not to mention the loss of your personal data and privacy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Illinois citizen here. The evidence was overwhelming. #Blagojevich was even caught on tape.  He was: #impeached &amp; removed by a bipartisan legislature #convicted of crimes by a jury #barred for life for running for any political office in IL  Read.   https://t.co/60HGcTyFx8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nycsouthpaw @joshtpm It's the lack of complete transparency for me.  We already have a stonewalling President who found physicians who would provide not-entirely-above-board health reports.  If he'll stonewall to get into office, will he stonewall other info while in office? That's my concern.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump found a willing physician to vouch for his "health" too.   A man who will hide his health from voters will hide other information from citizens should he be elected.  Lacking transparency should be a deal-breaker for voters, especially after Trump's stonewalling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Illinois' #DemocraticPrimary is not until March 17. Neither I nor my partner have decided who to vote for. But we are definitely being turned off by a couple of them.  We'll be watching tonight as @MikeBloomberg is tested. He has &gt;a lot&lt; to explain to voters ab. his candidacy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Definitely a reason to consider whether Sanders can win in the general election.  Sanders can't deflect the unpopular label. He's admitted he's a socialist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bad news: Socialism isn't as popular as Sanders' supporters think.  "Asked about their impression of socialism, only about a quarter of Americans (28%) said they have a favorable view, while almost 6-in-10 (58%) said they had an unfavorable impression."  https://t.co/95mCemoviS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So there was indeed a basis for claiming @ewarren's erasure. Seems somewhat like journalistic malpractice, @mmurraypolitics and @NBCPolitics and @WSJ.  Stop choosing who to promote and go on the data, please.   Voters expect honest information.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welcome to ‚ÄúBuy a Pardon‚Äù. With Trump everything is transactional.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why some of us worry about Sanders‚Äô health. And his inability to be honest about it by providing his medical records.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It‚Äôs not justice when a President can pardon crony criminals and investigate those who would hold him to account. That‚Äôs the opposite of the rule of law: Grossly unfair and unjust.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Read Gitzgerald‚Äôs statement. It‚Äôs why we in Illinois are disgusted by the commutation of #Blagojevich‚Äôs sentence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finding this stat quite telling ab. Sanders supporters. Obviously some are not actually Democrats, just like their candidate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Asking for Bernie's medical records is not a "smear campaign". He said he'd provide them. Now he won't.  It's rational, logical, and responsible to ask why. Americans have a right to know whether candidates for the Presidency are healthy and fit enough to serve a full term.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly.  Don't exchange one cult for another.  Americans deserve far better, especially after Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Delavegalaw Only &gt;one&lt; candidate has had a heart attack in the past year.   Voters deserve more than a letter from his willing physician. Someone who's had a heart attack is at high risk of having another one in the next 3-5 years. Sanders needs to prove he's healthy enough to serve.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthewamiller @aravosis Another publicity stunt by Trump-Barr?  Would not put it past them. Seems unlikely that Barr will resign in protest.   But he could resign due to public protest about the #corruption of the rule of law and interference in cases of interest to Trump. Few would mourn his departure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Huge issue. In Illinois we have strict contracting laws b/c construction has been subject to the kinds of #corruption that Trump is used to.  No doubt Trump wants to speed up wall construction prior to the election--and buy himself some friends w/taxpayer money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He apparently feels no responsibility to the voters or to the country he claims he wants to serve.  His decision not to release his records will force me to vote for another candidate. Lacking transparency is a major fault in a President.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never has an adage proven more true: Birds of a feather flock together.  The criminals Trump pardoned or whose sentences he commuted have the same values (or lack of them) as the man who set them free. They are all #corrupt.  Remember that when you vote.  #VoteBlue2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hoping they ask Bloomberg about this during the debates. #divestment   https://t.co/L3uPn9kaDf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well. #Blagojevich was #impeached and removed from office by a bipartisan legislature here in Illinois. His corruption was condemned by both parties.  So, it doesn't prove that "both parties are corrupt".   It shows is that both Trump &amp; Blago are corrupt and #ImpeachedForever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a huge issue.  Bloomberg needs to explain how he will relate to his empire, particularly the Bloomberg news organization during the primaries. If he should win the nomination, how will he divest?  Journalists must ask him. #BloombergEmpire<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Outside groups"?  This government used to belong to the people. And the people will have their say.  Over 75,000 people have already signed a petition calling for Barr to resign. By serving only one client, he is making a mockery of justice itself.  #BarrResign<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm an Illinois citizen. How well I understand the crimes of our former Governor, Rod #Blagojevich. He did not deserve to #commutation. Watch this to understand why.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reich is correct. I'm a retiree who's watched this pattern repeat my entire life.  Watch the video. Understand that the GOP always blames the opposition for problems it creates. Don't let it keep happening.  #VoteBlue2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Corrupt politician commutes sentence of corrupt politician while claiming he's fighting corruption by politicians.  Disgusting.  [Trump understands #Blagojevich's corruption and thus sees himself in Blago's crimes.] #Pardon  https://t.co/ZGu8cgIjLL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Blagojevich is one reason Illinois' pension shortfalls are so extreme.  In case it's not clear, Blago was bad for Illinois.   He should not be given an early release from prison; he should not have his sentence commuted. No #Pardon or #commutation.  https://t.co/TXz4XJ20IX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Illinois is sick of political corruption, and #Blagojevich played a huge part in it.  He needs to serve his sentence for his crimes. #Pardon   https://t.co/E9Ik0ianqz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Blagojevich is hardly remorseful.  He thinks he's done nothing wrong, which is why he should serve his sentence and reflect on his crimes.  Yet another reason Trump identifies w/Blago...they cannot see their own wrongdoing. #Pardon    https://t.co/pQGiSEaBqF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The reason #Blagojevich was sentenced for such a long time? He eroded pubic trust in institutions, just as Trump has been doing for his entire term. Trump sees himself in Blago, as I've said all along. #Pardon  https://t.co/sy7ezA0EAH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have no doubt this will happen. #Pardon   https://t.co/OxcUsFohbg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unleashing his criminal hoard to commit further crimes upon society...and possibly join his international criminal cabal.  Unconscionable.  Congress must find a way to limit the President's power of the pardon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BTW: When he was convicted and sentenced, #Blagojevich was barred from EVER running for political office again. Prosecutors and judges viewed his crimes that heinously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As an Illinois citizen, I object &gt;strenuously&lt; to #Blagojevich's commutation. He should serve his entire term for what he did, particularly in selling a Senate seat but for his other crimes as well.  Why is Trump so in love with criminals? Because he sees himself in them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"In a modern spin on propaganda, it focuses on sowing doubt about Western governments &amp; institutions".

<|startoftext|>"The Brookings Institution calculated that the counties carried by Hillary Clinton in 2016 account for nearly two-thirds of U.S. economic output."

<|startoftext|>@LillcyTweets @mrsolsonsays Agree. It's going to get worse for anyone who looks like a contender. I'm seeing multiple take-downs of Bloomberg this morning as well.  I have yet to select a candidate since our primary is weeks away. I read widely, and have lots of questions and concerns...about them all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LillcyTweets @mrsolsonsays I don't care who you support. Enjoy. But no candidate is above criticism. Questioning is how we vet them, to determine whether they can endure the enormous job of the Presidency.  So let's not pretend that any candidate is perfect. We need to know if they can do the job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't care who you support in the #DemocraticPrimary.  No candidate is perfect, and your candidate is definitely not above criticism.  Stop reacting as if the candidate you support cannot be asked legitimate questions by journalists. Just stop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LillcyTweets @mrsolsonsays So you think I just want to tear down your candidate?  No. I want a candidate to serve out the term.   And I want someone who is **transparent** with the American people. Neither of those criteria are too much to ask of a candidate.  That's all I'm saying. If Bernie can, great.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every one of them were better than the current one (and I disagreed with some policies advanced and actions taken by each of them).  Happy #PresidentsDay2020.  https://t.co/Zo5WE9DuLS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LillcyTweets @mrsolsonsays This is my point. Letters from doctors are not enough. Even Trump found a physician willing to declare he was healthy.   Where are the medical reports, which Sanders refuses to release? After one heart attack, the risk of having a second in the next 3-5 years rises dramatically.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ESPNChiCubs Way to abandon the fans.  Upset w/@Cubs, @Comcast, as well as @WatchMarquee.  This won't make us go to Wrigley more, for ex. (We live hundreds of miles away and I'm a retiree w/o means.) Maybe have to skip this season following the team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LillcyTweets Complete medical records or a summary?  That's why I'm irritated w/him. He claims he's released them, but not really. Voters need to know if he can withstand the rigors of a full term.  If he cannot be completely transparent before he gets into office, what else will he hide?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's telling the American people to go "pound sand".  We deserve answers to our legitimate questions about his candidacy. Is he healthy enough to endure even one term as President? He won't release his records.  What does that say ab. a Sanders Presidency?  https://t.co/cUNCtKtd6K<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thread.  Defeating Trump is one thing.   Governing afterwards will become extraordinarily important. There will be a lot to repair.  Thread.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Democrats must vet candidates who want the ultimate power. @MikeBloomberg's come in late and is trying to buy his way into candidacy.  We should expect him to prove himself to voters.

<|startoftext|>@JamesSurowiecki @jaycaspiankang @MattZeitlin Small states may not, in fact, be representative. Have to look at them statistically. But two small states--Iowa and NH--have had terrible track records in prognosticating how the nation would vote, eliminating candidates early. Argues against a different small state going first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesSurowiecki Take a look at Illinois:  White: 71.67% Black or African American: 14.23% Other race: 5.95% Asian: 5.39% Two or more races: 2.48% Native American: 0.25% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander: 0.04%  With a larger population, it'd be better take on how the nation would vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DemFromCT @JamesSurowiecki Yes. Illinois is an excellent match for a "first in the nation" primary.  And our governor is promoting the idea.  https://t.co/xHq4mwycAF<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Barr's an authoritarian whose views on the power sharing among the three branches of government are inconsistent with the Constitution.  Read this profile. #BarrMustGo   https://t.co/hv2elx9Tja<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>&gt;IF&lt; we ever have a post-Trump government, one thing is abundantly clear:  The power of the Executive branch needs to be limited and the powers of Congress must be strengthened.  And Congress must make that happen. Work to turn the Senate blue...and to maintain a blue House.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Providing more reasons to be skeptical of a Sanders' candidacy.  The candidate I vote for must -be healthy enough to endure the rigors of a full term -choose a VP who's qualified to become President  Neither of these suggested VP choices meets the second criterion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Worse:   #Republicans blame the old, the sick, the poor, and the disabled for the problem, proposing to take away benefits we've paid for all of our working lives to make up the difference, after giving themselves huge tax cuts.  That's your Republican party.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>OMG, this. Thanks, @mluckovichajc.  cc: @SenatorCollins<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All Democratic candidates need to *fully* disclose medical issues.   Democrats need to know whether the candidate they vote for has the stamina and general health to withstand the rigors of the office of the Presidency. #DemocraticPrimary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A worthy thread on Trump's mental status.  He's not merely "a little off". He's shown signs of neurological deficits in recent weeks, slurring words, walking off-balance. He's paranoid and delusional. Should we call it something ... worse than that?   https://t.co/RjDq0QNyzN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The paranoid always feel like this. Eventually they come to distrust loyalists as well. Untrustworthy people project that fault onto others until there's no one they feel they can trust.  Before his resignation Nixon spoke with the portraits on the WH walls b/c he trusted so few.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Timothy Snyder was Rachel Maddow's guest. (Snyder is History Professor, Yale Univ., and author of On Tyranny.)  Watch to learn about #Tyranny + opposition to it.  He also, importantly, speaks about #Solidarity in #Resistance. Worth watching.   https://t.co/SNuHnDjdwz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It‚Äôs about time Congress stands up for its appropriations authority.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The nation is not ready for voting by app.  Let‚Äôs not entrust our sacred vote to potential hacking or vote changing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this is why it's shocking that Trump doesn't want staff to listen to his calls: Other countries could easily manipulate him or worse. The US would have no records. #NationalSecurity   https://t.co/JQdto1zU7k<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We should be asking why Trump can't tell people what he is doing in our government. Why doesn't he want his aides to know? Why does he make translators destroy their notes, in violation of the records act? What is he hiding?  #GovernmentTransparency is important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once again, for those of you who don't realize it:  A man is appropriating a woman's ideas and seeming to be just fine with that b/c her ideas were up for grabs (!).  Sick of this...infinitely. Just stop it. And stop supporting men who do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The public DOES need "to see full health records of a 78-year-old man who recently suffered a heart attack and now hopes to be commander in chief..."  The public deserves to see those records if he wants the job. Also his TAXES. No stonewalling.  https://t.co/cUNCtKtd6K<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FYI: All of the above is Orwellian. It's what dictators do.  None of it belongs in our democratic republic.   Truth matters. Ethics matter. Right matters.  #dictatorship #autocracy  #Cult45<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The real story is this:  Trump rehires loyalists, places loyalists, and only trusts loyalists--those who won't speak truth to power or speak truth after they leave. Why? Trump fears the truth. He'd rather be told lies (and tell lies himself) to project his fantasies of 'reality'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree. Here are the competitive Senate races. Twice as many GOP Senators must run this cycle. A few races that could turn:  Collins (Maine) Gardner (Colorado) McSally (Arizona) Tillis (North Carolina)  Support one of their challengers.  https://t.co/zvpDMNnVmB<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mashagessen Things may seem normal. You go to work, you take care of...whatever you care about.  Yet Trump is blasting the foundations of our country. The separation of powers. The rule of law. Ethics.  Pay close attention. Dictatorship is upon us.  Fight for the country you love. #autocracy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Reviving this revised essay #autocracy: Rules for Survival by @mashagessen, since it's more than applicable as we watch Trump shred the #RuleOfLaw.

<|startoftext|>These NH demographics are also why I do not trust NH to prognosticate the #DemocraticPrimary.   It's too early to make predictions when a small state like NH (pop. 1.35M) is voting.   41 states (82%) have larger populations than NH, and many have more representative voters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THIS is why NH should not be a leading state. It's unrepresentative of Democratic demographics.  #DemocraticPrimary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love the @Cubs but they will lose our household as fans without a deal between @WatchMarquee and @comcast/@Xfinity.

<|startoftext|>What did Republicans think Trump would do after they refused to hold him accountable? They can't hold him back now. Cowards.  The GOP (except Romney) has been willfully blind. They're responsible for ALL the horrors we're seeing. #TrumpCorruption    https://t.co/Y7AUxZXxB3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly what Michael Cohen said in his testimony to the House.   Trump doesn't have to be direct. His underlings know what he means and act on it. Just like a mob boss. And then Trump has plausible deniability.  #CORRUPTION<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Democrats don't have a frontrunner YET.  Delegates awarded in other states, for ex: TX = 228 NY = 274 CA  = 415  It's still early. #DemocraticPrimary   Here's a delegate tracker:  https://t.co/2gFVIgKpVY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reality check for those calling for candidates to drop out. We've got a long way to go.  (WHY are Iowa an NH first? They are less representative of the demographics of the Democratic party than most states. That must change.) #DemocraticPrimary   https://t.co/Z7zTTQZN3d<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Having a hard time supporting someone who -is a socialist, not a Democrat -has a short record of achievement in 40 yrs -is 78 years old, had a heart attack but won't release his medical records -historically won't support other Democrats for our Democratic nominee #NotMyCandidate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If this situation continues, a President will be able to dictate to the DOJ who gets indicted, who gets prosecuted, &amp; who goes to jail.

<|startoftext|>.@CNN reporting that a 3rd prosecutor withdrew.  Trump interfering in justice. He'll deny it, but it's obvious from his Twitter feed what he wanted. Remember what Michael Cohen said? He doesn't have to give a direct order. His reports know what he wants.  Happy now, GOP?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reasons why, even though journalists are on the edge of their seats, voters nationally are not overly concerned ab. today's contest.  -&gt;We know that Iowa + NH shouldn't lead the nation. -&gt;Dems everywhere want to be heard. -&gt;We know Super Tuesday is coming. #DemocraticPrimary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Republicans gave themselves tax cuts. Now they don't have enough money to run the government.  So they're going to take more money out of the pockets of those who can least afford it--seniors, the poor, working families. That's the #TrumpBudget.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now Republicans are afraid of ANY criticism on how Trump wants to spend taxpayer money. Budgets = values.  Sen. Budget Chairman Enzi said he won't hold a hearing on Trump‚Äôs $4.8T budget, warning that it will turn into a ‚Äúdiatribe against the president.‚Äù  https://t.co/AyFs9f5Ull<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't know why this isn't getting more press.  Trump is preventing the American people from hearing from our top intelligence officers, and now preventing our representatives from hearing from them as well. What does he want hidden from us?  Yet another step toward #Dictatorship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why aren't pundits calling him deranged, because clearly he's losing his mind just to try to divide the Democratic party. His desperation has overtaken any sanity he had.  We do not need an unhinged man with the world's largest economy and the US military under his thumb.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump's proposed cuts to #SocialSecurity, #Medicare  &amp; #Medicaid will upset voters for sure.  As a retiree, I will ask my reps not to support them. If they do, I will vote for their opponents in November.  Also, @AARPadvocates needs to speak out loudly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So rare to see a poll of small business owners' voting preferences.  The poll, released Monday, was conducted Jan. 15 to 24, before the Iowa caucuses. #SmallBusiness  #DemocraticPrimary    https://t.co/0M1ymxvkne<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My concern as well. "What if Democrats nominate Sanders and he has another heart attack?"  He needs to release his medical records. The American people need to understand whether his health is adequate to meet the challenges of the Presidency.  https://t.co/jDQMVb8GzP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a show-stopper for me. Americans have a right to know whether their candidate is physically well enough for the most stressful job in the nation. Bernie should release these records. #Health Matters.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Klobuchar mentioning Trump's penchant for blaming US friends for issues is a stellar criticism.

<|startoftext|>Martin Niem√∂ller's 1946 poem: "First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out‚ÄîBecause I was not a Socialist..."  Only today, Trump triggered the same issue: "First they came for a man who complied with a lawful subpoena and spoke the truth to power..." #Vindman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The tyrant begins his #vendetta.  The US has become a dictatorship.  It's only going to get worse.  Republican Senators own all the horrors b/c they refused to do their duty to the separation of powers and the republic to which they once pledged allegiance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could not agree more with @GovPritzker.  People outside our state think Illinois is urban, b/c of Chicago. As a former Chicagoan and long-time down-stater, I can attest that we have everything you can imagine here. Our state is far more representative of the nation than Iowa.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump's Vengeance Initiative has begun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Republican Senators are responsible for any and all of Trump's abuses of power.  They had a chance to put an end to his sociopathic impulses and abuse. In future, they must own their responsibility for what happens.  #UncheckedPower: Absolute power corrupts absolutely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And Republicans were "aghast" when Schiff mentioned this during the #ImpeachmentHearing.   Now Trump's #vengeance efforts have begun...and this warning isn't absurd after all, is it?  https://t.co/DDs17vvqKD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And a Jesuit priest righteously criticizes the President's National Prayer breakfast speech b/c it's obvious that Trump is ignorant of Christian thought, teaching, or the purpose of prayer itself. Thank you, @JamesMartinSJ.   https://t.co/qSLIhg9hSG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, those clapping, laughing, and applauding Trump's self-pitying vengeance speech disturbed me as much as the speaker's comments.  This is how fascism begins--when cowards cannot find the courage to contain a madman but instead do everything to encourage him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could not agree more w/this analysis.  "Trump Is Defiling His Office" and turned the #SOTU into a spectacle, a circus for his supporters only, not, as intended by the framers, to inform the nation.  https://t.co/uTjNDI6tcI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump's unfamiliar w/this verse, too, b/c he's going to speak today &amp; vow vengeance on his "enemies".  Romans 12:19 Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave room for the wrath of God; for it is written, ‚ÄúVengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.‚Äù (Also Hebrews 10:29-31)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump went on to attack his "enemies" &amp; call all Democrats corrupt.  To have a President who exemplifies none of the virtues outlined in the text evangelicals claim to follow, and to have him speak at prayer breakfast, is simply bizarre.  #TrumpsNotAChristian<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A core Christian belief is forgiveness. Trump doesn't know the meaning of the word.  And today at the National Prayer Breakfast, this happened, to illustrate that. #TrumpsNotAChristian  https://t.co/Vr9xpJN1sd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's fascinating ab. Trump's embrace of evangelicals is, of course, his utter godlessness.  If he were a true Christian, he would at the very least have familiarity with the verse:  "Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you." Matt. 5:43-48  #TrumpsNotAChristian<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"One of the signals that came out of this acquittal today is basically a green light to our adversaries. You can attack our institutions, our elections, our democracy and get away with it. In fact, the President may even invite it in." --Jeremy Bash #11thHour  #AcquittalImpacts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While this is disheartening, it's also telling.  1) He's bullied his loved ones into nominally agreeing with him. 2) He's eternally targeted the opposition party.  Trump will forever be the President only for those who support him. That's how he thinks, acts, and loves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyceWhiteVance Yes. We're ignoring them b/c we question the validity of the tally and lack of full certification. Iowa made itself irrelevant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If there wasn't a real trial w/documents and witnesses, he wasn't acquitted. 51 Senators voted not to remove. Not the same thing.

The actions he takes and orders he gives reveal the man's true allegiances. Thus also watch his henchmen--the men of power who carry out his directives.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Imagine all the actions a President could take, should there be no check on his power.  Imagine what a President of the opposition party could enact or take advantage of.  Dershowitz's position is simply untenable in a democratic republic.  #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Potential scenario: To further his re-election "in the national interest", a President, could jail his opponents.  Since the President cannot be indicted, according to an OLC memo, and, under the "Dersh defense", he could not be impeached, there's no remedy. #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Using Trump's "Dersh defense", a President could -buy votes -buy off state election officials -bargain w/foreign countries to hack our elections -threaten &amp; intimidate voters  IOW, he could corrupt our entire electoral system and no one could stop it. #ImpeachmentTrial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed it does.  #ImpeachmentTrial #WeNeedWitnesses<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's increasingly clear that Senators may never get their questions answered as fully as they might like, or at all, unless they allow #Witnesses.  #ImpeachmentTrial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So while a President is running for re-election, he can violate all election laws?  This is absurd on its face. If not, we have a dictator or king, not a President. And the rule of law is over. #ImpeachmentTrial<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Irritating to hear Robert Ray claim that Trump did not break the law in withholding aid to #Ukraine this morning on @CNN (turned it off).  Trump did, in fact, break the law, according to a GAO independent investigation. #ImpeachmentTrials   https://t.co/9bv54Jgdq2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Republicans just want to get it over with, with a target deadline of the Super Bowl, an artificial deadline.  Bottom line: Republican Senators don't want a fair trial. They don't want to hear the truth. They're actually opposed to justice. Astonishing. #ImpeachmentTrial<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Remember: Republicans gave the wealthy tax cuts.

They planned to take away the benefits you've paid into all your life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reminds me of Rod Blagojevich, who claims he did nothing wrong after he tried to sell a Senate seat to the highest bidder. (Blago's still in jail for this crime.)  It is a crime to ask a foreign country to interfere in US elections. Trump should know that.  #ImpeachmentTrial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And let's let Trump contradict him under oath.  #ImpeachmentTrial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's Trump's personal Festivus--his chance to air all his grievances--and use surrogates to do so.  Virtually none of these grievances are relevant to the Articles of Impeachment. But what a whiner's festival it is! #ImpeachmentTrial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bolton was Trump's National Security Advisor. He spoke directly with the President. How can the manuscript, written by Bolton and submitted to the WH by his publisher, be "unsourced"?  Sekulow's asking people to believe it's a rumor? Unreal. Absurd. #ImpeachmentTrial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's hear the evidence from Trump's legal team in today's #ImpeachmentTrial that the President  -did not try to get #Ukraine to investigate a political rival -did not obstruct Congress' investigation If they have it, let's hear it.

<|startoftext|>The Trump administration's cruel policy of family separation will resonate for years for these children and their parents.

<|startoftext|>Who didn't know that Trump would try to deflect to Biden, to coverup his own guilt and try to smear his political opponent? It's what he tried to do w/#Ukraine.  Our President cannot take responsibility for his errors. It's one reason he must be removed. #ImpeachmentTrial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Says more about Sec. Pompeo than it does about @michelekelemen. @NPR's reputation has always been stellar.  This administration cannot take criticism and is vengeful and vindictive.  Pompeo has shown himself to be no statesman.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait. When I was raising kids, it was always a tell when a child, accused of misbehaving, kept saying "But...other kids did it."  That's what we're hearing from Trump's legal team. They claim, without evidence, that someone else did what Trump did and somehow that clears him? No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump defenders want you to forget:  The President did not use official channels to "fight corruption". Instead, he used a set of shadowy figures who did not work for the US government, even though Trump has the entire executive branch at his disposal. #ImpeachmentTrial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Adjectives used to describe Giuliani explain nothing ab. why he was engaged in a "domestic political errand" for Trump, who withheld $391M appropriated by Congress and conditioned its release on the announcement of an investigation of Trump's political rival. #ImpeachmentTrial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump legal defense in a nutshell: He should not be investigated or tried, according to...the defendant.  Logic has been murdered.  #TrumpImpeachmentTrial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even tho Bernie supporters claim they're not bullies, any Democrat who wants to test that truth only has to criticize Sanders on Twitter. They'll be inundated by hundreds if not thousands of supporters attacking the poster and defending their candidate.  It's a bullying mob.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Frum's article is worth reading.  Bernie hasn't been thoroughly vetted. And Trump will use every negative statement made, by his detractors as well as Sanders' own words, to crush him.  He may be leading some polls now, but I, too, worry that he can't win a general.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump is having his "due process" now, in the Senate.  Will Trump's legal team try to defend what Trump did?  So far there's been no defense of his conduct, only distractions, diversions, and complaints. Not good enough. #impeachment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time for Bolton to testify.  #AmericansWantWitnesses<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here's the slide on "burden sharing", something that Trump defenders bring up as one of Trump's concerns about #Ukraine.   https://t.co/MODbksnFFF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sadly, expecting logic or coherence from Trump sycophants leads to disappointment. All they have are logical fallacies, like strawman arguments and ad hominem attacks, every single time.  And ordinary citizens, like me, regularly weep for the country. #AmericansWantWitnesses<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Senate's clear duty is to seek the truth (the whole truth and nothing but the truth) in the #ImpeachmentTrial.  If Senators believe they have not yet heard enough first-hand witnesses, call them. A fair trial should be the goal. #AmericansWantWitnesses  https://t.co/oAJEbMDtBN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In what trial do we hear the arguments first and the witnesses last (if at all)? Why isn't that a perversion of justice?  This Senate process is broken. Call witnesses. Use subpoenas if necessary. Don't short-circuit a fair trial.  #AmericansWantWitnesses  #ImpeachmentTrial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Senators want more first-hand witnesses, other than Sondland, they should vote to call them.  GOP Senators are the only ones stopping the Senate from asking for witness testimony, depositions, or documents before they decide on the case. #ImpeachmentTrial  #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Recall: Gordon Sondland, Ambassador to the EU, who testified before the House, spoke directly with Trump ab. withholding the #Ukraine aid. There's video of his testimony.  Trump's legal team lied to mislead the Senate. #ImpeachmentTrial  #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree.  Even if your Senator is a Democrat, call and let him/her know that you support a fair trial in the Senate, with witnesses and documents. They need to know they have their constituents' support.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wondering why Trump tweeted something nasty about Krugman? Missed his recent column, arguing that Trump is abusing his power to use national security as a pretext for threatening to impose #tariffs on EU. He has a point.   https://t.co/zU4GLi48Fl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good question.  The Obstruction of Congress article of impeachment goes directly to this question. #ImpeachmentTrial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Here's the reality. This President goes after you if you oppose him." - former Sen.

No question.  https://t.co/VwkoNIzwIV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Ukraine was so corrupt, why didn't Trump work with Congress on a plan to withhold the aid?  Trump's defense has no answer for why they did not work through official channels and notify Congress as required by law. #Ukraine  #ImpeachmentTrial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The House managers did the fact-check yesterday, with a slide that showed how much more the EU spends, as one example.  But some people are not burdened by a desire to know the facts. #ImpeachmentTrial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly.  Do not mistake outrage and vehemence for evidence.  They are outraged that anyone would have the insolence to question them. And that's a hallmark of the assumption of imperial power.  #ImpeachmentTrial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Being offended b/c Schiff noted a threat reported by @CBSNews cannot undo the mountain of evidence proving Trump did what the Articles of Impeachment contend, but Republicans must have been scouting the speech for a pretext. #ImpeachmentTrial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly right.  The separation of powers and Congressional oversight are at risk from acquitting Trump. Can't they see that they'll be ceding power to the Executive if they don't remove a man who's longed to become a dictator since he was inaugurated? #RemoveTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You'd hope that Republicans would be more concerned ab. the damage done to the Republic when free and fair elections are at risk from Trump, a wannabe dictator who believes he's above the law. #ImpeachmentTrial #RemoveTrump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Also: Trying to extort a foreign power to engage in US election interference -- illegal.  Trump engaged in multiple illegal acts in the #Ukraine scandal.

<|startoftext|>This is the third time in my adult life that a President has been subject to this solemn process.

<|startoftext|>Unless it's your job, you may not be able to watch all of the #ImpeachmentHearings in the Senate. But as a retiree, I've had the time to watch. The House Managers have been making a compelling case.  If it's too difficult for Senators to listen, they should not seek re-election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. Fox News proved its partisanship and perspective by not trusting its viewers to make their own assessments.  That's not #journalism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course some might call this dereliction of duty.  The Senate is Constitutionally required to try Articles of #Impeachment. When they don't even pay attention, voters should.  They're obviously uninterested in doing their jobs. Vote them out in November. #ImpeachmentTrial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Historians will uncover whether those politicians were as compromised by foreign help in their elections as was their leader, either through funding, advertising, social media, electioneering, or...other means, that needed to be hidden from voters. #ForeignInterference #Elections<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AARPadvocates Trump "already proposed cuts for some safety-net programs.

It also called for spending $26B less on #SocialSecurity..."  https://t.co/reafN1soYG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"The poison of excessive factionalism" is a phrase our nation needs to reflect upon.

<|startoftext|>@AARPadvocates Here's Trump pledging to cut entitlements like #SocialSecurity and #Medicare.  This is what Republicans have long wanted to do. First they cut government revenues and then claim it can't afford to pay for the programs we've paid into all our lives.   https://t.co/LQgbDIqr9N<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepJeffries So Republican Senators have not read the briefs, they don't want witnesses, and they don't want documents.  Theirs is the Ostrich caucus.  #ImpeachmentTrial   https://t.co/Bi2rRNqcmU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whoa.  Well, Senators, as @RepJeffries said in his Senate presentation yesterday (quoting famous song lyrics), "And if you don't know, now you know."   #ImpeachmentTrial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The claim that #impeachment "overturns an election" is specious.  Trump was impeached b/c he betrayed the public trust by using taxpayer funds as leverage to extort a foreign nation to investigate his political rival.  It's not ab. 2016. It's ab. what Trump did while in office.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember this: Trump wants to cut #SocialSecurity, #Medicare, #Medicaid because "they're easy" to cut.  Retirees who take Social Security receive an average benefit of $1,503 per month, or $18,036 for the full year.  Calling on @AARPadvocates to alert members on Trump's remarks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Louder, for those in the back, please.  McConnell's authoritarian approach makes him conduct the body like a feudal lordship, destroying the deliberative &amp; democratic nature of the Senate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And then there's this:  Congress has a right to know whether the Executive is faithfully administering its appropriations. Instead, Trump's government stonewalled Congress.  Outrageous.  https://t.co/mUDanA9TOd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just how much this administration has hidden from the American people is shocking.  Ours is *the people's* government. It does not belong to one party or the other. And the people deserve to see these documents. Government #transparency still matters. #ImpeachmentTrial  https://t.co/zD24iBObKE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This line of defense by Trump manager Philbin is gaslighting.  Trump prevented documents and witnesses requested by the House. He refused to make his case in the House. And he refused to allow others to do so as well. He stonewalled his own defense.  #ImpeachmentTrial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today Senate Republicans + WH legal team have proven, to paraphrase a famous film:   They can't handle the truth.  They've voted repeatedly to prevent the truth ab. the #UkraineScandal from coming to light.  #ImpeachmentTrialRules<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YES. @RepJeffries is enumerating the WH personnel who testified before the Senate during #Watergate. I remember them.  I also remember the courts insisting on the WH providing the Nixon tapes.  The Republicans in this Senate are derelict in their duty. #ImpeachmentTrialRules<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scratching my head...  What ever happened to representative democracy?  Is that dead now? Do Senators recall how they got into the Senate?  Do voters still matter?  #ImpeachmentTrial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Only 19 other individuals besides Trump have been impeached by the House of Representatives. The Senate completed a trial in 15 of those cases, and in every single one of them, it heard testimony from witnesses." #ImpeachmentTrialRules   https://t.co/xQCzmF0ZMa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This.  Americans know better but the President's legal team keeps trying to confuse. #ImpeachmentTrialRules   https://t.co/VK6gtZ8Mpp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mystified by the argument that the Senate is being asked to "do the House's job".  ALL Senate trials in history have had witness testimony. Every single one, whether a Presidential impeachment or other trial.   In what trial does the jury not see evidence?  #ImpeachmentTrialRules<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rep. Lofgren is making a powerful argument for admitting evidence into the #ImpeachmentTrial.  After all, that's the only fair thing to do.  The American people deserve to hear the evidence. And Trump claimed at one time that he wanted a fair trial.  #ImpeachmentTrialRules<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy to see that the GAO Report which found that the President had broken the law by withholding aid to #Ukraine has been included in these presentations.  The Senate must review evidence + take testimony from witnesses. It's the only way to a fair trial. #ImpeachmentTrialRules<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>McConnell's bluff on having the votes erodes the credibility he initially had.  Fair trials matter. Evidence matters. Our calls to our senators matter.  #ImpeachmentTrial  #ImpeachmentTrialRules<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The incoherence of Trump's legal team is so obvious. They also argued:  &gt;Trump wasn't allowed to call witnesses in the House, which was a violation of his right to defend himself. &gt;Trump doesn't want witnesses to be called in the Senate.  #ImpeachmentTrialRules  #Impeachment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are we just going to have to listen to incoherent rage from Trump's defenders throughout this trial? Didn't we have enough of that during the House's hearings? (I know I did.)  #ImpeachmentTrialRules<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. What I tried to tweet but didn‚Äôt express as well.  #ImpeachmentTrialRules<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Attacking the prosecutor doesn‚Äôt exonerate the accused.   Trump‚Äôs people can‚Äôt stay with the rules or charges. They‚Äôre arguing against bringing witnesses and then blaming the man who wants to allow witnesses! #ImpeachmentTrialRules<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump did nothing wrong but he‚Äôs being impeached b/c people don‚Äôt like him? What?  Evaluate the case on its merits‚Äîand don‚Äôt assert that this very solemn proceeding comes from a lack of popularity.   Address what Trump is alleged to have done. #ImpeachmentTrialRules<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Schiff is making a powerful argument for fairness in the #ImpeachmentTrialRules.  For example: You don't call witnesses *after* you argue the case. Most Americans understand that doing that would be illogical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is how reporters for the #ImpeachmentTrial  are being "contained". #PressFreedom   https://t.co/14PdpeNpWe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>51% of the Americans surveyed "said Trump had encouraged election interference. Eighty-eight percent of Democrats and 51% of independents backed that assertion."  https://t.co/tgkS8Z3z89<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The idea that the House "botched" the #impeachment by not calling all the witnesses is undercut by the fact that the President blocked witnesses from testifying and documents from being provided.

<|startoftext|>Been pondering @JuliusGoat's posts from earlier today.  Dissent is an American tradition. Respectful disagreement is healthy. Debate exposes issues and nuances. We cannot solve problems we refuse to face.  As Moxon said:  https://t.co/nrW0n3INhd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also seems to me like an electioneering ploy:  If the GOP can call Hunter Biden, they can publicly smear  his father--a potential rival to Trump--while simultaneously defending and promoting their candidate.  Hardly why #Impeachment exists in the Constitution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With a record like this, it's mystifying how anyone would believe a single word Trump says, or repeat his lies even to quote him.  #TrumpLiesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If there are witnesses who can clear Trump, why aren't Republicans interested in allowing them to testify?  An innocent man would welcome that opportunity. Wouldn't he?  #Impeachment  #ImpeachmentTrial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Given a second term, this administration will no doubt work to eliminate healthcare for Americans, including reducing or eliminating government support for #Medicaid and #Medicare.  We can't allow that to happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Important update to the story about the National Archives' issue.  Thanks, @USNatArchives, for correcting your mistake.  Preservation of the historical record, regardless of concerns we may have ab. uncomfortable aspects of it, remains an important value in a democratic republic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thread.  #Impeachment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now club members pay Trump to get access to details of top secret military operations.  I'm a retiree so I can say it: The country's gone to hell in a handbasket. SMDH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cannot believe any responsible person would make this argument, much less counsel for the President.  The sovereignty of the US should never be at risk. It is the President's duty to protect and defend it; if he were to shirk that duty, it would be impeachable. No doubt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This thread provides a clarification about the alteration of a photo from the National Archives.  It is still exceedingly unclear WHY the Archives would alter an historic photo for any purpose, including marketing. Altering historical records is an attempt to whitewash history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many of the major figures in the #Watergate hearings appear in the video above, people such as WH officials John Dean, John Mitchell, HR Haldeman, John Erlichman and Senators. Ervin, Baker, and Rodino.  Definitely worth reviewing prior to Trump's #ImpeachmentHearings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So he‚Äôs a witness? What exactly is his role? Because people pontificating for #POTUS during #Impeachment isn‚Äôt an traditional role...unless you‚Äôre a GOP Senator.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@morethanmySLE @RedTRaccoon I‚Äôm in awe of you both. Thanks for your tireless advocacy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LesliesBookcase @NBCThisisUs Aww, Leslie. Sweet post and touching photo of you with your son.

<|startoftext|>History: "If the many allegations made to this date are true...what they were seeking to steal ... was something more valuable, the right to vote in free and fair elections." --Sen.

<|startoftext|>Famous SCOTUS case where I live: McCollum v. Board of Education (1948)  SCOTUS ruled (8‚Äì1) that an IL public school board violated the 1A‚Äôs establishment clause when it allowed religious instruction during school hours and on school property.  Trump may have legal trouble w/this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This kind of kowtowing is what happens in dictatorships. We can't let it happen here.  The US is a government of, by, and for the people. Congress should hold these hearings to help the people understand the threats the country faces.   https://t.co/YGwo3V0sGk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hard for me, an ordinary citizen and voter, to understand how Senators can take an oath of impartiality that they openly admitted -- well in advance -- that they plan to violate.   How is that justice? Why not recuse? cc: @senatemajldr @LindseyGrahamSC  #ImpeachmentTrial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And finally, the claim that Trump did not break the law regarding his withholding of aid to #Ukraine is now false.  #GAOReport #ImpoundmentControlAct  https://t.co/IuXC5u2yc4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>State Department also failed to respond to requests for information regarding its role in withholding #Ukraine aid. Why do these agencies think they have no responsibility to be transparent? They supposedly serve &gt;the people&lt;.  Where is Pompeo? #GAOReport  https://t.co/Y1pq1uE9zn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ab. Trump's #TradeDeal w/China: "...text of the accord does not provide enough information to determine how it will work in practice, and it is unclear whether China will interpret it differently than" the US.  https://t.co/ttdHk9qHoM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bottom line:  &gt;Trump broke the law  &gt;by withholding funding, intended for #Ukraine,  &gt;appropriated by Congress.  The GAO report needs to be entered into the record at the #ImpeachmentTrial.  #GAOReport #ImpoundmentControlAct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DoD has not responded to requests for information regarding #Ukraine aid release. At all. (What are they hiding?)   https://t.co/t6LI3p5T7v<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This administration broke the law. The decisions to do so were by Trump and Mulvaney. #ImpoundmentControlAct  https://t.co/uZEvsyP0fd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚ÄúFaithful execution of the law does not permit the President to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law...OMB withheld funds for a policy reason, which is not permitted under the Impoundment Control Act.‚Äù   https://t.co/9bv54Jgdq2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The US "has never elected anyone as president who is as far left as Sanders. The only modern Democratic nominees approaching Sanders‚Äôs ideological views were former vice president Walter Mondale in 1984 and then-Sen. George McGovern in 1972."

<|startoftext|>And here's a clip from this morning's news conference. #Impeachment   https://t.co/upnHxFpfRp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree. I read &amp; viewed some of @atrupar's reporting last night. Read @NPR's coverage this morning and was shocked by the lack of detail on the bizarre topics Trump mentioned (Ex: Trump needs for lots of water for his hair).  Omitting those isn't doing the public a service.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The role of the #Senate in the #SeparationofPowers--whether it is in fact the great deliberative body it purports to be or whether it's simply a rubber stamp for its impeached President, which appears to violate the role set out for it in the #Constitution--will be tested.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pelosi, in this news conference, is providing the very reasons that a real #impeachmentTrial is imperative, by focusing on the #Constitution, Trump's violations of his oath of office, and the Senate's need for witnesses and documents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gotta say it: Elevating minor differences between Sanders &amp; Warren to the level of 'feud' undermines Democrats &amp; dilutes messaging on policies, divides the party, and, particularly, presents a petty front for Democrats overall.  Get over minor slights. Promote your candidate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This part of Trump's rally is sickening. Clinton has been accused, investigated, &amp; exonerated repeatedly. The implication that she should be in jail, coming from Trump, is abhorrent.  "Hillary Clinton is the most exonerated politician ever"  https://t.co/6fCtx0X14e<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very concerning thread.  #ImpeachmentTrial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For some reason, I'm unable to "like" or "favorite" any tweets tonight. Just restarted my devices. Doesn't work on any of them, laptop browser or mobile device.  Has something changed, @TwitterSupport?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Outrageous.  How can it be "under consideration"? #PuertoRico is a US territory that's been, once again, hit by a natural disaster. This administration needs to tell the public its justification for withholding aid.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Congress voted on two articles: Article I: Yea 230 Article II: Yea 229 That's a majority, on both articles, who believed he did something wrong--trying to bribe Ukraine for personal gain + obstructing Congress.  Trump's just not used to being held accountable. So he whines.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our government's gone mad.  If Person A was walking down the street and shot Person B b/c A **believed** B was likely to attack him, sometime, somewhere...A would be arrested for attempted murder regardless. Esper's dismissing Trump's evidence-free claim as if it was no big deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I‚Äòve complained about this for years. #Texas plainly edits their textbooks to push inaccurate perspectives.

<|startoftext|>Thread.  It is becoming clearer by the day that no threats were imminent. Trump overreached the authority of his office.  Congress must act. #WarPowers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The @PressSec needs to do the job she owes to the American people.  "In an open letter, a group of 13 former White House press secretaries, foreign service and military officials call for the return of regular White House and other press briefings."   https://t.co/hhBeaF6nIc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No one understands why taxpayers have to pay Grisham's salary when she refuses to do the job:  &gt;&gt;To inform the public about the activities of this administration.  IMHO, she's grifting the government because she's good at groveling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Adding to this thread: "New Iran revelations suggest Trump‚Äôs deceptions were deeper than we thought"  On Congress asserting its war powers authorities--and whether the Senate will have the courage to do so after the House passed its resolution.  https://t.co/bckLfANsRu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We know that he lies repeatedly. We have to begin from that fact pattern until he presents valid facts to back up his claims.  This thread shows why his claim ab. embassy threats should have been considered, at the very least, an unverified claim.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great story tonight on @CBSEveningNews.  As Steve said, about 25% of those who take a DNA test find something that surprises them.  Our family certainly did--and found a branch of the family we never knew about.  #genealogy #DNA<|endoftext|>

Trump is ignorant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also this:  https://t.co/34hD4zIV5X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Multi-target, multi-country military operation. Hardly "imminent threat". This administration continues to lie to the American people.  Trump keeps behaving as if Congress should not be consulted on military actions. Appalling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sanders is a critic, primarily. He talks big but has produced little. And he's not been a consistent friend to Democrats.   https://t.co/SZnMPMMRe4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Name his achievements (not positions). His legislative record has been less than stellar. In this article scroll down to his legislative accomplishments  to see what I mean. As a voter, I need to see his medical records + taxes. On both, he's been evasive.  https://t.co/0zpNXM2l9B<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep.  https://t.co/lbr5PZKQ4B<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have to ask ourselves, seriously: Which parts of the #Constitution, which he took an oath to uphold, has Trump NOT challenged?  Congressional war powers is merely the latest, and separation of powers is one of his biggest beefs.   Trump wishes to act on impulse with impunity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Imminent has a very specific meaning. Give Pompeo a dictionary.  He should look up #kakistocracy too.  If they don‚Äôt know the meaning of crucial words, they should not be in charge of foreign policy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watched the @ABC 2 hr program about #JeffreyEpstein and his victims. It took a decade (!) before his sexual predation even began to be investigated.  Very emotional, disturbing, and sad.  What does justice mean, when the wealthy can escape it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seeing so much of this online.  Dissent is American--always has been--even during wartime.   After Americans were deceived about the origin and purpose of the Iraq war, it's only logical that Americans are skeptical ab. Trump's Iran claims, especially since he's the King of Lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Horrifying.  #TrumpTaxScam added &gt;$1.8T. Then there's this: "The final set of appropriations bills that Congress approved in December added another $500 billion, mostly through the repeal of three taxes that were meant to pay for the Affordable Care Act, the group said." #debt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's start calling Trump the #PropagandaPresident, because all he does is distort or misrepresent the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Journalists have to stop accepting assertions like Graham's. When a public official says "people have been calling", ask "Who?" Trump loves to use "people are saying" or "lots of people tell me", when there's no factual basis for the claim.  Please follow up. Don't regurgitate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting, or terrifying?  Using the levers of government for #propaganda purposes is a key tactic of dictators the world over.  We should be extremely worried about the misuse of media and disinformation campaigns by this administration, and find ways to counter them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Anybody else tired of this? Republicans keep refusing to rein in their own and thus repeatedly write about their longing for Democrats to save them. Not to save democracy. To save them from themselves.   Mystifying. SMDH.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh brother. Local TV station interviewing "man-on-the-street" types who think what Trump did to Soleimani was great.  For the last time, #journalists, a couple people who are willing to talk on camera are NOT REPRESENTATIVE of the public at large.  Why can't you understand that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This thread. Americans expect their representatives to be able to debate US policy on their behalf. The idea that Trump can do as he wishes with no push back is insulting to our democratic republic and Constitution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump was lying about #Iran during this morning's speech.  That Trump makes things up is no secret. He lies ab. his predecessors to make himself look better.   AND the truth about Iran's frozen assets must become better known. Not a gift. Read:  https://t.co/9mf533JAHI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pathetic. Americans' ignorance of world geographical locations is shameful, a black mark on our educational system.  #geography #USEducation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let Former National Security Advisor Susan Rice explain why Trump's actions caused the current crisis w/#Iran.  It's Trum's crisis. He only has himself to blame.  #TrumpsWar #WagTheDog   https://t.co/P1EDowX6Xc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump regularly creates crises from which he "saves" us, often to divert attention from his last act of mayhem (or from being held accountable).  That's how he wears us out so we want to ignore his near-daily crazy-making acts. He exhausts us.  Don't look away. Defend democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We could have had a President who understood diplomacy, who had visited regions Trump disparages, and who had developed international relationships with world leaders and diplomats.  But no...Many voted for the least knowledgeable man in decades. #IvotedforHillaryClinton<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>.@senatemajldr accuses @SpeakerPelosi of "shameless game-playing"? LOL  Who held up a SCOTUS seat for nearly a year? Just one of many shameless actions by McConnell.   Stating you'll have an #impeachment "trial" with no witnesses is another.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turned of @MSNBC  and @CNN for this reason. Cannot buy Trump's framing of the issues yet pundits have decided to follow his breadcrumbs...all the way to his traps.  Sickening and disheartening. #journalism #journalists<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump can't stop blaming Obama for crises Trump himself created. Trump withdrew from the JCPOA, which was working, + Trump withdrew forces from Syria, destabilizing the region. Trump assassinated a top official of the Iranian gov't.  Trump's crisis: He has himself to blame. #Iran<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Also from this NYT article: "The authors of the latest study used customs data to trace the fallout, examining import values before and after the tariffs. The research showed that the tariffs had little impact on China."  So #TrumpTradeWar is failing to meet its goal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We knew this from the start. Now's it's been validated by a research paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research:  Despite propaganda pushed by Trump enablers, American consumers are paying all tariffs on imported goods, just as they did historically. #TrumpTradeWar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MMcHarry Yes, it's that chaotic. There's very little coordination w/in this cult of personality, in which the impulses of one man, w/advice of people of bad faith, form the basis for "foreign policy". Milley is probably a scapegoat for Trump's likely reversal on military withdrawal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, this was not mere speculation. Trump's properties are on Iran's list for revenge.  Divestiture should be mandatory for Presidents. His unwillingness to divest is in fact a national security risk. #TrumpsWar    https://t.co/LgPrgIpEQy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That pork producers succeeded in getting the government to reduce regulations on food inspections seems beyond irresponsible. A fundamental duty of our government is to preserve public safety. If you get sick eating pork, blame Trump &amp; his administration.  #foodsafety<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"The emails are the portrait of a corrupt policy and an effort to conceal it--a tug of war between two sets of government officials, one side trying to protect American security and follow the law, another working to enforce direct orders of the President of the United States."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I live in an area that's surrounded by #rural populations, small towns, and agribusiness.   Urban journalists need to review these myths before reporting. We're *really* sick of small town diner interviews representing *all* of rural America.   https://t.co/9XETzf3wuv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. Even if world leaders don't fear for their own personal safety, they fear for the safety of those they love and care for.  For now, after Trump's action against Soleimani, the world is much less safe, including the families of world leaders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also for those who weren't alive for all the Republican "voodoo economics" and military aggression.  Didn't work; drove the country into deep debt; never helped ordinary people, as Reich points out:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The country's in the midst of madness and the Trump administration continues to lie to the American people.  Trump officials don't even believe themselves when they speak. Watch what they do not what they say.  Credibility completely corroded and corrupted. #TrumpResignNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of many impacts of Trump's incoherence on the world stage.  There is a remedy to restore some sanity to our government and its foreign policy, if the GOP can only find their missing courage: #ImpeachAndRemove.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many Americans will now have experiences they have never had before. Destabilizing the world order and hated for it, we may be unwelcome everywhere. Our world stature has fallen b/c Trump's brutish incompetence. He has risked the safety of millions, including our own. #TrumpsWar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What he said.  #TrumpsWar #WagTheDog<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We could have had a President who had traveled to 112 countries, who had worked and negotiated with diplomats from those countries, and who understood the diplomatic challenges with Iran.  Instead we got a guy who treats foreign policy like WWE. #TrumpsWar  #WagTheDog<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THIS. üëá  #TrumpsWar  #WagTheDog<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My point precisely.  The Trump administration has no credibility. Trump and his officials have lied so often than we cannot trust what they say today, during a crisis. #TrumpsWar #WagTheDog    https://t.co/lAEWJIj3Qs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump still had a duty to confer with Congress, even if this is true.  If he thinks this is a "one-off", he's sadly mistaken. This isn't like killing a terrorist (bin Laden). Soleimani was an official of a sovereign government.  #TrumpsWar #WagTheDog   https://t.co/nlBZAnU2zo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The majority is old enough to remember -#WMDs  -"We will be greeted as liberators" from Bush/Iraq war days. Some fell for it then but won't be fooled again.   If Pompeo has evidence, produce it for Congress.  If not, there should be hell to pay. #TrumpsWar  #WagTheDog<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So now you have to be a member or guest at Mar-a-Lago in order to be briefed on high-stakes #NationalSecurity  issues?  Talk about serious pay-to-play politics. #unethical<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's what he did w/#Ukraine, so why wouldn't he risk US national security for personal benefit again, particularly as a dare to the Senate to remove him?  This is always Trump's high-stakes play--dare people to stop him from breaking laws and rules so he can do whatever he wants.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's sad that the threat of authoritarian tyranny appeared invisible to so many in 2016.  [Personally I had the "benefit" of having grown up w/a narcissistic parent and saw Trump for what he was early on. What I didn't appreciate was a cowed &amp; cowardly GOP.]<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree w/this comment, altho it is tough to teach historical perspective to teens (w/o some maturity). Still, HS students should be taught civics, 20th century history + current (21st c) events. They will be voters on graduation. How can they assess what's in US interests w/o it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bush-Cheney-Rumsfeld sang this scoundrel's song too. And it embroiled the US in endless wars that only defense contractors wanted. Many died; it cost trillions.  Why are we starting this fight? What is the endgame? Americans have a right to understand what's behind #TrumpsWar.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In all the #Ukraine revelations, what don't we know about Trump's unethical dealings as President?  What has he done and effectively hidden from the American people?

<|startoftext|>In the event that you think "It's too expensive to act on climate" or "People are exaggerating the impact of #ClimateChange", read about the economics of doing nothing:  "...permanent economic damage up to four times the size of the 2008 financial crisis."  https://t.co/0HDlhL2j8t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just a note on Buttigieg. I admire #MayorPete.   I just think he needs more experience on the national level + larger executive arena.

<|startoftext|>@MMcHarry @JoeBiden I was trying to keep an open mind about the primary, even though I had a few favorites. Yet each candidate keeps doing things and saying things that turn me off. Biden's was a last straw (after he claimed he'd ignore a subpoena earlier, among other gaffes). This one was too much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeBloomberg The White House is NOT a news room.  Open office space when national security/clearances are necessary and confidential conversations must take place? Misguided on that one point alone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden What @JoyAnnReid said.  Truly irritated at Biden's play for the unicorns he thinks still exist in the Republican party. GOP is Trump now, not what it was 30+ years ago.

<|startoftext|>Do not take Democrats for granted, @JoeBiden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The idea that Biden was ‚Äúthrowing shade‚Äù on Republicans is absurd. He is courting them. And as a Dem, I find it repulsive that he‚Äôs pretending his base won‚Äôt react to his abandonment. Disgusting. You‚Äôve lost me entirely, @JoeBiden. #NoJoe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Republican brand is broken. Today‚Äôs GOP isn‚Äôt the one you served with,  @JoeBiden. Republicans are now associated with Trump, a stain that doesn‚Äôt wash off.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A great failure of this era has been the willingness of the US press to "misread" what is happening politically.

<|startoftext|>I keep coming back to this, because it's so appalling.  Barr made an allegation of spying.  The Inspector General's report proved Barr's assertion was not true.  At all. Completely false.  Barr's conduct is extremely chilling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also Trump "admitted that the foundation had given his presidential campaign control over about $2.8 million that the foundation had raised at a veterans fund-raiser in Iowa in January 2016. Mr. Trump acknowledged the fund-raiser was in fact a campaign event." #TrumpFraud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why we cannot wait for the 2020 election.   -Trump's been trying to get help cheating to win and that effort is ongoing. He sent Guiliani to Europe to advance that effort just this week.  -Trump's #impeachment and removal is urgent because he's a threat to democracy itself.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Barr's overreach disturbs me as much as Trump's.  The US is well on the way toward #dictatorship with them in power. And I say this with true apprehension.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Aawojo Shocking, considering all the evidence.  Censure would in no way stop the impeachable behavior; in fact it would encourage more of it.  The only thing that will stop Trump is punishment. And that means impeachment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What Trump and his sycophants are doing today indicates their desperation following very real allegations that he violated his oath of office. He has no defense. He cannot refute the facts. So he's using lies and propaganda, as well as a visit by Russia (!), to deflect. Pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't help but think that Trump's complaints about the IG report + Barr's interview is preparing the public for Wray's firing.  In Trump's administration now, any hint of dissent is interpreted as "disloyalty to the President". That's the bottom line to this authoritarian regime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Contrary to what the GOP asserts:  1 #Impeachment does NOT nullify an election  2 Impeachment is the REMEDY the Constitution provides to remove a President from office for "bribery, high crimes and misdemeanors"  In my lifetime 3 (!) Presidents have faced Impeachment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many refused to read: -the Mueller report -the July 25 call transcript -multiple witnesses' testimonies -Intelligence Committee report -Judiciary Committee report  Do we really think that those who have already made up their minds will read the #ArticlesOfImpeachment?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would prefer to see the Inspector General's report described as fairly and objectively as possible.  Thus: Read this summary thread.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When the President advances lies on a daily basis, this is what the nation sees--Trump's typical propaganda.  Some may normalize it. I have never gotten used to it. Still shocking. Still appalling. And I still find Trump's daily lying to the public to be in violation of his oath.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A somber day. Impeaching a President is a cause for reflection in sadness. That any President committed acts that warrant an investigation and an indictment by Congress will always be a stain on the country.  Trump cannot avoid those charges by his usual hubris. #Impeachment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why I find Bloomberg's candidacy problematic: He has yet to make a real case, or face voters, or hold a town hall, and yet his campaign spending has vaulted him into a top spot.  Persuading voters should take more than money. #Bloomberg   https://t.co/C8xCVlwqM4<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Aren't you happy they "voted" to have a 15-minute recess? Were you surprised that the Republicans did not want to break?  As a lifelong educator and writer who held many events, 90 minutes was the &gt;longest possible segment&lt; without a bio-break. #ImpeachingHearing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What articles of impeachment could be drawn against this President? What's the evidence?  Here's David Leonhardt, summarizing the possible. #Impeachment    https://t.co/8LzYOJOi6G<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Calling acts against your nation "baloney" discredits the speaker himself. Name-calling is no defense. Neither is lying.  Republicans should address the actual indications and evidence for impeachment--not whine about process or name-call. #ImpeachmentHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Evidence of Trump himself, on video, soliciting election interference from foreign nations.  #ImpeachmentHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Extremely important point.  #ImpeachmentHearings  #ImpeachmentHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"There have been excuses offered by the President..." --Barry Berke  Yes, they are excuses.   And there's no excuse for a President acting in his own political interests with a foreign power, rather than in the nation's best interests.  #ImpeachmentHearings #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What does Rep. Collins think he's accomplishing? From this perspective, he's disgracing himself publicly for no real end. Same for Biggs and Gaetz.  All these GOP interruptions seem like obvious and childish attempts to wrest power from the Chair. #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good points. Let's remember them.  Because Trump indeed had motive, means, &amp; opportunity...and he used the power of the Presidency to press for &gt;personal advantage&lt;, not to advance the interests of the US.  #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If there's a cogent argument to be made about Trump's conduct with #Ukraine, let's hear it. But Republicans seem to have no argument.  All they can say is that some people don't like the President. Hardly a defense.  So much whining.  Not much winning. #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here Trump is, entertaining the notion of never leaving office, in case you were skeptical. Yes, he wants to become the first #AmericanDictator.   https://t.co/GSXL1DWfMx<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>There's no doubt that our State Dept. insists to foreign nations that dissent about the United States will not be tolerated and praise for Trump is the surest way to gain influence.

<|startoftext|>As an amateur genealogist, I'm appalled by this.  The people's records should be available to the public at low or no cost. There's no good reason for hiking costs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Allowing the personal attorney to the President to share US secrets is a national security threat. And this is just ONE small aspect of US national security this administration risks.  Aiding and abetting adversaries against the United States used to be called treasonous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why determining reliability of sources is acutely important:  "The internet was supposed to shine the light of truth into every corner of the world, breaking the authoritarians' monopoly on information. But it has also become a light-speed delivery system of lies and propaganda."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What has happened to #Republicans? They prove they do not appreciate the Constitutional reasons for the separation of powers through this poll--and that they've embraced a cult of personality that could lead to dictatorship.  Yet another reason to defeat them at the ballot box.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How could anyone consider re-electing a man whose word no one can trust?  Trump is a known #liar. That he lies to the American people, regularly, daily, should be disqualifying in itself. He violates the public trust and therefore his oath.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These attacks on expertise are part of the larger attempt to discredit truth itself. For people who demand respect, Trump's surrogates rarely grant it to their betters.  Just b/c you don't like someone's opinion doesn't reduce its expertise. Resentment isn't rebuttal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I watch Republicans' performance in hearings, it's striking to view their utter lack of appreciation &amp; understanding for the oaths they've taken to protect &amp; defend the #Constitution.  Citizenship test for candidates for Congress, in order to protect it? May be necessary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She made a critical distinction.  Republicans keep claiming that Democrats hate the President. But the #ImpeachmentInquiry identified violations of the #Constitution in Trump's repeated attempts to cheat using foreign election interference, which are threats to #democracy itself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nepotism and profiting from the Presidency are the point of calling Biden‚Äôs son, so it‚Äôs logical to bring up Trump administration ongoing #corruption.    House hearings may not get the media coverage Senate hearings get, though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thoroughly offended that Rep. McClintock asked the witnesses to reveal their 2016 Presidential election vote.  We purposely vote by secret ballot.  Whether they supported Trump or Clinton has no bearing on their expert testimony ab. the Constitution. #ImpeachmentHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"It's not about hating this President. It's about our love for this country." -- Rep. Cicciline  This is the counter to the GOP's assertion that Democrats hate Trump.

<|startoftext|>Typical of Trump's defense, one that Republicans seem blind to.  Pressuring a government as part of negotiations for mutual international policy = diplomacy.  Pressuring a foreign government to interfere in US elections--a political purpose--is not diplomacy. #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even though Rep. Collins tried to defame the Founders, their intentions come from historical records. Scholars are not "merely speculating". They read, study, and draw conclusions based those records.  It's why scholars can testify to the Framers' intentions.  #ImpeachingHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I literally applauded when I heard Prof. Karlan testify to the sovereignty of our elections and the importance of prohibiting foreign interference.

<|startoftext|>This is a critical talking point among Trump's defenders.  Agreed: A statutory crime is unnecessary for impeachment. #ImpeachingHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Trump's trying to play #NATO as a venue for his stand-up routine? He thinks his "jokes" make him look clever?  Not sure I'll ever understand the reality Trump lives in.

<|startoftext|>House #JudiciaryCommittee Ranking Member Collins falsely claims that there are no facts in the case.  He didn't do the reading.

<|startoftext|>And sure enough, in the days following that single visit to the dealer's showroom, I have come down with a serious respiratory infection that could keep me away from my family during the holiday. It's already altered our plans. 7/x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After leaving the showroom, I was eager to use hand sanitizer and get away from all their germs. So was my partner. But we had to wait around for a couple of things to happen. (long story) 6/x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But that explained, in a nutshell, why the car sales people had come to work sick. They weren't going to make a sale if they stayed at home with that week-long virus. They may not have been able to feed their families, either. And the holidays are coming up. 5/x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In Illinois, minimum wage is $8.25/hr. So if these car salesmen don't sell a car, they're taking home $330 for the week.  I understand how sales incentives work; both my parents and my brother were lifelong sales people.  But, honestly, I was still shocked. 4/x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The salesman we'd been working with had earlier explained something I did not know prior to our visit to this dealership.  These employees work for minimum wage and commission! 3/x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The ill person was coughing and had a red nose, as if he'd been blowing his nose for hours if not days.  I excused myself and left the room because I have asthma and respiratory infections can put me in the hospital. 2/x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Short thread. Last week I went with someone to a car dealership. After we'd been there for a while, the salesman mentioned that "something had been going around" at the dealership. Later a very ill employee worked w/us. 1/x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Aawojo Individuals need to keep up the pressure. It‚Äôs unconscionable not to. But the press must use their power too, to continually highlight these injustices. These family separations and child detentions must end‚Äîhuman rights violations the US never would have previously tolerated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Aawojo This is a horrifying thread. Cannot get over the fact that it‚Äôs OUR government enabling these terrible acts and outcomes. Brings me to tears.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are they afraid of books?   They‚Äôre proof that the pen is mightier than the sword‚Äîand that lawmakers understand their value.   It‚Äôs truly an outrage that inmates are being charged to read or visit virtually with their families. Something is rotten in West Virginia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cannot get over this either.   We recently watched a documentary called Hitler‚Äôs Final Days, which shows video of the camps, murders, items made from human skin, and stacks of bodies. We must #NeverForget those horrors and vow never to duplicate such discrimination and genocide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most of the political ads I'm seeing here locally are from  #billionaires running for the Democratic nomination for President.  When only billionaires can buy their way to a nomination, something's gone very wrong with our democratic republic.   We need campaign finance reform.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What we've been saying all along.  Good to see the court agrees.   https://t.co/MffoTlvRNu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This decision is essential to the Constitution's separation of powers.   Expecting an appeal.   https://t.co/56RAVnc7XG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Important question to ask Mayor Bloomberg &amp; anyone in the 1% running for President:  How will you divest your assets if you become President? Release your taxes + divestment plan.  Americans deserve to know their President will work for the country, not to enrich himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Important debate between Bret Stephens and Anand Girihadharadas.  Read Girihadharadas' thread and watch these segments. #Billionaires  #Plutocracy   https://t.co/D5ocA4zw8M<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump made the same argument and then went on to use the power of the Presidency for his personal enrichment.  NOT a compelling argument at all, Mr. Bloomberg. Hardly convincing. Ours is a government of, by, and for the people--all of them--not of, by, and for #Billionaires.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's up with #TrumpsHealth, after an unannounced visit to #WalterReedHospital?  1) There is no such thing as a "phased physical exam" 2) Doctors are following him around 3) He's working from the residence 4) He isn't golfing  Dr. Sanjay Gupta's analysis.  https://t.co/xV3d7js1WR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The scale of these conflicts of interest is staggering.  ANY candidate for President in 2020 must issue a divestment plan in advance of the election.   How will Americans know if the President is working only for himself--or for the American people, as we have a right to expect?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LesliesBookcase @Leslie4848 Thanks for the summary!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why we still need independent inspections. The Trump administration wants to let the industry police itself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another action that meets Putin‚Äôs goals.  Trump‚Äôs claims about NATO are absurd. Putin wants to destabilize a long and successful alliance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Read this thread. Please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Congress doesn‚Äôt hold Trump accountable, it could find its power of the purse diminished and its ability to know what he‚Äôs doing with US foreign policy annihilated. Here‚Äôs another example of his abuse of power.  #impeachment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Leslie4848 Not planning to read it so I‚Äôm relying on your review! üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As usual, Trump blames others for something his administration was responsible for.  And how petty that he wants to 'hang' the portrait issue, caused by his people, on a female diplomat. Petty, just like the man making the accusation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why a tease? What's happening in the US is no board game. The public needs to hear what Bolton has to say.  Don't ruin reputation and legacy when democracy is at stake by playing a hide-and-seek game.  The patriotic act would be to come forward and testify. #Impeachment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jon Meacham on @MSNBC talking with @NicolleDWallace about historical Presidencies and the role of the office is quite succinct about the perennial tensions between political parties and US foreign policy.  "What Trump has done is scrambled the consensus." #Presidency<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djrothkopf @anneapplebaum All of the counter-intelligence elements of the Mueller investigation remain murky. So it has not been explained fully to the American people, IMHO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been wondering about this myself. Shame that Mueller did not allow the counter-intelligence elements of his investigation (if they investigated those) to become public.  Mueller's work seems unfinished, or Americans were not afforded full access. #Impeachment  #MuellerReport<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In fact, that's one definition of tragedy--when a person's character flaws lead to his downfall.   And it is indeed Shakespearean. Think of a play such as Coriolanus. #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This morning there's not enough coffee to fully wake me up. This week in news + politics has been exhausting and it's not over. I'm a retiree. Those of you still working must be very tired too.  But we're living history. Stay engaged. #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Obviously Trump is worried about the Senate trial.  Imagine a defendant holding lunch meetings with the jury who will decide his fate.  #impeachment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here's a clip of her opening statement. #ImpeachmentHearings    https://t.co/JiiIFIYjGa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you wish to read Dr. Hill's opening statement in full, here's the link: #ImpeachmentHearings    https://t.co/tYHpZVhHGO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Worth posting, from Dr. Fiona Hill's opening statement today. She cautions Congress persons NOT to repeat clearly false narratives about #Ukraine or #Russia.  #ImpeachmentHearings  https://t.co/RzOZZSiHlh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If only all involved in the #UkraineScandal could state their objectives this clearly and remain determined that exposing the truth was their only goal...  #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holmes' opening statement undercuts the #Ukraine conspiracy theories promoted by Trump, Guiliani, and other Trump supporters, including Nunes. Holmes attended meetings with Trump admin. officials in the country.  Can't wait to hear his additional testimony. #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nunes' opening statement proves that HE got caught--advancing conspiracy theories, telling lies, smearing witnesses and others, and falsifying the concerns of his political opponents.  He's so incompetent and shameless that he should resign from Congress.  #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can these guys ever check themselves?  Buttigieg, Steyer, and &gt;especially&lt; Sanders are hectoring some of the time too. Somehow that NEVER gets mentioned by people who claim that women lecture them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tonight's moderators were excellent.  They kept the debate moving, insisted candidates answer  questions asked, and didn't encourage sensationalism or in-fighting.  Bravo to @AshleyRParker @kwelkernbc @mitchellreports @maddow. Do this again, please. Thanks.  #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Buttigieg addressed voting rights.  Klobuchar notes she has 11 bills in the Senate on voting rights and election integrity. She says she thinks "experience should matter".  Buttigieg counters that combined experience on the  stage has gotten us where we are now. #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Booker brings voting rights and voter suppression into the #DemocraticDebate. Thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warren: Abortion rights are human rights. Abortion rights are economic rights. Government should not be in the middle of her decision.  #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On abortion rights: Klobuchar: "We should codify Roe v Wade into law."  #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wish I could reproduce Booker's comments on race, marijuana, and law enforcement. He was passionate. Noted that he knows a lot ab. blacks voting since he's been a black voter since he was 18.  Look for his comments online later.  #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warren when asked about the border wall shifts to this:  Trump destabilized the governments in Central America, talks about family separation at the border, and then says:  "A great nation does not separate children from their families."  #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Harris is turning in a strong performance.  "Justice is on the ballot."  Indeed.  #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still would like to hear questions on -election interference &amp; election integrity -voting rights -women's health -federal debt and deficits -gun violence  #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Buttigieg mentioned that Trump is "relying on 17th century technologies, like a wall and a moat", when talking about military spending.  Got quite a laugh locally.  #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Booker's comments on human rights were definitely needed in tonight's #DemocraticDebate on the topic of foreign policy.  #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Taking a short break from Twitter commentary on the #DemocraticDebate.  It's been a long and tiring day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Harris re: North Korea:  "Donald Trump got punked."  Goes on to criticize Trump's foreign policy. She would not make concessions to the North Koreans.  Harris is quite emphatic on the loss of respect for the US on the national stage. #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sanders says that we must tell the fossil fuel industry that their profits are not more important than the future of the planet. #ClimateCrisis   #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another memorable comment from Amy:   https://t.co/Vijl0aFhwi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Steyer states that #climate is the No. 1 issue.  He would use emergency powers as President to fight it.  Believes it could be unifying for the nation.  #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maddow asks about farm subsidies. HUGE issue here in the Midwest.  Buttigieg says the trade war should not have been started to begin with. Mentions reducing farm monopolies and agricultural markets. Says he'll "fix the trade war".  #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Booker on housing affordability: Plans a refundable tax credit for renters paying greater than 1/3 of their income on housing.  #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Steyer addresses housing affordability.  Not sure exactly how he can do it as President and he was not particularly specific about his ideas.  #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Harris says the party is focused on the future.  On family leave Harris notes that raising young children and caring for parents is a common challenge whose  "burden principally falls on women" and forces them to make hard choices, esp. when women are paid less. #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klobuchar on paid family leave notes she has a plan--and how she'll pay for it--on her website.  Notes that Trump is putting the country in a worse financial condition "every day", referring to debt. We have an obligation as a party to be fiscally responsible.  #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Paid family leave. Great question.  Yang wants to support families "from the beginning". He has an autistic child and knows the challenges. Does not promote a specific plan in this debate, though.  #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent point on the rule of law by Biden. He would not direct the DOJ to investigate Trump; he'd want the DOJ to make an independent judgment.  #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Booker's charm cannot be denied. He's smart, he's successful, and he's unifying.  A mystery why he hasn't garnered greater support.  #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden's got the strongest argument on experience, especially when it comes to foreign policy.  #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Klobuchar's comments ab. her experience and her winning record in elections do commend her.  Kudos re: her comments about Pelosi, too.  #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mitchell asks about Buttigieg's experience.  He does not have national experience...and the President must run a huge federal bureaucracy and work with Congress. He has never done any of that. I don't buy his argument.  Wish he would run for Congress first.   #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gabbard's criticism of the Democrats is tired and inaccurate. She has, as Harris notes, spent quite a lot of time criticizing the party on Fox News.  Also very concerned that she's the candidate that's lauded by RT and Putin. (Why is that?)  #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Leslie4848 Very tired. I have watched all the hearings, with some breathers, but tonight's debate may be my breaking point.  How about you, Leslie?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warren's vision seems inspiring yet Booker seems very skeptical of a wealth tax as the path forward. Yet he doesn't have a quick response to advance his own plan.  #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump doesn't want me to be the nominee. --Biden  No kidding.  But Mitchell asked about working across the aisle with current Republicans and he failed to answer that. #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My thread during the #DemocraticDebate.  Hoping to keep it short.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djrothkopf Definitely a long, exhausting day.   [In the retiree marathon, metaphorically speaking: Hobbling along with my cane and wishing I'd ridden a mobility scooter instead.]<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have been watching political hearings or reading news for an entire day, punctuated by one errand.  It's been exhausting for me as an observer. And it's not over. #DemocraticDebate in 15 minutes!  For anyone working within politics or journalism today, my sympathies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course this one works too. #TheThreeAmigos   #ImpeachmentHearings  #sondlandtestimony  https://t.co/9WprpJEibh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every time they mention The Three Amigos, this is the image in my mind.  #ImpeachmentHearings  #sondlandtestimony<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nunes just cannot get his facts straight on this.  The aid to #Ukraine was withheld in spite of certification. According to testimony, Mulvaney and the OMB were responsible for the order to withhold it. #ImpeachmentHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No need to fantasize ab. Watergate.  I lived thru those hearings. What we're seeing, hearing, &amp; reading ab. today is far worse, more damning, &amp; more criminal than a bungled break-in of the DNC. Trump enlisted a foreign nation to interfere w/US elections for his personal gain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the President simply cannot claim to be ignorant of what they were doing on his behalf.  #ImpeachmentHearing  #Sondland  #sondlandtestimony<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good point here.  #Ukraine  #ImpeachmentHearing   https://t.co/53T4C705HI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also stunning: #ImpeachmentHearing    https://t.co/sQRWpcyX28<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump used his plausible deniability--"I want nothing", which Sondland testified Trump had said--to distance himself from the conspiracy to obtain 2020 election interference in exchange for aid to #Ukraine.  This is Trump trying to de-couple himself from all others! Astonishing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MMcHarry This is also "discredit the witness' testimony" from Castor, picking away at the discrepancies in #sondlandtestimony.  He's drawing out Sondland's inability to recall his phone conversations with various other witnesses and parties to the #Ukraine situation.  #ImpeachmentHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MMcHarry Caster's doing his very best to de-couple Trump &amp; Guiliani. He's hammering Sondland on not having a directive from Trump's own mouth... This is the "the Don didn't actually say" what they all knew was being asked for, and what was being withheld.  #ImpeachmentHearing  #Sondland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nunes is effectively using his questioning to add questionable and dubious "facts" to the record.  #ImpeachmentHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The "drug deal" Nunes mentioned was &gt;&gt; a Bolton analogy &lt;&lt;, not anything a Democrat said.  Nunes should resign his Congressional seat. He's stunningly incompetent.  #ImpeachmentHearing  #sondlandtestimony<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whether Trump thinks Ukraine was "out to get him", as Nunes asserts doesn't absolve Trump in the criminal nature of asking for interference in the 2020 election and using taxpayer funds as leverage.  #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here we go with the debunked conspiracy theories from Nunes ... again.  Obviously Sondland knows nothing about them, b/c they're made up.  #ImpeachmentHearings #sondlandtestimony<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MMcHarry Doesn't mean they won't try.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes.  As we return to the #sondlandtestimony, after this break, I'd expect Republicans to try to de-couple Trump from Guiliani...even though that QPQ statement shows consciousness of guilt.  #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"at the express direction of the President"  #ImpeachmentHearings    https://t.co/4mJYAcVUJx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sondland said he never heard from Pres. Trump that aid was conditioned. Yet he also testified he was working on orders directly from the President. Apparently he meant through Guiliani?  At this point in testimony, Sondland actually said "Guiliani/Trump". #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3rd option: He doesn't comprehend the significance of his involvement in a conspiracy to defraud the United States, which multiple people involved w/Trump have been indicted for. Withholding taxpayer funds for personal ends could fit that charge. #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is hard to believe, considering everything else Sondland has said and everything that others testified to.  OTOH, Sondland seems to be trying to be fulsome in his testimony. Perhaps his naivet√© in diplomacy was at work here?  #ImpeachmentHearings  #sondlandtestimony<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This seems like the appropriate word for what Sondland has been describing in his testimony.  #ImpeachmentHearings #sondlandtestimony  https://t.co/8IrfCLerXd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sondland's testimony blows this investigation wide open.  He repeats "Everyone was in the loop" several times to emphasize that what they were doing was authorized at the highest levels--by the President and some cabinet members.  #ImpeachmentHearings #sondlandtestimony<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Email to Pompeo, Perry, McCormick, McKenna, Mulvaney, Blair assured them that the investigation of Biden would go forward to secure a phone call between Zelenskyy and Trump.  "Everyone was in the loop. Everyone was on the email of July 19." #ImpeachmentHearings #sondlandtestimony<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This seems significant: #ImpeachmentHearings  #sondlandtestimony   https://t.co/UzcDciLdt4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sondland names names, goes to the heart of the scheme and its coverup, the "shadow diplomacy", provides missing details...plus his Kyiv restaurant call.  This testimony is what Americans need to hear, although I still have many questions.  #ImpeachmentHearings #sondlandtestimony<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sondland just claimed that what they did--advancing Trump's demand for an investigation into an American citizen in order to help Trump's 2020 re-election campaign--was &gt;official US foreign policy&lt;!  #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gordon Sondland's statement begins.  He is well-aware that others have been indicted for perjury.  #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I literally laughed out loud when he said this.  #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelLillich I have voted for local Republicans from time to time; even occasionally for state offices, but longer ago. Never again.  The party isn't merely sullied. It's shown itself as self-serving and fundamentally corrupt. Affiliation with that cannot be tolerated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clearly, that #Republicans cannot grasp the idea of selfless service to something larger than oneself has been an eye-opener.  Makes me re-consider support for any candidate running under their banner, now or in future. These Reps have utterly ruined their brand's reputation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a very weak defense/propaganda technique to resort to name-calling.  As we continue thru these #ImpeachmentHearings, recommended reading:  "The Baloney Detection Kit: Carl Sagan‚Äôs Rules for Bullsh*t-Busting and Critical Thinking"  https://t.co/pF9YCaY7f5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The reason that we don't ask fact witnesses to the make the judgment of whether bribery has been committed is that it's OUR job to make that judgment. -- Rep. Schiff  Correct. #ImpeachmentHearings gather facts, timelines, and narratives to determine whether wrongdoing occurred.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As others have said, the #Whistleblower is NOT the point of this #ImpeachmentHearing.  Williams and Vindman have first-hand knowledge about the calls with Zelensky + Trump's policies in #Ukraine.  If Republicans want to get the facts, they could use their time appropriately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously dangerous. The more we hear, the more parallels to gangster-like activity we see.   Now witnesses and their families require protection--from their government's cult-like "defenders".  Stunning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. That line of questioning is a dodge.  Withholding Congressionally-appropriated foreign aid until a foreign country obeys your demand to act to benefit a political campaign is very different from an aversion to 'burden sharing'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Truly despicable of Nunes to try to "out" the #Whistleblower by questioning a public witness.  #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Important note:  That Nunes is promoting these conspiracy theories on national TV gives them a credibility they did not previously have in the mainstream.  Witnesses must counter with their knowledge and facts throughout the questioning. #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lynnsweet It is &gt;illegal&lt; to ask a foreign nation for help with US elections, as FEC Chair Weintraub has repeatedly emphasized.  If the #ImpeachmentInquiry shows that, it's no challenge at all. Nor would it be partisan or bureaucratic undermining.  https://t.co/iuLh32SOKG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AGAIN. Journalists: STOP parroting WH statements without corroboration. That is such a disservice to the public.  https://t.co/wzqmYco941<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And another fact witness.  Good grief, journalists. Do your jobs and stop simply repeating what this WH says. We all KNOW they lie.   https://t.co/HjXr9oIeXO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here's a fact witness who denies the Press Sec's assertion.   https://t.co/oTZ54xjnBp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG. Reporting this w/o evidence seems to be journalistic malpractice.  We know this WH lies. I would not take anything they say as true without corroboration by multiple witnesses.  #Liars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The risks the witnesses are taking...Already hearing that they're losing their positions in the WH for testifying.  Their devotion to their oaths to the Constitution should inspire us.   https://t.co/G9PuUfAfgi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quite telling.  And definitely poignant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Advice to Americans: This week we are all witnesses to history.  Watch the actual #ImpeachmentHearings rather than watching only commentary about them.  Read written testimony. (Record/download as necessary.) Evaluate for yourself. #Ukraine #UkraineScandal #BriberyAndExtortion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CKGlamper Sorry it seemed misleading. Wasn't intentional.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CKGlamper It's the location, not the meeting itself. It's rare for Presidents to hold meetings with the Chairman of the Fed. It's even more rare to hold a substantive meeting like this in the residence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Election interference and cheating (by authorizing a break-in at your opponents political party headquarters and then covering that crime up) were actual political power grabs.  Trying to rewrite that well-documented history is absurd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Concerning that meeting w/Powell &amp; Mnuchin 1) was not on President's official schedule 2) too place in the WH residence not in West Wing  Both indicators that Trump may not be well.  Will Americans ever learn FACTS ab. Trump's health?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it matters what happens in Iowa or New Hampshire because those states are not representative of the country anymore,‚Äù the longtime Nevada senator said."--Harry Reid  Finally, some truth ab. these early states.  @TheDemocrats, what say you?   https://t.co/cLH6LNbF5y<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Experience matters.  Mayor Pete's a rising star, no question. Wishing he would run for a seat (in Senate or House) on the national stage, learn ab. Congress from inside. Then come back to the Presidency later.  Now, after Trump, we need experienced national leadership.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's who's testifying this week, and when. #ImpeachmentHearings   https://t.co/x9vuIOteDc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump: "There's never been a president as tough on Russia as I have been."  But that claim is simply false, based on Trump's actions over the last few years. Here's a full breakdown of 25 occasions when Trump was soft on Russia or gave Putin a boost.  https://t.co/I4jslCCBod<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Republicans‚Äô lies are so numerous and obvious that one requires only a minimal amount of fact-checking to see that they lie because they have no truthful factual defenses nor valid constitutional argument." --Jennifer Rubin #Liars   https://t.co/R5w6DE0i4A<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Allan Lichtman correctly predicted every presidential election since Ronald Reagan in 1984.   In his same 2016 prediction that Donald Trump would win, Lichtman also predicted he‚Äôd be just the third president ever to be impeached. Watch this discussion:  https://t.co/vyJZVbppHo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Definitely has me worried.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If it had been merely 'routine', it would have been handled at the WH. Going to #WalterReedHospital  without any advance notice gives the impression of an emergency.  The explanation given by @PressSec strains credulity.  Americans deserve better, and honest, information.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Iowa is not representative of US demographics or of the Democratic party at large. Neither is New Hampshire. Why do Democrats hold early primaries in states that are so unrepresentative?  Why, @Democrats?  Mystifying also why polls from unrepresentative states matter so much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Several 2020 candidates are in their 70s. It's possible to have your health decline at that age.  -President made a secret hospital visit -Candidate had a heart attack  Thus: It is imperative that Americans understand the medical conditions of candidates for President + VP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Americans deserve to know if the President has medical issues.  Following its pattern of regularly obscuring truth, citizens cannot believe what any WH spokesperson says. @PressSec shouldn't be surprised ab. our skepticism re: her statements. The WH has burned credibility.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Questioning our government is an important right that Americans cherish. The government belongs &gt;to the people&lt;, not to an autocrat and his minions. That's why we love our Constitution, which enshrines those rights.  @PressSec should be ashamed of making this outrageous claim.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wow, @HawkeyeFootball! What an upset! Congrats!  #BigTen football.  Love this conference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Standard for Trump to deny, deflect, disparage, and defend whenever he's called on his dishonesty.  He also accuses others of the wrongdoing he's committed.  Trump proves, on a daily basis, that he cannot be trusted. Allowing him to run our government can only damage the country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pence no doubt knew + did nothing to stop Trump from using taxpayer funds as bribery to help their re-election campaign--abetting foreign interference in the 2020 election.

<|startoftext|>What ever happened to the idea of the #WorthyOpponent? Respecting an opponent's strength elevates a contest.  Lying ab. those who disagree with you, believing that will gain advantage, has always been the dishonorable path.  Barr's speech degrades him and the office of the AG.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well... We suspected this. Now, confirmation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always impressed by the guests on @DeadlineWH with @NicolleDWallace.  So happy to listen in, after today's testimony by Marie Yovanovitch during the #ImpeachmentHearing, since I could not watch the whole hearing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still mystified ab. #Republicans' obsession with the #Whistleblower.  It's illegal to provide identifying information about him/her. Why do they insist they need to break the law?   [Seems to me that they want revenge on the person who reported wrongdoing.] #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beyond the comprehension of people who have lived through many presidencies &amp; are committed to the Constitution which outlines three co-equal branches of government of, by, and for the people.  We fought a revolution to get out from under a monarchy. We won't return to one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Story below:  https://t.co/js1VZTKN0V<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Roger Stone was convicted on 7 counts:  "Stone was found guilty on five counts of lying to Congress, one of witness tampering, and one of obstructing a Congressional committee proceeding."  A warning to those testifying before Congress.  #ImpeachingHearings #LyingtoCongress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Suggesting that the US was not a powerful nation before Trump is simply untrue. I've lived thru many presidencies. American power was not deflated before Trump, nor was it inflated by him.  WHY Yovanovitch was removed is at issue. He fails to give his reasons. #ImpeachmentHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The synchronicity of her removal along with Trump's comment that "she's going to go through some things" sent chills up my spine.  The threat seems clear enough to me.   Running a campaign of terror toward an American diplomat? THAT'S #Corruption &amp; #Criminal.  #ImpeachmentHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yovanovitch is quite a skilled advocate for United States foreign service.   Americans are indebted to her and all those like her.  #ImpeachingHearings #ForeignService<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everything she recounted and this:   https://t.co/fSODjDSkTh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to Yovanovitch's family history gave me chills.  Her devotion to our country emerged from the legacy of immigrants.  #ImpeachmentHearing #Immigrants<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These efforts to interrupt the hearing are irritating.  All I want--as a citizen--is to hear the witness' testimony.  These Republicans seem desperate to stop her testimony from happening. #ImpeachingHearings<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ooh. A bill banning forced arbitration! Yes!  Now if @senatemajldr would consider just some of these bills, including HR1423, Americans would appreciate that.  Why do you have a legislative graveyard, Mr. McConnell? Get to work. Stop stonewalling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beagle_betsy @democrats If Democrats don't flip the Senate or the Presidency, it will continue into Trump's second term.  That's my point. We can't change what's already happened. We can prevent further damage if the Senate goes to Democrats in 2020.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fellow, @Democrats. THIS is why we need to flip the Senate.  McConnell has been nominating, and Republicans have been confirming, unqualified people to be lifetime judges, which will remake our judiciary for a long time. We cannot let them continue this trend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly what I fear.  Yet it's also important to defend the truth and deflect lies. That's why these disinformation campaigns are insidious and evil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McFaul It's most revealing about the speaker, Dowd, and shows what he values.  Yes, it's beyond the pale to disparage Taylor's years of dedicated service to our country just to try to find some way to defend what cannot be defended--Trump's continuing corrupt conduct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How shallow do you have to be to call an historic investigation into a President's #Corruption--an event that could lead to his removal from office--'boring'?  It's a tell:  Republicans hoped for a circus b/c They have no real defense for Trump's conduct. #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Correct. Trump's #corruption must have consequences or he will continue and even expand it.  More importantly, the precedent would change the nature of the Presidency, altering the balance of powers among its co-equal branches and the nature of American democracy itself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is horrifying.  And I've read that Republicans want to run in 2020 on MORE tax cuts, just like the ones that increased this #Deficit. They're downright irresponsible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a day for Trump! -#ImpeachmentHearings - 1st day -Court rules Congress can seek his tax records<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump becomes angry about the messengers who report his wrongdoing. Thus, he wants to "out" the #Whistleblower and fire the IG.  Trump wants to retaliate against those who report his wrongdoing--and intimidate anyone else who knows about it. Mob boss conduct. #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cannot stop thinking about... If there is no consequence to Trump for what he did with #Ukraine, he's not only likely to do that again, or worse.  Trump requires consequences to keep his impulse toward absolute executive power--authoritarianism--in check. #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow.  Implication: Trump was not promoting US national interests--he was promoting his own personal ones.  #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump has access to premier investigatory intelligence agencies + State diplomats who could have easily helped him.  Instead he sent the Three Amigos to ask a foreign nation to do political work for him, holding taxpayer-funded aid as leverage. #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rep. Jordan's "questioning" is simply more shrill grandstanding. He has a talking point and he's determined to run it into the ground. #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Timeline of the aid release. #ImpeachmentHearings    https://t.co/Xjq4y3hraO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone who has watched a police procedural on TV knows: Trying to commit a crime but failing is still a crime.  Ex: Attempted [crime] is still a crime.  Whether this administration got what it wanted isn't the issue. They tried to extort. That's it. #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THIS.  The aid was released after the #Whistleblower complaint became known and the scheme to extort were revealed.  #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Attacking the integrity and expertise of witnesses is the #Republicans' approach to fact-finding. SMDH  #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still hating the 5-minute MoC questioning time limits.  Terrible format. So fragmented.  #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Note:   https://t.co/2z42H5Ag03<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Questioning ab. Hunter Biden has nothing to do with the matter at hand, and these witnesses prove they have no knowledge of his activities on a corporate board.   So this is the GOP method for presenting their pet (debunked) conspiracy theory. #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can Nunes assert that Democrats are making things up?  Did he not listen to Kent and Taylor who just testified? This isn't about Democrats. Distractions and diversions. #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Particularly important to keep in mind:  https://t.co/kpMiJFimsw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, Trump exploited Ukraine's vulnerabilities--a new, naive President PLUS Russian aggression--by conditioning aid to Ukraine for his own political benefit.  Taylor's testimony is devastating to Trump.  #Ukraine #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kent is systematically undermining all the administration's defenses on the #UkraineScandal. This is a masterful opening statement.  #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are #Republicans going to interrupt the proceedings with parliamentary (and other) inquiries throughout the #ImpeachmentHearings as a regular feature?  Seems like their method is to interrupt in order to delay a consistent narrative to emerge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad but true.  Impeachment is such a solemn undertaking. Evidence is presented for review and analysis, not as political warfare.  Anyone involved should consider how serious it is and not prejudge. #ImpeachmentInquiry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One principle being tested by these #ImpeachmentHearings:  Should the President of the United States  use foreign policy and taxpayer funds  for his sole personal political benefit?  We once believed that the answer was obviously NO. [#Republicans now seem to think otherwise.]<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every time I turn on Morning Joe, I recall why I so rarely do so. Not that other networks are doing better.  &gt;What I want is serious reporting, historical perspective, and truly insightful commentary.&lt;  Why is that so hard to find? #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"When do #Republicans decide that having a mob boss for President is not a good look?" -- Nicolle Wallace today on @DeadlineWH.  Excellent question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whenever Trump doesn't like something that's codified into law, he either tries to find a way around it or retaliate for *lawful actions* taken.  Another obvious instance of revenge on someone for doing his job. Appalling.  &gt;&gt;Innocent people do not behave like this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Waltzing into a Democratic primary race at the last minute like you deserve to be there (b/c of your wealth or celebrity, for ex.) is an insult to everyone. It tells Americans you don't believe you need to work hard for their votes but can enter the race due to your privilege.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tired of hearing "due process" arguments from #Republicans. What's happening in the House right now is an investigation. Due process applies to the trial, which occurs in the Senate.

<|startoftext|>If #Republicans had evidence to dispute the #UkraineScandal, they would have brought it forward.  They have nothing. And they know it.  Whatever they do is designed to distract from facts: Trump tried to use taxpayer $ to extort a scam investigation into his political rival.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everything in the whistleblower's account has been verified by multiple first-hand witnesses.  Yet Trump &amp; enablers want to "out" the #Whistleblower.  Why?  1) To distract from Trump's wrongdoing. 2) To get revenge.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Incoherent. He knows he‚Äôs caught. Can‚Äôt use his typical tactics to wiggle out of this one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump &amp; family should have anticipated their "sacrifices" before Trump filed to run. The public has no obligation to admire that choice. Trump wanted the Presidency to wield power, settle scores, + feed his ego.  Not enviable; not admirable; not pitiable either.  Give us a break.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>&gt;A judge has ruled that the President is incapable of running a charity w/o outside oversight.&lt;  No wrongdoing puts off #Republicans. There's nothing they won't excuse.  Thus: #Republicans don't know what ethics are or why they're necessary. That is a true danger to the country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beagle_betsy Studied literature. No need to re-read that one. Its epigraph is a tip-off of intent and a tongue in cheek one at that. Just like the judge‚Äôs admonition.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@beagle_betsy @LindseyGrahamSC @senatemajldr After McConnell's declaration today that he'd acquit even before viewing all the evidence, it would appear that #Republicans have decided to abandon the rule of law.

<|startoftext|>Again, @LindseyGrahamSC and @senatemajldr have decided -- before hearing or reading all the evidence -- how they will decide the verdict of a trial.  Where's their consideration of #DueProcess now? The very thing #Republicans were up-in-arms about?  Shocking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What jury decides the verdict in any trial before viewing all the evidence? That's what @senatemajldr has done.  Why aren't #Republicans crying over due process regarding McConnell's declaration?  This is shocking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Americans need to know what @VP Mike Pence knew ab.

<|startoftext|>Calling an #ImpeachmentInquiry "illegitimate" to excuse not complying with legal subpoenas is a weak pretext. Congress has the Constitutional right for the inquiry.

<|startoftext|>Yes. Trump keeps trying to keep the focus on a single phone call's read-out (which may not even be complete).   Yet Trump and his surrogates worked for months, if not years, to pressure Ukraine. The #ImpeachmentInquiry is about corruption, conspiracy, and extortion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still not understanding how can subpoenas can be ignored.   Mystifying how some people can choose what laws apply to them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Notice how Trump gets fixated on the origin story? The "who started it" part?  Like, now it's the #Whistleblower. Or it's the LTC who listened to the call. Or it was the #dossier.

<|startoftext|>He promotes exaggerations and lies. He challenges actual facts. He amplifies dubious conspiracy theories. He inflames others' fears. He spreads paranoia. He has undermined the public trust.  These are just some of the impacts of Trump's Twitter feed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ukraine buries investigations related to Manafort, a convicted criminal with known connections to other potential criminals...and Donald J. Trump.  Hmm...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If he's going to simply confess to crimes this readily, cannot wait to listen in to his "fireside chat".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not entirely surprised, since Trump will do anything at all to save himself, but shocked nevertheless.  What President--ever--has enlisted the help of foreign governments to discredit US intelligence?  Treason needs to be redefined.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Absolute immunity" when there's potential criminality + an #ImpeachmentInquiry that could lead to the removal of the President is absurd. Executive privilege does not apply to illegal activity.  Shocked that any competent attorney would have the nerve to make the argument.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Trump inflates numbers again, even tho he gets the report before the public.  ‚û°Ô∏èNonfarm payrolls rose by 128,000 in Oct. ‚û°Ô∏è42,000 jobs lost, due to the GM strike ‚û°Ô∏èUnemployment rate up slightly, 3.6% from 3.5% ‚û°Ô∏èJobs est. up from prev months' estimates  https://t.co/uuQ2tYNLVX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Short-term thinking is Trump's forte.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are so many witnesses confirming the whistleblower's account?  Not because it was some sort of deviation from ordinary process.  It's because they knew what Trump did was wrong.  It is illegal to bribe foreign officials to interfere in US elections. #UkraineScandal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump pledged to eliminate the national debt within eight years.   In his ~3 yrs in office, the US debt has grown $3 trillion more. It rose 15%, from $19.9  to $22.9 trillion, according to latest  Treasury Department figures.  #NationalDebt #BrokenPromise   https://t.co/ttigAKliTL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Literally laughed out loud reading about this "fireside chat" idea, simply imagining it:  A reading (not a transcript) which has missing pieces recited by a man who reflexively lies and adds fictionalized details to every speech, live on national television...  #UkraineScandal<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>First time in my life we had snow all day on Halloween. Sitting here waiting for the little ghouls and goblins (and princesses and superheroes), but with temps below freezing and winds up to 30 mph, we haven't seen any kids yet. #halloween2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every time I hear Trump say, "I did nothing wrong," I hear echoes of Rod Blagojevich, former governor of IL, who said the exact same thing.  Blagojevich held a Senate seat until he could get something of value for it. He was convicted; he's currently in prison.  #Corruption<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump cannot claim he's "bringing the troops home", nor that he's getting us out of "endless wars".  He needed an excuse, made one up, and let Erdogan do as he pleased, betraying our allies and, oh yeah, "securing the oil". #Syria #hypocrisy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds like the quid pro quo Trump engaged in with #Ukraine:  Withholding funds (bribes) to get what he wants.  The thing is -- Senators are jurors in Trump's trial. If that's not #Corrupt influence over justice, I don't know what to call it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Republicans are fond of saying "Elections have consequences".  Well, in 2018, an election gave Democrats the House. That election gave the majority the right to hold an #ImpeachmentInquiry.   Elections do have consequences, granting Constitutional powers.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>On the vote to hold an open and public investigation to follow the facts and find the truth:  To quote a famous film, #Republicans "can't handle the truth".  So they voted against having an investigation to find out whether wrongdoing occurred. Sickening. #ImpeachmentInquiry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree. This vote was for an open and public #ImpeachmentInquiry, something the GOP claimed to want.  It's shameful that #Republicans cannot even bring themselves to seek facts or truth.   Shocking, actually.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Senators take Trump's money, the exchange could be considered #bribery for their votes--the same kind of exchange Trump's accused of in the #Ukraine scandal: A quid pro quo.  Who would want that characterization of their conduct in an #impeachment proceeding?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Q this #ImpeachmentInquiry proceeding puts to the American people:  "Do we want a President who builds walls around the country but won't build a wall around our elections?"  --Jon Meacham, Presidential historian on @MSNBC this morning  Note to Mitch @senatemajldr McConnell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pelosi's speech to the House shows why an #ImpeachmentInquiry is necessary, emphasizing what's at stake--democracy itself.  I strongly support the continuation of this investigation to find the facts and the truth of whether Trump has abused his power &amp; corrupted his office.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Trump loves to brag about the economy during his tenure.  This article shows that it's not what he represents. Like all things he brags about, on this, too, he exaggerates or lies.

If, in his official capacity, the President acts for his personal interests only, it is an abuse of power, potentially impeachable.  That's why the #UkraineScandal became a scandal.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes, sir, yes, it does.  #ImpeachmentInquiry   https://t.co/4HZdTewKm1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lying on the transcript, by omission, just makes you wonder what else they're leaving out--from any official documentation, whether in the WH or elsewhere in this administration.  We don't know what we don't know.  Trump or his minions cannot use the word 'transparency'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching the #WorldSeries even though we have no team in it.   Hoping the #Nationals can take this game so we'll have one more to watch. That's the kind of Series we love--the full seven games.  Just true #BaseBall fans here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would think that this would be illegal since whistleblower identity protection is part of the law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Such short-term thinking got the US into recessions for decades. No need to roll back those protections.  Considering this administration's tax cuts for the wealthy that increased the national debt and deficit spending, Mnuchin shouldn't be tinkering w/the US economy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is despicable that anyone is questioning Vindman's (an active-duty Army officer) loyalty to the United States.  If this is the #Republicans' go-to defense going forward, their craven efforts will only earn them the disapprobation they deserve.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is like saying, "Well, the criminal said he didn't do it and a guy who depended on his goodwill corroborated it...so let's not look for other witnesses or facts."  We wouldn't accept that defense if we were watching a police procedural on TV.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brutal thread on #Republican cowardice when presented with actual evidence of wrongdoing.  This is the party of Trump in a nutshell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Immigrants have contributed far more to the US than we can ever measure. (See below)  Disgusted that #Republicans are smearing the reputation  of a witness to the #ImpeachmentInquiry who is active duty military w/a Purple Heart. Feeble, failing, unworthy, attempt at defense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnWDean When former Gov. Blagojevich was impeached and removed from office in IL, he was also banned from ever running from political office again. He was then indicted, convicted, and jailed for his crimes.  Disqualification definitely be necessary should Trump be impeached and removed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Evidence continues to mount that Trump offered Ukraine (Congressionally-appropriated) foreign aid in exchange for a sham investigation into his political rival.  This testimony will be a witness' account.  #ImpeachmentInquiry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For people who labeled others as '#snowflakes', this policing of public civility shows partisan sensitivity.  We'll return to #civility when an international crime syndicate is no longer running the people's government &amp; our President is no longer licking the boots of tyrants.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Subtweet from the grave...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I can understand why the president doesn't want these witnesses to come forward. What I find harder to understand is why the Republican members of this body in this House don't want these witnesses to come forward. Where is there duty to this institution?" #ImpeachmentInquiry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hard to swallow: "Let's respect the man who... -regularly commits crimes on an international scale using the full force and power of his office" -violates his oath of office daily." -disrespects the other branches of government." -respects no one but himself."  Hard pass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not exactly fear. Ordinary people don't give him what his pathology requires.  Trump's protective bubble maintains his grandiose fantasy, in which he *must* believe he's universally loved and admired. Reality disturbs that fictional world, creating #narcissistic injury.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For those complaining about Trump's reception at last night's World Series game, and saying we need "to respect our President":  Johnson was often greeted with this chant--  "Hey hey LBJ, How many kids did you kill today?"  Dissent is American. Disapproval of a President too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@ddale8 once again shows how lies, exaggeration, and deception are part of this Presidency--repeatedly and relentlessly.  Why does anyone believes him on any topic or at any time? Trump's word is worthless. #LiarInChief  https://t.co/C5pJSUDIt9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These statements debase Trump, the Presidency, and the country. Trump actually lied--and fictionalized--what happened. We know he lies; we know he embellishes; we know he self-congratulates.  To treat a mission in #Syria as if it had been some sporting event: Shameful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Utterly irresponsible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Joint operation. Important to recognize and thank our Kurdish allies who were significant partners in the effort, yet betrayed.  Trump failed, in his focus on others first. The man always turns a Presidential moment into a disgraceful display of his own incompetence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After that speech, this quote is even more absurd. Trump chose to thank Russia before those who contributed to this victory from our own country. He treated the lives lost in the fight like refuse. Major boost? Hardly. He‚Äôs humiliated himself again, and the US as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Trump‚Äôs family can benefit from his Presidency but it‚Äôs #Corruption when others‚Äô family members benefit from their high offices?   Nope...this is unethical and #corrupt too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is hilarious.  It would never occur to me to tweet my complaints ab. my iPhone to Tim Cook (aka Tim Apple), even if I were President of the United States. But this guy...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>As I watch former Pres. Barack Obama eulogizing Rep. Cummings, I'm remembering when we had a President who knew how to console a nation and lift us all up by recalling the values and virtues Cummings stood for and that our nation cherishes. #ElijahCummingsfuneral<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"#Impeachment is explicitly described in the Constitution as the way to remove a president who has committed 'high crimes and misdemeanors.'  ...you can‚Äôt get much more within the bounds of legality than an explicit power outlined in the Constitution."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't buy any #Republicans' complaints ab. "unfairness" to Trump.  -&gt;Almost all defendants say they're innocent.&lt;-  Yet we heard Trump ask for re-election help on TV.  We read the phone call summary w/Zelensky. We read Taylor's testimony.  It's not unfair to be held accountable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Republicans can't deny that Trump: -asked 2 foreign nations to help his re-election campaign (on TV!) -withheld aid to Ukraine, so that it would -perform a sham investigation into his political rival -and force its Pres. to announce it on TV  So GOP complains ab. accountability!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why I could not turn on our TV this morning: Elijah Cummings' funeral. Rep. Cummings, you deserve all the praise. Your life still inspires. Rest in peace, sir.  [And, just hearing Clinton praise Elijah Cummings...  Just hearing her speak here... Tears...]<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, if they discredit the Russia investigation, Trump can lift sanctions on Russia, something Putin wants badly.   Q: Why is Trump giving Putin everything he wants? #TrumpRussia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good point. And...  The purpose of today‚Äôs announcement is to  -instill fear at DOJ -incite negative speculation ab. DOJ -arouse suspicion ab. people -gain media attention  -in order to distract from the real substantive allegations against Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tired of #Republicans arguing that the #ImpeachmentInquiry isn't transparent.

<|startoftext|>Why the argument is an absurdity, and those who have a sweeping view of #PresidentialPower (like AG Barr, the OLC memo, and a few SCOTUS justices) have little imagination:  No one (not even a President) should be #AboveTheLaw.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Trump doesn't believe conspiracy to commit illegal acts is criminal, nor does he think statutes apply to him.

<|startoftext|>How's representative democracy going?  House #Republicans are so scared of having the facts ab. the #UkraineScandal emerge that they: -stormed a secure facility, with banned electronics -squatted there w/pizza -prevented witnesses from testifying  Truth terrifies them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump's spreading his desperation to his loyal House lieutenants. Starting to look like #Republicans' willingness to please Trump will lead to tactics unworthy of elected officials. If he's among them, contact your rep. Today's #SCIFStunt is just the beginning. #StopTheMadness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump's attorneys were in court today seriously arguing that the President is above the law. He could (hypothetically) even commit murder and not be investigated or held accountable.  In front of a judge.  Jaw drop. Speechless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Definitely no respect for the process, but isn't entering a SCIF w/electronics and taking photos illegal also?  Shouldn't they face legal proceedings for their actions?   https://t.co/6IZphGQ7jS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Republicans have repeatedly revealed that they respect neither the Constitution nor the #RuleOfLaw.  The United States government cannot be trusted in their hands.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Horrifying speech by Trump--sounded just like him, so he must have written it himself.  Victory? Over what and for what? The US betrayed and abandoned its allies. Then lifted sanctions on Turkey after its invasion of a sovereign country and committed war crimes.  Shameful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More bad news for Trump and #Republicans.

<|startoftext|>STUNT. They're trying to literally show Trump that they're doing **something** to "fight" impeachment.  Since this #ImpeachmentInquiry is following the exact same process as all others in my lifetime, it's hard to have sympathy for #Republicans' feeble objections.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And some wished Nixon had been jailed, not pardoned. So what? Personal anecdotal "evidence" proves nothing.  Principles --such as, for ex., bribery is a criminal abuse of power-- should guide what we choose to do.  The US values the #RuleofLaw above all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very concerning to authorize military force on US soil to enforce immigration policy.  The Posse Comitatus Act expressly forbids the federal government from using military personnel to enforce domestic policies within the United States. #Immigration   https://t.co/xpDFDMuogh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously? There are wealthy people standing by, waiting to see what happens among Democrats, before they decide if they'll run for President?

<|startoftext|>Since when is "It's not a crime" the #standard for a President's conduct?  Once we expected only the highest standards--of conduct, of rhetoric, of values--for our President.

<|startoftext|>It's been a year of challenges. Feeling overwhelming #gratitude today for so many in my life.  Have no team in the #WorldSeries but it's always awe-inspiring to watch the best.  And I'm very grateful for #whistleblowers and career public servants, who give me hope.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Another quote from the article above:  "But conservatives are not America‚Äôs oppressed, and Donald Trump is not a victim. An impeachment inquiry is not a lynching."  Again: Conservatives are NOT America's oppressed, and Trump is NOT a victim. He's being held accountable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"For years, conservatives have portrayed themselves as America‚Äôs most oppressed minority, suffering through an endless series of attacks and indignities with only their righteousness to protect them... That sense of victimhood has become central to conservative identity..." Yep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Learned early that meticulous note-taking was a necessity for self-preservation in business consultancy.

<|startoftext|>This @HillaryClinton thread is worth reading, b/c correcting the record is critical today--in a time when half-truths masquerade as gospel.  Let's try to get it right. Let's do our best to be honest. Let's search out truth and admit errors.  Let's reclaim integrity.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's getting more difficult for #Republicans to defend a President who: -withholds foreign aid appropriated by Congress to extort a foreign nation to illegally investigate his political rival -compares a Constitutional process w/#lynching  So they berate the investigators.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Learned this adage from a politician I once worked for: "During mudslinging, never let mud dry."  Remaining quiet on a claim lends credence to its assertion, even when false. Responding in kind is also fraught.   Responding is necessary. HOW it's done--with high values--matters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How degraded respect for #expertise truly is:  I've been reading actual tweets by people...  -"informing" expert historians about lynching -"helping" foreign policy experts understand Syria -"instructing" ob/gyns about women's bodies  SMDH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Republicans, rebuked by Trump for not "fighting hard enough" for him against impeachment, are now echoing Trump's outrageous claim that impeachment is somehow just like lynching.   This desperate claim by Republicans boggles the mind.   Actual #Lynching:  https://t.co/C1FPr6cii8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Using a remedy, enshrined in the Constitution, to investigate whether a President committed bribery, high crimes, or misdemeanors is now associated with a mob action?

<|startoftext|>@nytopinion @nytimes Nevertheless, It's journalistic malpractice to compare Clinton's use of a hardened private email server w/the Trump administration's use of private iPhones, apps like WhatsApp, Gmail, etc.  And that was not reflected whatsoever in this ill-conceived op-ed.  https://t.co/Y8do01YVTh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytopinion ...which are not under any sort of government control or surveillance.  That's a national security threat @nytimes has failed to investigate (probably because the scandals of the Trump administration already require so much manpower).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytopinion Clinton used a hardened server.  The various private email and communications channels used by the Trump administration are through unhardened devices, which Trump finds too complex. Instead, they are using publicly available apps and even public email servers...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@nytopinion decided to use "whataboutism" to compare and criticize the Trump administration for THEIR use of private email, comparing that to Clinton's server, thus creating a myth that all politicians are similarly #corrupt.

<|startoftext|>Let this thread by an historian explain further: #impeachment   https://t.co/FvDbnUvV7e<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't believe it needs to be said. 1) Impeachment is the Constitutional remedy for the House to recommend the removal of a President; it's like an indictment, not a trial. Senate tries and convicts. 2) Impeachment is NOT lynching. 3) Trump is a disgrace for making the comparison.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Continues to confuse me too.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Consider: "there's no real way to check".  We've never had a President break the law like this, so there's no law that provides oversight on such "donations".   He should have been forced to divest prior to taking office. The next President must be. #EmolumentsClause<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Quick reminder: The US Constitution (Sec. II, Art. 4) gives Congress the authority to remove a President by impeachment.  Importantly, therefore:  -&gt; Impeachment is not illegal &lt;- despite the claims of some.  Nor is it a coup d'√©tat.  https://t.co/XBJZhe6kXq<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>One of the many reasons Americans conclude that #Republicans are mere #partisans and don't care about #principles and #ethics.  They used to decry "situational ethics". Now they define them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't confuse this.  Trump is being investigated b/c he's possibly engaged in conduct that's unethical or even illegal. That's why many don't like him.  Mulvaney suggested the reverse--that they don't like him, so he's being investigated. THAT is willfully blind paranoia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can we believe even on this basis that Trump is faithfully executing his oath of office?  Fundamental aspects for a major event‚Äîsecurity for world leaders‚Äîoverlooked or ignored in order to fulfill an unethical personal agenda and hold the G7 at one of his resorts.   Failing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What kind of ‚Äúnegotiated agreement‚Äù gives one side everything it wants and the other side gets one thing (the so-called cease fire) which is violated within hours?  That‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúart of the deal‚Äù.  Simply humiliating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While Trump rails about Biden‚Äôs son, his own daughter is doing business with China -&gt; from the White House&lt;-.   Talk about profiting from the Presidency: Conflicts of interest define him and his family. (Also hypocrisy.)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sadly, we must now codify into law what was taken as a given--ethical conduct by a President.  We must protect the Presidency from corruption. Trump's using the Executive branch as if he's a mafia don and betraying American values at home and abroad. #ReformThePresidency<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here is a clip from Mulvaney's news conference in which he admits that Trump committed an impeachable offense while "defending" the administration's actions.   https://t.co/3VMuLNv6mh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly right.  Trump wanted leverage his Ukraine operation to eventually absolve Russia of the 2016 election interference so that he could lift sanctions.  It's is a much bigger #conspiracy than Ukraine alone.  As Pelosi said, "All roads lead to Putin."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After Trump's gone, enact legislation to -require Presidents to divest their assets with penalties, such as being unable to take office -require candidates for President to release their taxes -fine and/or disqualify candidates who do not release their taxes #EmolumentsClause<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Trump has lied so many times over the course of his first campaign and his past nearly three years in office that the only words he says that anyone can believe are"I" and "Trump".  This is frankly frightening, considering that he has created a crisis in #Syria. #TrumpLiesMatter<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>There's no due process during an investigation, which is what an impeachment inquiry is. After impeachment by the House, kind of like indictment, the Senate tries him on those charges.

<|startoftext|>What Trump did regarding Turkey, Syria, and the Kurds was a "catastrophic, moral, military blunder" according to  @EvelynNFarkas, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia/Ukraine/Eurasia, on @MSNBC's #AMJoy. Her analysis was informative, relevant, and pointed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even I know his claim is lame.  Rudy has no official government position. Thus he's acting as a "shadow diplomat" at Trump's or Pompeo's direction. Whether he discussed his deals w/people at State doesn't make it official US diplomacy. He was working outside normal channels.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Embattled President's public relations:  Let's recycle a Nixon defense! We'll just say "they're trying to undo the 2016 election"!  [Didn't work for Tricky Dick. Not gonna work for Don the Con.]<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fair to say that a huge percentage of Americans don't understand why @SpeakerPelosi, @RepAdamSchiff, @RepJerryNadler, and @RepCummings do not use the powers they have to compel testimony.  Failing to do so signals impunity. Hardly the message to send. #ImpeachmentInquiry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump tries to sabotage #Medicare. There, that's a better summary.  Costs are going up, for the premiums and for prescription drugs...and some procedures.  Fleecing people on fixed incomes is hardly humane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Likely to be &gt;just one instance&lt; of Trump violating his oath of office.  It's what we don't know about how he's been conducting himself during his Presidency that worries me.  And those who have been protecting him have also been violating their oaths. #impeachment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AND: Impeachment is definitely a legitimate power of Congress.  Constitution: "The House of Representatives shall choose their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment."  President approving of how his #impeachment should proceed is not mentioned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IOW, to state the obvious, again:  If Trump leaves office thru the #impeachment process or resignation, it does not UNDO the 2016 election, as Trump keeps trying to assert.  [Most Americans know this, but we have to say it for the benefit of the few.]<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should the President be impeached, the Senate would have to evaluate the charges and vote as to whether he should be removed.  Should the Senate vote to remove (or the President resign), the VP becomes the next President.  That's how we got Pres. Ford after Nixon's resignation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just to state the obvious:  #Impeachment is a Constitutional remedy to begin a process of determining whether a federal government's high officers (such as the President) should be removed due to wrongdoing on the part of that officer.  It is NOT an attempt to undo an election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump tantrum.  Constitution: "The House of Representatives shall choose their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment."  Note that it does NOT say that the President can direct his own #impeachment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump's failed to pay his bills in other cities before. He's asking cities, and their citizens, to pay his bills.  'Grifters Not Welcome' is a good policy.  Good for #Minneapolis.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When Trump blocks testimony to Congress by his officials, he's blocking the American people from finding out what  government is doing.

<|startoftext|>Have to ask:  Why is Trump giving Putin everything he wants?  Literally, what is the motivation? Is there something hidden which Trump doesn't want known? Is money an object?  Americans need to understand why Trump sides w/dictators against US interests.  #ImpeachmentInquiry<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Everything we held up as emblematic of what's wrong in the world...Trump has invited into the United States.  Never thought I'd see something like this. Thoroughly disheartening.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Trump can't refute the facts: He asked a foreign country to get "dirt" on a political rival in exchange for US foreign aid. That's illegal.  So he attacks investigators.

<|startoftext|>@MMcHarry Don't want to hear candidates say 'run government like a business' again.  Government has different motives and goals than any business. Its structure differs.

Still disturbing   https://t.co/lDFnjf6ob3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disturbing. Trump's truly aggrieved. It's all about him. Now he's out for vengeance.  Obama's admin. investigated foreign interference in the 2016 election. Trump campaign was investigated; some officials were indicted and convicted, along w/Russians, proving it was necessary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just what I was thinking...and wondering how many others, at lower levels, were involved but may not have known what the real end game was supposed to be--extort a foreign country using foreign aid, for the political advantage of the President.  https://t.co/ImvQHEaJYw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump had &gt;how many people&lt; working Zelensky?  Kind of a full court press on the neophyte Ukrainian President. Trump must have *needed* that concocted Biden smear pretty badly.  GOP: If you can't be assured of winning, cheat to increase your chances. Only this was far worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, I read this article last night (during a period of insomnia) and it kept me awake.  The privileged and entitled political  w/o diplomatic experience and deep knowledge don't belong in the foreign service just b/c they gave money to a campaign. They endanger to our country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thread on Trump shrinking the #NSC, but I think these are the salient points, below.  Trump's terrified of more leaks. He must have a great deal to hide.  And, sadly for the country, career professionals are concerned about their futures and thus won't work for him anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allinwithchris @MSNBC @mashagessen Again, another clip of tonight's great @allinwithchris. #Watergate #Impeachment    https://t.co/NnZ6T6cGXV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allinwithchris @MSNBC Hayes hosted 3 people involved w/Watergate discussing #Impeachment.  @mashagessen was also Chris Hayes' guest tonight.  Gessen quote: Autocrats "actually believe that the entire world is #Corrupt. So then everything else loses meaning." ...Everything becomes ab. power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allinwithchris Here's a clip from tonight's @allinwithchris in which he's explaining the #Ukraine texts that the House posted last night.  I imagine @MSNBC will post the entire segment at a later time.   https://t.co/xqPK6LfiqE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On @allinwithchris, Hayes is describing what happened over the past week with a live audience.  He's showing the texts among the #Ukraine envoy and others regarding Trump's demand of a foreign country...and the audience gets it immediately. They're not confused whatsoever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pre-judging articles of impeachment, which he has yet to see, read, or understand, would be a subversion of our democratic processes under the Constitution and a betrayal of our republic.  Who does he think he is? A king-maker?  To fund-raise on such betrayals is beyond the pale.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Voters should know that Sen. Sanders had a heart attack ("myocardial infarction"). A heart attack definitely means a taking a break from ordinary activities, for weeks or months. (I'm no MD, but my dad had 3 heart attacks.)  Wishing #BernieSanders a complete recovery.  https://t.co/11Gqc9Q5vp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are Trump &amp; allies following a Russian playbook that ousted others in #Ukraine?  How were two Soviet-born businessmen and political operatives, mentioned in the #WhistleblowerComplaint, involved?  Inquiring minds want to know. #Corruption   https://t.co/9d9S3pllEv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thread, along with this story:  Poll: Majority of GOP voters now say Supreme Court should not revisit Roe v. Wade  https://t.co/UCChMIFTRS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is #Corrupt to &gt;invent&lt; scandals to discredit, attack, or harass political opponents or past political "enemies".  If Trump wants to fight #Corruption, he should first stop lying and promoting conspiracy theories about opponents in order to adversely influence voters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is #Corrupt to use US law enforcement to harass, attack, or otherwise discredit political opponents or "enemies".  Trump is using AG Barr and the DOJ to do it, in public, and recruiting foreign nations for help in their efforts.  #Corruption<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dodge, divert, deflect, deceive...define Donald.  He knows he hasn't asked, b/c #Corruption" is a mask over what's really being done--asking for foreign assistance to get "dirt" on a political rival.  And we know from years of experience that Trump lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Important points.  https://t.co/QRt9NM8ArZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He does care ab. a few things:  -Saving himself from prosecution  -Enriching himself -Retaining power at any cost  Otherwise, sure, that's true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump saying he has a duty to end corruption is like the abuser who tells you it's your fault he's hitting you...and if you just did what he wanted, you wouldn't be bloodied.  Trump accuses others of the crimes he's guilty of.  Gaslighting America is part of his #corruption.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which is both -#Corruption -A violation of his oath of office  Every day Trump is in office, he's violating -the Constitution -his oath of office<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump knows it's illegal to solicit foreign help in his re-election campaign. He just doesn't want to be bound by the law.  Here's the chair of the Federal Election Commission, who retweeted this yesterday:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump believes, or wants to believe, that this wild conspiracy theory is actually true.   It's part of an effort to try to exonerate Russia from its role, that 17 intelligence agencies affirmed, in interfering in the 2016 election.   #ElectionInterference  https://t.co/OFzEYfXBpS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The DOJ is investigating Trump's political rival?  Based on a debunked conspiracy theory?  The US has really gone off the rails...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is CORRUPT to use the office of the Presidency and the full weight and power of the United States to ask for political favors and election interference from foreign nations.   And it is also ILLEGAL. #Corruption<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Short thread.  Rep. Pascrell has referred AG Barr for professional disciplinary action.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Donald "Absolute Right" Trump lives in his own Fantasy Kingdom (aka Trumplandia), as its monarch.  #IHaveAnAbsoluteRight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching the Braves - Cardinals game...and the 9th inning was tense.   Cardinals prevailed 7-6.  #NLDS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let Chuck Todd explain the gravity of our current situation:  https://t.co/XpVF6prrzQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clearly:   Asking a foreign country to interfere in our elections undermines our ability as citizens to determine the outcome of our elections.   It also undermines a central idea of America--that we are a country by, for, and of the people.  Not hard to understand. #Corruption<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Trump family needs to tread lightly on the allegations of #Corruption within a family currently running the government.  Loans to Trump son-in-law and WH advisor Jared Kushner could raise some questions of conflicts of interest or #Corruption.  https://t.co/YilFWryXZz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How about all the Chinese trademarks Ivanka's been granted? During Trump's trade talks?  And now Trump's asked China to investigate his political rival during trade talks? #ElectionInterference #Bribery   https://t.co/YPvtrkyRtY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As long as we're talking about Presidents and Vice-Presidents profiting off their offices, let's ask how much Trump and Pence -- and their families -- are profiting.  Ex: Trump just recently profited off Pence's visit to his resort in Ireland...and more.  https://t.co/Mden9EsSTU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This story is wild.   One thing that sticks out: Trump implies that American officials--and their families--can be *bought* by implying that it happened w/Biden's son.   That kind of #Corruption has long been illegal in the US.  Wondering if Trump family's been bought, tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We've been telling you: Trump wants to privatize #Medicare and reduce #SocialSecurity.  An Executive Order claims to "protect Medicare" but would actually raise prices and potentially reduce services, or privatize them.  Time to write to your reps, again.   https://t.co/AjHZpJn2Hc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AARPadvocates Thank you, @TopherSpiro.  Thread:  https://t.co/AjHZpJn2Hc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can anyone explain--in plain English--how this Executive Order will change #Medicare and #MedicareAdvantage plans? It gives timelines for changes but I don't read enough specificity on those changes.   Help, please, @AARPadvocates.   https://t.co/3nn2YzWYVg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This segment of @DeadlineWH gives expert analysis on the #UkraineScandal, including guest commentary from @PhilipRucker, @nickconfessore, Ambassador @McFaul, and Former Undersecretary of State Stengel.  Excellent hosting by @NicolleDWallace as usual.  https://t.co/0n1yrCPbWK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Dictatorship watch:   Create state-run media to promote the Dear Leader. Just like North Korea!  [A free press is enshrined in the Constitution, so that the people know what their government is doing. State-run media is designed to hide it.]<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No matter what happens, Trump will *never* let this go.  He's a victim and martyr in his own mind. He'll whine and complain for the rest of his life. And he'll try to enact vengeance on his perceived enemies.  You can bank on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSNBC Seriously? Too stupid to be next in line for President also, then?  "He is floating the absurd defense that, while he did participate in Trump‚Äôs plan to extort Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden, he was completely ignorant of what he was doing." #Ukraine  https://t.co/DiQahNAeu6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Republicans think Americans will forget what they've done in the past.  They agreed w/Biden on #Ukraine. They just don't want you to know ab. that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump doing Putin's bidding w/Ukraine while, at the same time, demanding neophyte Zelensky's help with his re-election (+ interference in our election sovereignty).  A very sad day for US foreign relations. An impeachable offense by an American President. #UkraineScandal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pence, at center of Trump Ukraine scheme, scrambles for cover  https://t.co/dXMYyPdwVV via @msnbc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HouseGOP Here's where @HouseGOP stands, apparently, even after Trump publicly admitted to bribing foreign countries:   @GOPLeader McCarthy demands that the #ImpeachmentInquiry be suspended, claiming procedural grounds, a distraction not a rational justification.  https://t.co/v77XLO7QYl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>VERY important.  The 2020 elections determine who gets to redistrict the states.  Support your local Democrats. Start now. #gerrymandering<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In case you didn't think Trump was trying to coerce China into investigating his political rival, here's what he said before he demanded that investigation:  https://t.co/uJhrIAS5ZC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Article plus thread.  No one, not even the President, is above the law.  #Impeachment #ImpeachmentInquiry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"...bribery was understood as an officeholder‚Äôs abuse of the power of an office to obtain a private benefit, rather than for the public interest. This definition not only encompasses Trump‚Äôs conduct‚Äîit practically defines it."  #Bribery #Impeachment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So a mob boss who says, "Joey Bag'o'Donuts better not talk to those coppers"...trailing off... wouldn't be intimidation and have corrupt intent?  C'mon. Even the most ordinary citizen knows the meaning of a statement like that, coming from someone with the power to act on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Republicans must choose: US sovereignty or Trumpism  Trump's publicly demanding foreign adversaries interfere in our sovereign elections or they won't get foreign aid or trade deals. Definite quid pro quo. Simple. Corrupt.   So tell us: Where do you stand, @HouseGOP?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Regarding Trump's requests to Ukraine &amp; China to investigate his political rival (on TV today):  "We have a rolling abuse of power," said Jon Meacham, Presidential historian, on @MSNBC just now. "There is a pattern here."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any complaints about family members profiting off the Presidency (or Vice-Presidency) have to lead back to Trump's family and the Trump Organization, since Trump was elected.  Corruption + hypocrisy.  #Nepotism #Emoluments #Corruption #Hypocrisy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here is Trump saying these things outside the White House this morning:   https://t.co/EgZa2JAPqN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The boldness of this illegal conduct is stunning.  Trump's asking for quid pro quo from China right out in the open. This is a type of extortion or bribery AGAIN.  He's self-impeaching. #ImpeachmentInquiry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Story ab. Schiff staff having heard ab. the #Whistleblower is being blown out of proportion by the right.  Remember...they can't attack on the facts...so they try to discredit messengers and investigators.   Don't buy in.  https://t.co/KnMykNcDN2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Important.  Don‚Äôt let the deluge overwhelm you.  Stay focused.  Read summaries.  Stay calm.  Have a life away from the madness. And...  ‚ÄúBe as courageous as you can.‚Äù ‚ÄîTimothy Snyder, ‚ÄúOn Tyranny‚Äù<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's precisely what concerns me--what we don't know about what's behind all the nefarious activities recently revealed.  Ex: Giuliani consulted w/Manafort lawyers ab. Ukraine. What *don't* we know?  I worry ab. all of the #lies #deceit #deception #diversion #distraction<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's happening among Trump, his advisors, &amp; staff:  They can't deny what Trump admitted--He used foreign aid to Ukraine to demand a personal and political favor, which amounts to foreign interference in a US election.  So they attack messengers &amp; investigators. #UkraineScandal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. Hillary Clinton is informing the public on how leader-to-leader calls work, who's informed, etc.  Very helpful to hear her viewpoint as a former Secretary of State.  #Maddow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boy who cried 'wolf' meets Emperor w/o clothes.  "...a former White House official said, 'You can't go around screaming 'fake news' and 'witch hunt' when you yourself put the evidence out there. It doesn't work that way.' "   https://t.co/N7FzcA5RJL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's an important point. However...  Pence can't claim ignorance. He was VP and did some dirty deeds in furtherance of Trump's illegal ask of a foreign leader to interfere in a US election.  Can't pretend he wasn't an accessory to the crime. #UkraineScandal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely absurd.  It's an attempt to deflect attention away from the President's illegal conduct: He asked a foreign country to "get dirt" on a political rival while withholding US foreign aid as leverage.  Whatever a whistleblower did to bring that conduct to light was heroic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The rich and powerful can do whatever they wish.  For everyone else, there are rules and laws.  Twitter's become a plutocratic oligarchy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because yesterday the DOJ said it could not assure Judge Amy Berman Jackson that the WH would &gt;voluntarily&lt; retain all records. Judge Jackson told the lawyers that they had until today to affirm it or she would have to order it.  https://t.co/7MuGfkugcu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #WhistleblowerComplaint also alleged that a "word for word" transcript existed.  If there's another "transcript", Congressional committees may wish to ask for copies, so that they can evaluate its contents as part of the #ImpeachmentInquiry.  https://t.co/fBkECk1aBr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another #WhistleblowerComplaint that may have been "mishandled".  Another possible Congressional investigation about the Trump administration and its laxity toward the rule of law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it possible that this packet of conspiracy theories, which was sent (in Trump-branded folders!) to the Secretary of State, is Pompeo's excuse for following up on some of the implausible things Trump wants to believe are true? In other words, Pompeo's CYA?  https://t.co/6WvbcjmwPU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This will hurt industries already suffering from #TrumpTariffs and trade policies, and in the end hurt the economy and the American people.   Trump doesn't know what he's doing.  Read how farmers were already being hurt.  https://t.co/Em1gWejd4z<|endoftext|>
