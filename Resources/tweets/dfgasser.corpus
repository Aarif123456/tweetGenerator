<|startoftext|>@JoseADelgadoEND @HuffPostPol I live in Puerto Rico and her interests are my interest. But I’m tired of one-issue voters. Life is more complicated. I think people need to look at the bigger picture, and always consider the ramifications of their action (or inaction ). If I could, I’d vote for Ossoff. Simple.<|endoftext|>
