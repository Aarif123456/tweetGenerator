<|startoftext|>Instead of taking care of the entire country, this man has spent more time grooming his cult followers before the election &amp; herding them after to bring in more donations for himself and his debt. &amp; still after all his failed attempts he continues. I’m disgusted #ByeDon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn’t that the F’in truth!!  #ByeDonnie stop worrying about how much you lost and start worrying about the people of America!  #StimulusNow my PUA unemployment is almost done can’t find a job in my field and not sure what our family will do after next week<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is exactly the point...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I didnt vote for @GovLarryHogan during his last election. But the way he handled the pandemic in #Maryland ... you better F’in bet I will vote for him during his next. I’m a dem, &amp;will vote for this rep Gov who has taken care of his state &amp;shown #trump how he should have done it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovLarryHogan #IAmAMarylander &amp;I’m so #Thankful for @GovLarryHogan &amp;the effort he put into this virus before many other states.  #Trump You aren’t working for the people- only urself. U should have taken note of governors like #Hogan that work for his people!! #ByeDon #Concede #MarylandStrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews I am a Marylander sir... &amp;I believe @GovLarryHogan has done an amazing job for MD. He believes in science &amp;wants to protect &amp;thinks about the PEOPLE in his state-sad to say- unlike others in office... he brought over tests when there were none. #ByeDon #Maryland #TransitionNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nichole05829408 @JeffreeStar I cant tell you why you didn’t want people wearing masks before...I want people to wear masks now to protect themselves &amp;the people closest to them. It’s a new virus, spreading in the air thru droplets. Maybe look up info or talk to your doctor so you understand what’s happening<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffreeStar I’m a severe asthmatic and have anxiety  and THATS WHY I WEAR ONE!!   As people at high risk we should be wearing one!!  Ugh ridiculous.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AOC I’m so angry too. Feeling really scared and lost.  #StimulusNow #Unemployment we’re doing everything we can during a pandemic and it doesn’t feel like enough to support our small family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC I’m not tolerating it!  what can we do??   They work for us right?  Where are they?? My UI is ending, school loans are going to start &amp; I’m a severe asthmatic w/ a 2 year old. Thank God my husband is still working but things are tight They don’t know who I am &amp;don’t seem to care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RexChapman We all need to remember this and try to be more like these two girls. #KindnessMatters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC I got my BFA in interior design in 2018. Lost my job in March bc of #COVID &amp; local design jobs are nonexistent now. Im out of UI in Dec and starting my fed loans back in Jan. Thaxfully my husband works but with our little one&amp; credit debt I don’t know what we’re going to do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s ok that Thanksgiving will look and feel different this year. It IS different this year. Let’s be thankful for those in our house and protect those that we can’t be with this year.... &amp; thankful that @JoeBiden is our #PresidentElectJoe  #ByeDon #WearADamnMask #BidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewYang I lost my job due to Covid &amp; thankfully have UI &amp;my fed. loans paused the last few months... but UI is ending EOY &amp;my Fed. Loans will start again in Jan! &amp; my private loans r on a temp lower % rate which will be ending next year as well. I don’t know what we’re going to do. 😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Twitter #DefundTrump #deleteTrump  he’s dangerous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Completely irresponsible... worrying about himself instead of the Americans that he’s supposed to work for.  He should be worried about helping w/covid &amp;setting up the next president to get HIS job done. Have some dignity #donnie #ConcedeNowTrump #PresidentElectJoe #ByeDon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DevonESawa He’s completely irresponsible...  he’s worried about himself instead of the millions of Americans that he’s supposed to work for.  He should be worried about helping us thru covid and setting up the next president to get HIS job done. Have some dignity #donnie #ConcedeNowTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get it yet @realDonaldTrump   ??#ConcedeNowTrump #ByeByeTrump #PresidentElectJoe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s going to be a long couple months till @JoeBiden gets into the White House. #donnie just needs to get a clue and get out!  #BidenHarrisTransition #ConcedeNowTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am so baffled that @realDonaldTrump is doing everything in his ‘power’ to keep himself in power instead of doing what should be done for the American people...during a pandemic. I shouldn’t be surprised, but I am. #WTF #GETOUTOFOURHOUSE  #ConcedeTrump #Overit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@andylassner Exactly... people say horrible things about his mental state, but that’s not it at all!!  He’s working thru a stutter sometimes. Sometimes we can see it. I admire him so much more knowing that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewYang My husband is still working to support our family thank God. I lost my job due to Covid and haven’t been able to find something in my field since. Thanking God for the bit of UI I’ve been getting. But it’s ending in Dec and I don’t know what we’re going to do. #Biden2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PaulyShore @ChrisCuomo is a bit more genuine to me.  Don is good but I dunno I can’t put my finger on him sometimes. Maybe he seems a little forced in conversation or when he’s reporting. Both intelligent men.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Wrong. Just completely wrong.  #ImVotingForBiden you keep putting the people in danger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeghanMcCain Girl those first few weeks are rough!!!   Nipple gel pads, and cream are the way to go!!  And some ice every once and a while. It’ll get better... once they call us over. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t be afraid of Covid if you have dozens of the top doctors by your side &amp; get immediate medical assistance. Be VERY afraid of Covid if you are anyone else. Be VERY fearful of it not for urself but for your family and those that have already passed #WhiteHouseVirus #voteBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DevonESawa Since my almost 2 year old was born I whisper in his ear every night ‘Can I keep you?’    Sounds creepier now that I’m typing it out. 🤷🏼‍♀️.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DevonESawa Feeling the same way. I hope he comes out of this with respect and FEAR of this disease- the worst thing would be him to have only mild symptoms and tell people it’s not that big of a deal. 👏🏼🤦🏼‍♀️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MeghanMcCain Yes girl. I love being a mom and feel so blessed that I am one of those that could get pregnant but HATE being pregnant. I was not one of those ‘oh this is the greatest part of my life’ pregnant ladies. And I think whoever says they love being pregnant is full of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeghanMcCain Went to a foot dr after my babe She gave me some braces while still breast feeding, the hormones keep ligaments loose. I thought my arches fell -not real- my feet are a bit bigger bc of the hormones but said after nursing things could get better, but may still be a little big<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DisneyStudios @Disney @disneyplus #Disney #Disneyland #WakandaForever<|endoftext|>
