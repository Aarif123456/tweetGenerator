<|startoftext|>That will work....😜<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you suggesting fair elections? We are going to have to clean up a lot more than voter rolls...money, media, meat puppets (the three #MMM ). In other words; the swamp!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If we lose the Senate, IMHO the Dems will screw things up so bad the Dems will be blown out of DC in 2022. They can't deliver and they won't be able to blame conservatives. Game over.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not to mention few will admit they #VoteRED2020RemoveEveryDemocrat !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They will be soundly defeated. It is all good. Just think of all the money the #BigTech and media oligarchy has spent on their false god, #sloppyjoebiden . It is a major redistribution of wealth that will churn the economy into action. #SilverLining<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Good point! Either he is full of #malarky or he is withholding the information to sway the election by continuing to bolster the Covid talking point and continue the panic until after the ballot. Either evil or a lie. Take your pick!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not one! I know people who are voting for him who didn't vote last time. Covid fear is real among the left and mail in voting is going to slew the results.

<|startoftext|>I have no idea of how @realDonaldTrump has the stamina to go and go and keep on going. His ethic is a beacon and a motivation to all of us. Forward, forward onward till we reach our goal for the health of this nation. The #ReElectTrump #win .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FullfillerT Yes, we have created enemies and made mistakes. That is an entirely separate and complex  subject. I do know some history, but it is not my expertise. Thanks for the tweets. C' ya<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Building factories in the timeframe needed was impractical. Most people don't realize the bind we were in. That is why we need a strong, nationalist leaning trade policy. It is about national security. Biden is a weakling. A Biden Presidency would present an existential threat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In a way...they already are. We are very dependant on medicines and certain commodities from Asia. Take for example melt blown fiber that is used in masks, among other things. China produces the vast majority of that material. Hence, we were forced to buy masks from them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it can be patched up if Trump wins. If he loses, I am a bit concerned about the global economic situation. We are very intertwined with the world economy an I think the leftist socialists will give it all away and China will become the world bully.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>America: Just watched @JoeBiden limp through a speech in #Philadelphia . I was literally in tears. He couldn't even make 15 minutes without stumbling over ideas, he made no sense. He did, however, wear his Eagle's jacket and reminisce about Grandpop's house and deceased friend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, @realDonaldTrump is right, with protective measures we are turning the corner. The last thing we need are shutdowns, shortages, and widespread panic. The elderly and compromised are more vulnerable to supply chain disruptions.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thinking about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, I saw an example just yesterday. They think @JoeBiden is the answer. Biden is a stealth fascist, anti LBGTQ+ person who will undermine your rights along with everyone else.

<|startoftext|>Yes...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bubbabobobfett @RBReich Again...cutting hours of existing employees does not necessarily mean a reduction in workforce.

<|startoftext|>@danigehm @supermajority Exactly how does an algorithm decide if something is a fact or logical? It is simply a program which is coded by a human being.

<|startoftext|>You just have to see this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, Lisa...and @JoeBiden will be unable to control her ambition and rage against #ConservativeWomen #Libertarian throughout the USA. The only way to stop her is to #VoteRedToSaveAmerica2020 #VoteRedToSaveAmerica vote now! #VoteEarly<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump must find a way to fix social media and the corrupt news and entertainment industries. There is no one better! Put an end to #megaCorporate #censorship and the muzzling of non check mark voices by big tech and big data #globalist #megalopolies 🛑<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I agree with the logic.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Absolutely! Not to mention the cost of electricity to charge it will be astronomical. Electric cars are for fools and the rich today.

<|startoftext|>@Jones17Charlene I think he had a list of topics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marmilin @ScottBaio Looks like people are catching on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chertex @ScottBaio Retweet even more, they will abandon the strategy😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's what they are looking for...metrics. Do some research on big data and network analysis with regard to embedded metadata. They find more and more ways to manipulate without letting you know directly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are not telling the whole story...I will leave it there. Twitter counts every click and touch. It is called metadata content.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottBaio @Mike_Beacham They are trying to throttle by needing to click twice. Just leave it blank. I suspect the algorithms may rank it down on trending lists etc. They have made many subtle changes that IT people notice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottBaio @Mike_Beacham Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill That's his plan? Testing is not a cure or a theraputic. Anyone over the age of 60 knows how to handle this virus. People who feel sick or may have been exposed need to stay away from the vulnerable. A plan would be to #freedelivery food at home to vulnerable seniors living alone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Patriotsrizing It's not a malfunction. It only happens to certain demographics if you feel the drift. Happened to me too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LarryKutcher @Necie_624 I won't say the A word...not now😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, that was a slip. @JoeBiden has lost my respect as a VP. I actually voted for him. I made a big mistake. 🥴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity You don't want to know what many of us call her?😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reminds me of a spoiled child...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LarryKutcher @Necie_624 Are you sure? It gives that message when there are a lot of replies...the alorithm may be pushing it lower in the list for other reasons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Patriotsrizing ♥️We love you 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How do you pay for it? By reducing everyones choices, benefits and taxing the 💩💩 out of everyone? Shame on you; throwing us under the #BlueBus 🚌🚍💊🤮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden How do you "shut down" this virus? Please Tweet the answer directly! Include links to your facts, Mr. Senator. @dbongino @IngrahamAngle @TuckerCarlson @sourpatchlyds @Timcast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They hopefully need to be verified...many states do that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are some technical forensic issues with further accessing the devices before handing them over. Even reading the device causes some loss of evidence continuity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ignorance in the radical left abounds...but they have the latest iphone model locked in! What we got when we spoiled our children!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have all seen individuals behave like this when they have no rational reasons for their feelings or beliefs. Like trapped animals trying to chew their legs off to get away. Unfortunately, they can't get away from themselves. How sad. I will pray for him🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What do you think his motive is? Preying on fear?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like #LiarInChief Obama on #OliarCare ? I lost my health because if his lies? Don't take a chance on #wafflingBiden or #WaffleCare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The facts: Direct from CDC website  https://t.co/BOH6hvy0A1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are flagging this tweet...WHY? Algorithms designed to generate click$$$.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, they would like a repeat of the energy embargo on the US. They would hold us hostage in a heartbeat!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden was BHS bi$&amp;* and he was too weak to do anything. We all know why Biden was VP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't forget the whining and gnashing of teeth. Then there will be the raunchy corpse of some fake roadkill they try to pull out of the Democratic hat. Hold your noses ...💩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sourpatchlyds That looks sooooo good! I may even try one... It would be the second Starbucks coffee ☕ I have purchased!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is bigger than the election. Middle east peace is emerging...it took a non-political, not PC @realDonaldTrump to crack the eggshells and turn up the burner. Pray for Peace 🙏☮️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Efff twitter‼️and their censorship...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And you will be pissing into the fuel tank even if you could afford the $8 a gallon like in other countries! Don't forget, excise taxes are a percentage based on the retail sail price.

<|startoftext|>@G_TheOriginal @realDonaldTrump It just shows that #Obiden candidacy truly exist. The Democratic campaign is all theatre and we all know who is manipulating the #BidenHarris puppet.

<|startoftext|>These pundits think they are our brain masters! The unelected fruit of the media elites. Taking partisan sides publicly on air should destroy any credibility about being unbiased.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your Senate leaders just chickened out of the Senate Judiciary Committee vote! C'mon man... Y'all just ran away from the fight. Is that your plan if you are elected President? I guess you have done it for 46 years; so there's no surprise! #WalkAwayFromDemocrats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, they feel that the money is a gift...🥴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump2020Landslide Get out the vote!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you vote for Democrats, you are voting #GovernmentbyEmotion instead of logic. It is airing right now on Fox! @foxnewspolitics on youtube. Spartacus speaks🤡🐠<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Senate Dems make fools of themselves on the steps of the Capitol. They boycott the vote in the committee then whine about the committee vote! What bullshit! "If it sounds like we are repeating each other's points ... We are not lacking originality."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RBReich Prove it! Link's please!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMirror @Italians4Trump That is still a coin toss. Then what is the likelihood of finding the probable cause even if they can reach it? Multiply the two probalities and ask if it it worth it? We already know that better electronic flight following is needed. Work on that to prevent the next lost flight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They have reached the summit of the hypocritical 💩, congratulations CNN.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dan hits it out of the park in this show. He starts off with a dissection of platform censorship and how the left is using it as a covert propaganda tactic to hide the truth. It ends up with the truth about the Democratic  tax plan.  https://t.co/VHD2XlY7x3<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ACMESalesRep @business @BloombergNEF I am questioning the headline.

<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden is the leader of the party that wants to control everything in your life!  He is against many of your values and is the worst kind of bully...

<|startoftext|>Lagging power grid infrastructure development and deployment poses a grave threat to the progress of sustainable energy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This deficit must be addressed before dumping vast amounts of resource into further deploying alternative energy without the ability to deliver it when and where needed virtually instantaneously. This nation still deals with rolling brownouts and blackouts even with overcapacity!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The lack of fundamental infrastructure to transport and store huge amounts of electrical energy across large distances is the fail of wind and solar. Even now our electrical grid infrastructure lags far behind our ability to produce clean and renewable energy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I generally agree. However, solar energy technologies have emerged and are partially successful. But then there is the Solinda disaster brought on by wild claims which delayed the industry IMHO a decade or more. Over expectation breeds sloppiness, ignoring a basic big picture<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>He enlists the help of Pelosi(provided she isn't voted out) and other powerful Democrats, perhaps some RINOs, + the SQUAD to form a revisionist government in exchange for a powerful cabinet position or commensurate position of executive power.

<|startoftext|>Speculation: President Obama knows the Democratic party has gone berserk. He is laying low until chaotic end game(Nov 4 until Jan 6th, 2021).

<|startoftext|>Our fundamental liberties are at stake! You talk about the elimination of Obamacare yet you are willing to destroy the most vital underpinnings of our freedoms. I can assure you that a majority of Americans can see through the Radical Lefts to overturn our most basic freedoms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You advocate the virtual disempowerment of the Supreme Court as a third nonpolitical branch of government. This is a radical view. Your party advocates a major shift toward  socialism, a single populist government leaning toward marxism and totalitarian mandate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenTedCruz summed up your hypocrisy. You misrepresented the facts in Citizens United,  Roe and the Heller cases. The biggest irony is that the Democratic party does not represent democracy at all. Your party has been reduced to a thinly veiled attack on the Republic at Large.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The separation of powers and checks and balances in our trilateral government is nothing to be taken lightly. You condemn the influence of money in the process, yet you don't address the money influence of major global corporations, the media and entertainment industries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I find that despicable. Your juggling act of your cue cards to "tee up" the forthcoming attack on her character was deeply concerning. Not a single question to the nominee. You are playing to the uneducated and throng and mob of the media driven majority.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenWhitehouse Respectfully, your performance at yesterday's confirmation hearing was completely irrelevant to the topic at hand; i.e. the qualifications of Judge Amy Barret to serve on the supreme court.

<|startoftext|>The idea that refunding police will improve disenfranchised communities is almost as absurd as the premise (espoused by the leader in another big city) that  rioting and property destruction isn't violence.

<|startoftext|>Yup, most of these protesters can't read, let alone have insurance. The riots are being driven by people who will benefit from the devaluation of these properties. People are morons...if they think the organizers are out to help them! Quite the contrary.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WashTimes @marcorubio What were you thinking? I couldn't believe my ears... This does not help! I hope your constituency won't be sorry they voted for you. I hope you clarify this unsupportive stance for @realDonaldTrump .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @chucktodd  @SenSchumer @RepDavidEPrice   https://t.co/x0Irp5NjXu  Maybe this will help your decision about border obstacles...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moronic...barriers aren't barriers!😂😂😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True! They are like RED RINOS....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Waste of money and law enforcement! Go get some rapists or drug traffickers you morons!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would you be happy had they been released into the USA to have your children eat and play at the fast food restaurants, schools, day cares they visited? We need #ImmigrationReform now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepDavidEPrice I saw your morning @FoxNews interview where you evaded questions on whether you would support a physical barrier as part of border security packaged. I was horrified at the flippant and cavalier attitude you expressed. You owe your constituency an answer. #NC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Declare the emergency and then let Nancy and Chuck "win" the budget fight. Way to go @realDonaldTrump . You will have a very strong case. Most citizens and legal residents want their nation protected. Full steam ahead...we have your back in 2020! @dbongino @seanhannity @ICEgov<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes @POTUS ; we, the people support you and ask you to protect our border from invasion. You swore an oath. #BuildTheWall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It means $5.7 Billion to this citizen. Pocket change...down payment on the total amount. Of course the rich senators know nothing about installment purchases! They are too frickin' familiar with expense accounts and credit cards!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ditto🙏👍👏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The first lie on this issue was the @HouseDemocrats promising to fund the border wall in exchange for not deporting the #TPS and #Dreamers in the last congress. Pants on fire... #Nancy and Chuck, send the government back to work! You really think the public won't figure this out?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are not even bothering to try to hide their obstructionism. Good on it for #2020TAKEBACKTHEHOUSE . @GOP should introduce bill to grant vouchers to all who remain at critical jobs despite the shutdown.

<|startoftext|>Taxation without representation! Gotta love it!😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd rather DO right. Morality is subjective to culture, religion and so many other factors. Doing right is the intersection of the laws we live by and our individual philosophy and belief system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LolaFor_Trump @TraciIrving1 I agree with you about the morality of it and that it is a sin against the creator. Unfortunately, I don't think that abortions are likely to be stopped by legislation. I would rather spend my efforts on those already born into this world.

<|startoftext|>What a bunch of BS. Let's see where Quip and Calm go next!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even more so today. The trouble is that "the #Identity" movement has trashed our hopes and dreams. MLK would be deeply saddened to see the divisions that have ensued.

<|startoftext|>@realtexpatriot @bbive @mightyoaks6 @SenTedCruz @RepWillHurd Good point. But there isn't a snowballs chance in hell of tracking down overstaying "guests" and deporting them back in this political climate.

<|startoftext|>@realtexpatriot @bbive @mightyoaks6 @SenTedCruz @RepWillHurd Asylum seekers are a whole different issue. We need a more efficient way to process asylum seekers vs refugees.

<|startoftext|>@realtexpatriot @bbive @mightyoaks6 @SenTedCruz @RepWillHurd How does technology stop someone from crossing a border? Think this through carefully.

<|startoftext|>The nation will remain focused on this national crisis. The @POTUS should declare a national emergency and close the border until the problem is sorted out.

If it were my call I'd close the entire border to certain traffic periodically until Mexico came up with a plan to reduce illegal border traffic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AJentleson I don't know what trump you are talking about. The hate and violent speech mostly seem to be coming from the left. I suggest that you obtain a more rounded and diverse set of news sources and double check quotes. After all; you do represent diversity...correct?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fox5sandiego @MJC_815 Not so stupid 27 year old #caravan member gets free ride home on Mexico's tab! It beats walking! Concerning the remaining 7999 guests of the Mexican authorities... Maybe it would have been better to stop them at the south border bridge?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Nancy, you have the power to live up to your word and fund the wall...fully. America will hold the Democrats responsible if a #ShutDown must be implemented to bring your party back to reality in the immigration issue.

<|startoftext|>Kinda like talking to your EX about how to succeed in your present relationship? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is the best way to get the truth out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #DNC wants cheaper and more effective? I am sure we (the USA)can think of some less expensive and expeditious ways to end illegal immigration. The wall is a humane solution and it protects law abiding people on both sides. Only the ignorant cannot understand that!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Anyone wanna give me odds on her being a one term wonder?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are we needing separate but equal #RSWF (racist suburban white female) benches at soccer games now? You know, to be Totally PC?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is pure idiocy to build homes in poorly managed forests. This situation needs immediate action before more people die and lives are ruined.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Build it...they will leave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boycotting them is counterproductive. Weakening Fox will only invite the left to attempt to influence them more, or worse; attempt a coupé. Yes, Fox has been infiltrated by the left. Supporting conservative shows will keep them in check.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ya think that Mexico has figured out that a flood of immigrants from South America will adversely affect the immigrantion quota to the USA? #NoMasCarvanas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It may work...but is a demoralizing eyesore. We have no hate on our border with Mexico. I am sure that we can build a more aesthetic yet effective barrier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joeyforunity @michaelclearman @real_crab @thecjpearson @JackPosobiec @realDonaldTrump Enjoy your life, Panther. Peace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump plays a tough game of poker...looks like Mexico got stuck holding a bad hand and their hand got called. The "Caravan" is not looking like a big win for the open border people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joeyforunity @michaelclearman @real_crab @thecjpearson @JackPosobiec @realDonaldTrump Why do you think I am talking about you? No way do I see you as seeing yourself as a victim! I have no idea who you are or what you believe...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Acosta needs to apologize, period!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joeyforunity @michaelclearman @real_crab @thecjpearson @JackPosobiec @realDonaldTrump Mr. Joey, your words and your tone do not seem to be in sync. History should remain history and not be used as a club to bludgeon anyone into the mind state of blame/victim identity politics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheScoopSteeve Great example⬆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyCaller I am not often at a loss for words...this does it...silence......................😯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@01_zebra @codeofvets Now that is a refugee from the cold! He has the right idea 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedPillReport @BirdMiler There was a big emotional campaign to pass this. There was virtually no debate. Money poured in from somewhere to provide TV spots appealing to those who feel victimized by the system. It is very flawed in that it doesn't allow case by case discretion was the case previously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IngrahamAngle In some places they prearrange marriages. Imagine the step further of selecting your future in laws before they are even born. Does anyone doubt that it wouldn't be taken to the ultimate extreme in some future culture. How is that for a scary thought? Human dignity is withering.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, one might think that a speaker of a Latin based language (as French is) might have "ouvrir un dictionnaire" before making such a statement.  Cited from  https://t.co/piVPA4aI2x :  Patriotism noun 1.devoted love, support, and defense of one's country; national loyalty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JebBush @justonepatriot I totally agree with Jeb Bush. Remove Snipes immediately after the certification. I also think there should be an investigation into voter registration practices in Broward County.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jim Acosta and Trump have been going at each other since before August 2017  https://t.co/obre20FsXS Obviously, I am not a fan of him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the heck really happened? A lot of us want to know! Has AZ descended into liberal hell? Perhaps conservatives need to "firewall" AZ from the rest of the country?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RBReich DeSantis will have to explain that statement when he takes office. I'll sure everything he does will be put under a microscope. Welcome to the grown up's table, Ron DeSantis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YellowRose1776 @KatTheHammer1 @RepCummings It comes down to fundamental unanswered questions about representation. If non citizens and citizens are lumped into the census without knowing proportions; how can the government be expected or able in its task of legitimate and fair representation of the electorate? #census<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pastormarkburns The stock or the app or both?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marklevinshow @mcarsonaos He should stand strong! He is well qualified and can withstand the radical mob.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Harlan @ClwtrBkAtty @Acosta He does owe the WH an apology. That would be the honorable thing to do. He won't because he thinks that he is hurting Trump's image. I don't think he belongs on that beat. He hasn't got the patience for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rude, disrespectful, or threatening discourse will not be tolerated. A bit of snark is fine when appropriate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HillaryClinton please retire. Thank you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet they all stick up for him...tells you something about them...they are a mob.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is stupid! Nothing to sue over... Acosta was in Trumps House. He has been told to leave! Just how is that an injury? If you throw a party, the people you don't invite can't sue you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree! The fact that these "found" votes were so heavily biased toward one candidate screams of a systemic cause. Until that is determined, the election results should be suspect. I can envision some cases where even a hand recount will not reveal certain types of tampering.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lot of liberals have migrated there and taken up residence. The election post mortem will, IMHO, show that the people who moved from Puerto Rico after the hurricane, were assisted by the democrats in establishing residency and registering them.They were encouraged to vote Blue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy Veterans Day: In loving memory of my dad who served in WWII and dedicated his career to building some of the best darn aircraft fighter bombers types flown by our hero's to support our hero's in all branches of the service. R.I.P.  https://t.co/OeJAJHBPUy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They can try...Rick Scott (future Senator from Florida) will not just roll over!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Counting votes == stealing elections? Wrong! Cheating by miscounting and allowing fraudulent voting steals elections and usurps voter rights. I think Kirsten believes in tribal totalitarian government. That's what I hear from the positions she takes...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jenningslawton I haven't a clue how Snipes earned a PhD, less got elected. Oh wait...she is a radical leftist in one of the most corrupt counties in the state of Florida. I get it now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something seems wrong. 1)No reasons or explanations have been given; that is the most troubling thing. 2) Brenda Snipes seems to be hiding behind a bureaucracy; and that is not good sign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pshill10 I see. Do you think that you were somehow disenfranchised? I stopped answering pollsters when I realized that the information could be used against the person I supported. It can help redirect efforts to areas of weakness and strength. Not to mention the obvious metrics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably says a lot about the electorate demographic there. Transient, nomadic, numerous places of abode. The voting system was designed to work best for stable populations. It probably needs some changes. Unfortunately, some persons won't like what needs to be done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And she is still raising money for the unholy cause.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellogClark @thehill Here's a bowl of Gravy Train...your reward for bringing that to my attention.🍜Btw did the President tell you the rain was the reason? Or is that here say?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LauraLoomer @crowbahr She was in the next room...probably watching y'all on video cam.  I saw the CCTV cam in your video. It is on the wall facing the group, next to the door. She is a sneaky one. What did you think of "Adam and Eva" that she sent out to do her bidding? She may have Phd but is coward.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When things get me down I close my eyes...put my feet on the rudder pedals, my hands on the stick and throttle...and imagine myself; free as a bird, above it all. Then the world comes into view, as it should be: clear, fresh, crisp...smooth but not too. I'm free to skydance🛩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When criminals and butchers of innocents are given empowerment by the uneducated and mindless tribe of politically correct morons we allow to hold office? How about those words for a start?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You are both missing the point. If 20 were detected as mismatches...it puts the entire polling station in question. Those 20 should have never made it into the "batch" as signatures are verified before casting. There is a good reason for the rule to discard! Its not arbitrary!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Getting close to a block and/or a mute...don't clutter the timeline with moronic trivia, please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cernovich @AsheSchow Yes! I did follow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I heard about this last month. I didn't realize it was in the place I grew up in six decades ago. What a shame Nassau County has become a gang haven. What has happened to our once law abiding land, where people value human life and act with civility?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHSommers Glad you pinned this tweet! I immediately followed you! I see that you despise the ridiculous. These faux studies are a hot button for me. BTW, your twitter is highly recommended.👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Candace...twitter doesn't censor or block...they just ELEVATE the priority of the ones that fit their liberal leftist rap. Hahaahahh!  https://t.co/rDEvlY3Inx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More power to Google? Now they are art and content critics as well as censors? f no!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods I admire what you are doing to help anyone...regardless of their point of view.👍👏👏👏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am worn out on politics. It is like playing chess with someone where the result is always a stalemate. After a grueling game, great misery and the loss of all power pieces it ends up in a pawn chase with no winners. Beginning to think it is pointless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who they voted for, or why.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't break out the beverages till the election is certified! Yes, I am a bit superstitious about counting chickens... I am hoping there are no more surprises. I feel a bit better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TaDaaah! And so it begins as I predicted: "The Saga of the Missing Chameleon Ballots," as written and narrated by #BrendaSnipes and the #BrowardCounty #ElectionFraud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait...they will accidentally "lose" a truckload of ballots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sure, why not...they are only laws...any Broward County #Dem in good standing doesn't take laws seriously! Laws are passed only for stupid middle aged republicans to follow...every one knows that. #StopTheSteal #ArrestSnipesFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a nightmare!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dbongino @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @IngrahamAngle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BrendaSnipes refuses to show her face at her own news conference! Extremely sad day for #Democracy in this nation. The line has been crossed and the will of the electorate is hobbled by the powerful elitists in the media. #SaveTheNation🇺🇸<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yet they leave boxes of provisional ballots in school closet storerooms! Unreal...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Next, we will hear that the ballots have been "destroyed"... A favorite Democrat tactic; their brand equivalent of the 5th Amendment defense!  #StopTheSteal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WAPO in the dirty diaper bin again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LauraLoomer Thanks for streaming the Broward Co. Elections Board live. "Doctor" Brenda Snipes is either incompetent or totally corrupt. Her lackeys are very well trained, I give credit for that! #BrowardCountyElectionFraud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a sense of humor. Ya gotta love it! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that is unvoiced "yes."<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This past week, we have had multiple groups trying to run through our vehicular lanes, so that's already happening," said Petra Horne, CBP's acting director of field operations. "We're wanting to get the message out in advance to inform these individuals not to do that."

<|startoftext|>A clear invitation to collude for the purpose of influencing an election! @dbongino @marcorubio @LauraLoomer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dirty tricks from from Broward county? Hmmmmm!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good news. I hope that they consider it fairly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To everyone affected by the fires, and I mean everyone...I wish you the best and send my 🙏 and empathy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great advice...and good luck with the matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In light of some recent liberal political tactics, I just hope she won't take off her clothes and pose for a selfie...😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Complacency and apathy...poisons for any democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blasey found a clever but really costly way to file for disability? #worseplanEver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somehow... I just can't be very serious tonight with my tweets. Must be the effect of the smoke from the republican late count ballots being burned in South Florida. Does BleachBit work on optical voting tabulators? Just asking, #BrendaSnipes #StopTheSteal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Wow...some mighty thirsty rocks, pardner!" OR: Life on Mars was always destined to be on the rocks?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It is a shame how the election process has been sabotaged and hijacked by the "no crime is too heinous to win" #Libdems #ElectionFraud #BrendaSnipes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LauraLoomer @suzydymna Thank you, Laura, and good luck! Broward is a county that seems to have big corruption problems with local governance.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I don't know about BO... But they can ask a question if/when called on. The President can choose to answer or not in any way he wants. Follow up questions may be allowed at the President's discretion. That has been protocol for decades AFAIK. WHY does he tweet? It's become a zoo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That stunt by Acosta and the PBS reporters race baiting question really over torqued my propeller hub bolts! 🛩🛩🛩💥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cernovich<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I say that everyone should get in the face of, create a crowd around #reporters who are #Disrespectful #RudeAcosta #combative types and give them no access anywhere at any time! If they want to be the #Headlines then bring it to them! @CNN @nytimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Acosta is a rude, abusive man who assaulted that young intern. I saw it broadcast on your competitors live stream. We don't want #misogynist reporters. @BumillerNYT you should be ashamed of yourself! I am reporting you to the #feminist police. No place for Jim Acosta, anywhere!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BS Alert: False facts! Acosta did accost the young intern! I saw it on live stream. #fakenews #FakeNewsCNN #acosta @nytimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An interesting theory. I wouldn't rule it out. I though about this angle but shelved it a while back. Now I am thinking on it...let's see what happens!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed! This behavior cannot be tolerated or condoned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you watched the entire incident you would know that Acosta was out for Bear, acted like a rabid pit bull. He's lucky he didn't get neutered...oh; actually he did by losing his hard pass!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Regulate "Big Tech" with your checkbook, credit card and piggy bank.
