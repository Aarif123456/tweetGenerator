<|startoftext|>@TheHomBomb @GIGAPANTS @NVIDIAGeForce Especially in a pandemic....what's the point of building another factory when there is no one to be inside them?

<|startoftext|>@jaumersv2 @DDK_Soda @harry_carioca @CyberpunkGame Except it's not unplayable...plenty of people are playing. Just as I am with over 30+ hrs so far. The issue is the hardware limitations. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaumersv2 @DDK_Soda @harry_carioca @CyberpunkGame If they decided to focus on next gen only, all of you would STILL be crying that they left you out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaumersv2 @DDK_Soda @harry_carioca @CyberpunkGame Games need more more Vram, need more graphic memory and 8GB of ram just doesn't cut it anymore, especially when it's DDR3 ram and a CPU with one of the weakest single core performance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaumersv2 @DDK_Soda @harry_carioca @CyberpunkGame It's unfortunate, but clearly this game is being hindered by the CPU of the PS4. I'm not sure why people cant seem to admit that the hardware, in 2020, is getting more and more outdated as we go on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaumersv2 @DDK_Soda @harry_carioca @CyberpunkGame God Of War is a SONY game. Of course that game it's gonna be optimized for PS4. GTA is a remaster, and does come close to the complexity of this game as far as cities and being able to go inside buildings. Last of us 2, also a SONY game.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AlfiesHaircut @DathTheGreat @lyrixs1 @AntonioPedro_Es @sjekkien @reegutd @CyberpunkGame How is understanding that what they're trying to achieve just won't be achieved as well on 8 year old hardware? Muted. Fuck out of here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlfiesHaircut @samL8771 So you're gonna tell me that in that 8 year development span....they did not a thing to improve on that base coding? That they just ignored future tech and assets that came out in that 8 years? Also, let's not be foolish, PC was always the #1 format for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stace_ @walruslives40 @paintedanxiety How is it procrastinating? He has an entirely different work schedule than she does? Her ideal time of cleaning something won't be his since they are polar opposite schedules...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stace_ @walruslives40 @paintedanxiety Ripping away someone's pillow and blanket while they're sleeping from a 12 hour work shift is not dealing with his actions. Sitting down and talking about him forgetting is dealing with his actions. Leave it for him to clean. Clean what you needed, and have a talk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stace_ @WilliamGrobman The problem is that he forgets. He said he would clean it. How is that laziness? Being someone with ADHD such as yourself (which I too have), I would assume you know what it's like to forget things often. So does that mean you're lazy too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stace_ @WilliamGrobman I'm sorry but that's not laziness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sravanasupreme @EyeEdinburgh @theblueHuntress @AITA_reddit Did you read the post and why he does it or just the comments?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stace_ @WilliamGrobman @AITA_reddit He could have put them in there, relaxed for a bit and fell asleep and forgot. I don't know how that's lazy....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stace_ @WilliamGrobman @AITA_reddit How is that being lazy? Working a 12 hour shift isn't lazy. Especially depending on what you do during that 12 hours. I've work 12 hour shifts before and have come home and immediately fell asleep without even eating just because of how exhausted I was that day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@k3nn3t8 @RebornxFate @DathTheGreat @lyrixs1 @AntonioPedro_Es @sjekkien @reegutd @CyberpunkGame Different engine. Different everything.

<|startoftext|>@k3nn3t8 @RebornxFate @DathTheGreat @lyrixs1 @AntonioPedro_Es @sjekkien @reegutd @CyberpunkGame Do you not understand how DEVELOPMENT works? Do you honestly think in that 8 years they didn't do ANYTHING to upgrade for better tech? You just think in 2013 they made that coding and left it? Ignorance is bliss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SekktorPrime @Andresyson @CyberpunkGame Yes, and people have to also understand that's those base consoles have 8 year old hardware. You expect mid-level performance on low spec hardware. Realistic expectations, people.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@theTiredTenor @MrSnowVillers @deseries4 @CyberpunkGame This scene has nothing to do with what the devs achieved with this game. That incident is extremely unfortunate, but that as an argument that it's not a "masterpiece" in this person's view is ludicrous.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheSantoMirko @RebornxFate @DathTheGreat @lyrixs1 @AntonioPedro_Es @sjekkien @reegutd @CyberpunkGame They released a game because there's more to it than just them releasing it.

<|startoftext|>@DathTheGreat @lyrixs1 @AntonioPedro_Es @sjekkien @reegutd @CyberpunkGame There is clearly limitations in the hardware.

<|startoftext|>@DathTheGreat @lyrixs1 @AntonioPedro_Es @sjekkien @reegutd @CyberpunkGame You know what this is from? HARDWARE not being good enough to render in textures. Y'all just don't fucking get it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@N0_1_Specia1 @pascual_acevedo @CyberpunkGame It's not though. People need to realize that in 2012/13 when the PS4 came out that hardware was already old.

<|startoftext|>@patsmakemesad @EAMaddenNFL What you look like right now. It's hilarious. Enjoy your memes and not knowing shit about how real life works.  https://t.co/coPr1Vp10J<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patsmakemesad @EAMaddenNFL Tastes like you cried all over them. Very salty. I don't mind it too much. You have no idea what you're talking about, and seeing that is good enough for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patsmakemesad @EAMaddenNFL Also, the PS4 CPU and Xbox One cpu were weak CPU's. Jaguar had some of the weakest single core performance. But again, think what you will, you seem to know a shit ton about PC's and hardware right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patsmakemesad @EAMaddenNFL I'm not making excuses at all. In fact, I've been shit talking EA for a while. But the fact is, the CPU's were extremely limited in what they could do. Gaming is more than just what you see on your screen. Coding, algorithms, ai, they all use something, right? But hey, whatever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patsmakemesad @EAMaddenNFL Simple: CPU couldn't handle it 6 years ago. Make more sense?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patsmakemesad @EAMaddenNFL CPU couldn't handle the math 6 years ago lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mryoshi027 @EAMaddenNFL The other consoles couldn't handle it. I do agree with them on that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eclipso23 @EAMaddenNFL Most people are getting this free though. But you shouldn't be expecting anything revolutionary. Madden does this every year. All this is, is some shiny new feature that doesn't do anything for the actual fans of madden that want to see it improve.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Missy33836237 @xLionelx @IGNDeals They made 4x the amount of PS5's than they did the PS4. But the demand was too high and production was owed by covid so they weren't able to keep a steady production. People act like sony owes them something and act so entitled. Wtf do you want them to do? It's a pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Palace_of_doubt @slimray11 @PlayStation That's a pity. I really thought you were gonna make a comeback. Ah well. Enjoy not having a PS5. #Muted (I know how me hashtagging really triggers you, so I did this for you, bb)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Palace_of_doubt @slimray11 @PlayStation I literally said all console launches are like this except the pandemic has an affect on it this time....you literally just proved my fucking point üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Palace_of_doubt @slimray11 @PlayStation So I'm not allowed to hashtag something? You're a petulant child, "bro".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Palace_of_doubt @slimray11 @PlayStation You clearly lack picking up sarcasm, so I'll let that one slide. Also, I never mentioned bots?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Palace_of_doubt @slimray11 @PlayStation You apparently weren't alive during the PS4 launch or any other console launch then. All console launches are like this. The difference this time is the pandemic has an affect on the launch. Education is key. Bye.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Palace_of_doubt @slimray11 @PlayStation Got mine off playstation direct, not that it matters any. I don't care about views, "bro".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Palace_of_doubt @slimray11 @PlayStation Or maybe people can act less entitled like SONY owes them something? They made 4x the amount of consoles. The pandemic and the demand was too strong. That isnt on them. Y'all a bunch of whiny entitled children is the problem.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BryanDerrick8 @KtAnneElDeib @PS5StockAlerts Same, this email saved me so much trouble. I've never had a console on launch day before. This was my first time. Every other console release I've waited at least a few months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TickRate_Gaming @_KingzKidBeatz @md_chadwick @KtAnneElDeib @PS5StockAlerts Plus, I have a PC and all the Xbox games are on it anyway, not to mention SONY just had better exclusives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TickRate_Gaming @_KingzKidBeatz @md_chadwick @KtAnneElDeib @PS5StockAlerts Yeah, that 360 launch was hot garbage. I had 2 360's that had the red ring. Both were sent back and both came back and did it again. Honestly, that was the generation that turned me into a SONY fan. I've been salty ever since and won't buy an Xbox.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BluePanther1454 @KtAnneElDeib @TEK_TORO @PS5StockAlerts The obvious answer is we're in the middle of a pandemic. Production is slowed, thus not able to make enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KtAnneElDeib @_KingzKidBeatz @PS5StockAlerts Yeah, it was.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ILikeBrazil1 @brendansfoley @JohnDoe14978774 @pjpkowski He's not wrong though. They are known for bugs and glitches so much it's a meme. That's not necessarily a good thing.

<|startoftext|>@Don_Keyoto @nuyorican78 @j_beara @jamesevershort @IGNDeals Don't expect anything good from the update. It's not gonna be revolutionary, it never is with EA. With that being said, buy it cheap on PS4 now and get the free update, I agree. That's what I did. I ain't paying full price for a Madden game ever again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SMILEY75932172 @GreeneeFredrick And the fact he blocked me for calling him out too üòÇ  Dude prolly gonna fuck people over.  https://t.co/8KgtQlXJDt<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We all have the same thing in common, and that's video games and wanting to be enthralled in a great experience wether it be single player or multiplayer. Wether it's a short experience or a long one. Just enjoy what you enjoy, and let's end all of this nonsense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and it doesn't make me less of a person. At the end of the day it's electronics, and you ain't gonna take that with you when you die so why get so damn serious about it? Just enjoy what you want to play, on what you want to play and call it a day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a great time to be a gamer between the new consoles and GPU's coming out. Honestly so sick of the console wars and people acting like the PS5 and the Xbox Series X are really that different. I prefer PlayStation, and the exclusives they have. Doesn't make me better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Valdezspeaks @datavibe_io @SoringFins @Calinativealwa1 @realDonaldTrump Oh I know. He's not that great of a troll. I've been trolled harder by a 6 year old.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NoyouPony @Hamster10949727 @infrarogue89 Up until recently it was, it's still made by SONY, and an exclusive when it comes to console.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoyouPony @Hamster10949727 @infrarogue89 You can deny all you want, these games were voted on by GAMERS as some of the best games to come out. But keep kidding yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoyouPony @Hamster10949727 @infrarogue89 Yes, fortnite is generic, good job reading the room with missed sarcasm. Again, you're showing your lack of knowledge.   Uncharted 4: 18hrs Until Dawn: 10hrs Detroit: Become Human: 28hrs Marvel's spider-man: 26 hours Days Gone: 51hrs God of war: 31hrs Horizon zero dawn: 44hrs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoyouPony @Hamster10949727 @infrarogue89 You had no point to prove, considering none of those games are "generic". But believe whatever you want. You clearly need the internet win more than I do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hamster10949727 @NoyouPony @infrarogue89 Yes, because Until Dawn, Detroit: Become Human, The Last Guardian, The Order 1886, Shadow of the Colossus and many others I could name are beat em ups.   Good job, you officially have no idea what you're talking about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoyouPony @Hamster10949727 @infrarogue89 Generic üòÇ  Alright my dude. Have fun with fortnite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Schmenkie @infrarogue89 Played*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Schmenkie @infrarogue89 No I didn't....I said the last one I play was horizon 1 and 2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@r0me0ne @infrarogue89 You forgot to capitalize your W in "word", sir. It's ok, we all get lost at some point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Schmenkie @infrarogue89 I would rather play iracing. Far more customization than Forza ever had. Forza just isn't what it could be, in my opinion, especially comparing to other racing "sims".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kaynow61 @infrarogue89 You've probably never played the ones you're trashing either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Schmenkie @infrarogue89 What gameplay in forza? If driving around is really "gameplay". Yes, I've actually played multiple Forzas. The last one I played was Horizon/2. I'll give you reach, but that's about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kaynow61 @infrarogue89 Don't be salty that I called your 3 favorite games trash.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@giodbrassanini @infrarogue89 My guess is double palm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Schmenkie @infrarogue89 Again, the story wasn't ground breaking, but the gameplay was very much on point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Schmenkie @infrarogue89 And? Halo hasn't been good since Halo 3 and Forza is Forza, mindless racing around getting bonus points for wrecking into walls and stop signs.   The last of us 2 was good. Despite all the negative reviews from bots and insecure men.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@datavibe_io @SoringFins @Calinativealwa1 @realDonaldTrump Ah yes, because people can't be gamers and have an education. What a great take that is. Good job, bud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SoringFins @Calinativealwa1 @datavibe_io @realDonaldTrump It's really hard to fathom for you guys that people just didn't want Donald Trump, huh? Must be nice living in a world of marshmallows and make believe.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NoyouPony @Hamster10949727 @infrarogue89 It's ok, you don't have to be edgy. We all know you were one of the ones saying "I wish I could play it" when it was announced.  Also, it's ok to admit when something is good and you can't have it. Do you also go around shouting at people with a better car that theirs is trash?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Braves2008 @infrarogue89 You're full of grade school zingers today, huh? Must feel empowering.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@poke__boy @Hamster10949727 @NoyouPony @infrarogue89 Metacritic is such a lousy example of reviews. That site is among the worst of bot accounts üòÇ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SugarCubeOfSal1 @infrarogue89 I just think PS puts out better exclusives. Other than that, do what you want, play what you want, his take was just bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SugarCubeOfSal1 @infrarogue89 Enjoy what you like then, it's all subjective anyways. Honestly I don't give a shit what you play. I own a switch, PS4, PS5, had an Xbox one til any game I wanted to play was made available on my PC anyways (thanks xbox). I'm a gamer. I don't give a shit about petty wars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Braves2008 @infrarogue89 Good one, incel. üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@giodbrassanini @infrarogue89 Because that would ruin his argument.

Some people would rather console war instead of enjoying everything.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FacelesPhoenix @infrarogue89 You want to call the last of us 2 a trash game but then say gears 5 is good....oye. I'm the one that should evaluate my life? Alright...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Braves2008 @infrarogue89 I'm a PCMASTERRACER, I'm not a Pony. I just enjoy playstation exclusives. But nice meme.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShitHawk84 @infrarogue89 YOU'VE never touched them again. That doesn't mean others haven't. I've played all the games listed at least twice, if not 3 times with the exception of last of us 2, since it's fairly newer and I went to other games that came out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SugarCubeOfSal1 @infrarogue89 Forza is good for 20hrs or so. Then it's worthy of being put down and never touched again, let's be honest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hamster10949727 @infrarogue89 Nope. I didn't let all the fan outrage ruin the game for me. I have a mind of my own. The game looked and played great, and even though the story wasn't ground breaking I still enjoyed playing it.  So for me, that's a win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@infrarogue89 Gears 5 = üóëÔ∏è Halo after 3 = üóëÔ∏è Forza = üóëÔ∏è Sea of Thieves = üèÜ  Uncharted 4 = üèÜ The Last of us 2 = üèÜ God of war = üèÜ Spiderman = üèÜ  That's the main difference here. Also comparing games that are multiplayer vs games that are single player based on prolonged playability is cheap<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Oh look, another hateful tweet from our soon to be former "President", if you can even call him that. What an embarrassment to the United States.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@5447mynumber1 @RexChapman Need I go on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@5447mynumber1 @RexChapman The Trump administration¬†rescinded¬†guidance geared toward protecting lower-income people from being buried in legal fees.  Trump‚Äôs administration¬†cut¬†support for prisoner halfway houses for those transitioning back into society.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@5447mynumber1 @RexChapman Trump took us backwards on criminal justice by rescinding and weakening Obama-era protections on policing.  Trump‚Äôs DOJ has¬†pulled back¬†on Obama-era efforts to¬†rebuild trust¬†between community members and police, all while Trump has advocated a return to¬†brutal policing tactics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@5447mynumber1 @RexChapman Trump rolled back Obama-era efforts geared toward protecting black students from discrimination in school punishment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@5447mynumber1 @RexChapman Trump‚Äôs tax law disproportionately hurt African Americans.  African Americans were¬†disproportionately left out¬†from Trump‚Äôs tax cut.  African American households received only¬†5%¬†of the benefits from Trump‚Äôs tax law, despite making up about¬†13%¬†of U.S. households.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DigitalSoulja @_Michelangelo__ @BCharpiot @realDonaldTrump @ABC @washingtonpost Gee, I wonder who else isn't being honest because he's afraid if he loses the new AG is going to look into things they've done for the last 4 years? ü§î<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@adamzzworld @SirJamesKush @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump @ABC @washingtonpost Actually, it's not the same way. Because Biden won't both the electoral college AND the popular vote. Trump lost the popular vote in 2016. This was an overall sweep for Biden. It's funny watching delusional Trumpers blindly throw support for this guy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@APRILANDERSON12 @BlackMageVivi1 @myview1872 @missnancypants7 @RVastate @seanhannity He didnt say don't wear a mask, but when it was originally stated mask wearing helped protect people he made it a point to say it was voluntary and he wasn't going to do it, thus making it political. Since then, most if not all attending his rallies have not worn one. It's simple<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarylandNickG @Xulthus @realDonaldTrump And to think you're trying to run for Congress......OOF.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarylandNickG Resist what exactly? Finally having a President who wants to unite people instead of tearing them apart?

<|startoftext|>@MWadabada @SKD72328316 @TrumpGirlofMN @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump Lmao Biden had 4 million more popular votes to Trump, and beat him by a large margin in the electoral college. Quit kidding yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MWadabada @SKD72328316 @TrumpGirlofMN @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump No, I'm pretty sure most people would accept a landslide loss and not question the integrity of our election process and Democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@L99270588 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Yes, and 74 million legal voters voted for Joe Biden. Get over it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OutspokenRepub1 @NiceIsLife1 @AgapeLoveAllDay @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump I found the Alex Jones burner account everyone.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@glennbr80467751 It's called mail in ballots....you....the thing Donald Trump told people NOT to do. So when they count the mail in votes which are WIDELY democratic votes.....use some logic maybe? Stop feeding into Donald Trump's sore loser mentality. He lost, with 0 evidence of actual fraud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@newyorker_one @Shaddow13 @realDonaldTrump The only thing we're gonna see is Donald Trump clinging to every piece of furniture as they drag him out of the oval office. The outcome won't change just because you buy into his lies.  https://t.co/loa8h7kYBR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lmao...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uhhjames @McJesse No President has ever been perfect to not hate some sort of policy they've had. Trump was just on a whole other level.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@asadayaz @LACity The fog of hatred is almost lifted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's funny. Biden got over 74 million. Not only did you lose the popular vote, you lost the electoral college too. Get over it, snowflake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He definitely said "buzz off", but I still love it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevinwardrop @rpeppersXx @Kazeem I took the song and just spliced "fuck Donald Trump" for 5 minutes just for today's outing. Shits gonna be on repeat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Julia_CaSsian I don't see this happening to be honest. Republicans will probably control the senate, so it's going to be an uphill battle. We'll see what happens. I'm hoping for the best. I'm happy right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pierre_Krause @JessicaValenti I'm sure there was, but we've also had a trying 4 years and with the pandemic, excitement is probably at an all time high.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YNB Let's not dance too much, pandemic is still a thing! Be safe people....from the virus AND evil Trump supporters looking to do harm to people!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeTheBard Thanks, Mike!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Joe Biden won, this is a good day for America. Remember to still be safe out there, especially today.

<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Let's get to work, Joe. It's gonna be a hard battle. You weren't my first choice, but Donald Trump wasn't the leader we needed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shawn_louk @realDonaldTrump Land doesn't vote, dumbass. People do. I hope this is a troll.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>His bullying tactics, his behaviors was enough.   Joe Biden, keep your word. You work for us. Let's get this done.  #46President #BidenHarris #GetToWork #SaveAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In all seriousness now. #Biden was not my choice of President, but #Trump was unfit, unhinged, deranged and was not the person to be leading this nation. His lies and undermining of this election process is all we need to see how he handles adversity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Refreshing Trump's Twitter feed like...  https://t.co/3FbWAy5lC9<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey Keem, I know you're not that smart and that's why you chose to create stupid content called drama alert, but maybe understand how counting works. When ballots come in bunches, of course it's going to spike. But hey, you're a Trumper. Can't expect you to use your brain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God, this dude is the biggest idiot living right now. The "President" doesn't understand how voting works. He can't comprehend how mail in ballots are counted without calling it a fraud. The intelligence of a peanut.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FOX61News The biggest moron living.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoKingofZombies @PlayStation Did you even read the article? They literally said, instead of having people wait in lines.....they are making people buy them online. FUCKING READ THE ARTICLE BEFORE YOU COMMENT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StaticCorn It's absolutely ridiculous. He is the reason for most, if not all the division in this country right now. His base tried to kidnap the governor of Michigan because he was on social media telling them to liberate it. This man is a cancer to society.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MitchGr86901505 @mrhughes808 @RatedKennex @TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump Don't forget, Trump is also a draft dodger. Has no actual respect for veterans and doesn't care about the poor parts of America. But again, you're free to your own delusional thoughts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MitchGr86901505 @mrhughes808 @RatedKennex @TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump And Trump got stupidly rich off his Daddy and came out less rich because he's a fraud.

<|startoftext|>@Dones_HD @YNHH Problem is I don't think there is much answers. This shit was discovered in the 1800's and they still don't know shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MVPDune @SadnessBruhh @Shalece9 @MrBeastYT If you call that roasting. But it's all good, fall weather over her, it actually didn't bother me that much. Warm toasty feeling. Preciate' it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SadnessBruhh @MVPDune @Shalece9 @MrBeastYT Nah, I'm good. Relax, man, it's Twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disgusting.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SadnessBruhh @MVPDune @Shalece9 @MrBeastYT Obviously he wasn't concerned. I'm just not going to respond the way you and he wants. Have a good day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MVPDune @Shalece9 @MrBeastYT Already getting it, thanks for your concern though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MVPDune @Shalece9 @MrBeastYT No, I think it is. Seek help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MVPDune @Shalece9 @MrBeastYT If posting stupid comments on Twitter makes you feel better as a person, then so be it. But I would like to suggest seeking a therapist for your pent up anger. You have some inner issues going on if this is the kind of comment you want to leave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shalece9 @bigniga69 @MrBeastYT I really hope you're able to get some relief soon. This is a hard time for a lot of us and it's only getting more difficult as time goes on. Stay strong, keep your head up as much as you can. We're all gonna get through this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigniga69 @Shalece9 @MrBeastYT We need more people to be less asshole-y, like yourself, and more people to be empathetic. Unfortunately I'm in a situation myself and I can't do anything in the help department, but that doesn't mean we should be dragging this woman for doing what she needs to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigniga69 @Shalece9 @MrBeastYT You criticize her for reaching out to people for money, but if you were in a legitimate situation like this, you'd want people to help too. There's nothing wrong with that, and there's nothing wrong with asking for help in your darkest times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigniga69 @Shalece9 @MrBeastYT A phone now-a-days is needed. Most people don't have landlines anymore and use a cell phone as a main source. People need a phone to call 911 or to make Dr appointments etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigniga69 @Shalece9 @MrBeastYT Listen man...or woman, not going to assume your gender. You don't know peoples situations. Just because the kid has some sort of "smart watch" does not mean it was purchased within the last couple months. You asking why she hasn't stopped paying her phone bill is stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel like we're both drowning here, her with this bullshit and me financially at the moment. I don't know what to do. I feel lost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm having to take off work because she's gotten so bad at times with her blood pressure spiking and her heart rate getting incredibly high, I'm too nervous to leave her alone. I don't know how to help her and I think that's the hardest part.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We called to make an appointment to see a GI specialist, but the best they could do is early November and that's with me calling to already try and get it moved forward as her condition seems to get worse. What and how the hell do people combat this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They think it's #cyclicvomitingsyndrome But I'm not even sure if that anymore, and if it is really that we have ZERO ways of trying to battle it and I'm so lost and hurt seeing her in so much pain and discomfort every hour of the day, and we just want answers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know what to do anymore. My GF has been to hospital twice in the last month at @YNHH and each time she leaves we get zero answers. She's constantly throwing up, and I mean CONSTANTLY. She can at times maybe go 10-15 minutes if that without vomiting. The hospital says<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is food not made to be addicting? Are books not made to be addicting? Are tv shows not made to be addicting? Are puzzles not made to be addicting?

<|startoftext|>@BjLloyd3 @IHateFacebook7 @JS1fontes @politstrip @Alyssa_Milano And yet, on national television he didn't and said to "stand back and stand by".

<|startoftext|>@WesOlesen @FOX61News @JennBNews I don't expect you to read anything though, or to actually look at evidence and comprehend it because that's not what you guys do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WesOlesen @FOX61News @JennBNews  https://t.co/EYM0b0SRiY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WesOlesen @FOX61News @JennBNews The fact Trump is fine with absentee ballots but not mail-in-voting is funny because it's literally the same thing. Yet he's pushing his agenda and you all are eating it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WesOlesen @FOX61News @JennBNews You tell me how many people get away with it. Also, there are measures in place to protect voter fraud such as negating any ballots that are duplicates to prevent multiple votes. You guys have no legitimate idea about what you're talking about, you just repeat what Trump says.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IGNDeals Why are we supporting gray market sellers like CDkeys?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IHateFacebook7 @BjLloyd3 @JS1fontes @politstrip @Alyssa_Milano Let's not get in this tussle, because no one is gonna come out as the winner here. I don't even like Joe Biden anyways. But unfortunately, Trump is so much more of a liar and a conman among other things. On the scale of "who is worse", Trump takes the prize.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IHateFacebook7 @BjLloyd3 @JS1fontes @politstrip @Alyssa_Milano Neither was Trump telling white supremacists to stand back and stand by. Or when asked if he would peacefully transition if he lost saying "we'll have to see".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump would love this since he's all about numbers. Republicans taking the lead in almost every category for negligence when it comes to Covid-19, good job guys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WesOlesen @FOX61News @JennBNews Again, proving that it doesn't go unchecked and it gets corrected as the mail was mailed out and the offender was caught. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WesOlesen @FOX61News @JennBNews And they were arrested. Further proving that anyone who does do this is caught and they know about it. You're just proving more and more that it doesn't go unchecked, and that it's actually safe to still use this method. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BjLloyd3 @JS1fontes @politstrip @Alyssa_Milano Pretty obvious to anyone without blinders.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BrayanGonzaldz @Danification4u @PlayStation Not to mention, do you honestly think that engineers didn't think of this already making the console?

<|startoftext|>@BrayanGonzaldz @Danification4u @PlayStation He's not though, because no one had run the console long enough to prove how much dust will be getting in to the system. Obviously dust is a big issue. But until we have real life usage, you have no idea how much dust will accumulate in the heat sink, if at all.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kornsteven @MontanaSoldier @Danification4u @PlayStation "No noise"  And obviously it's going to be got. It's a console running games at those levels.

<|startoftext|>@TheSandersSimp @robertbabble @Arjun51787240 @TigerCA123 @PlayStation The Xbox one only went to 900p and was far less powerful than the PS4. So it did have an advantage. It lost the advantage when it released the Pro and Xbox with the one x.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not a damn call has been given. I am ABSOLUTELY disgusted with you right now. We should not be dealing with this. Our loved one deserves better, and so do we.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YNHH You guys have had my gf under your care for 10hrs, and have failed to give any updates to me, as her emergency contact and boyfriend. Myself, her family and friends have all been given the SAME BULLSHIT VAGUE response. "The nurse will call you back". 5 hours later,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lauriehall0923 @miriamjablon @Poppy65643547 @ebrws @SCBeachWriter @politico Yep, and after 4 years Trump still hasn't released his tax returns and lies infront of everyone watching about it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ColtsFanInCincy @j00189579 @NFL @PatrickMahomes I disagree with the argument of using that Brady is a system QB to talk about his accomplishments, considering all QB's could be considered system QB's by that logic, so it's kind of irrelevant. Everything else I'd agree with though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@j00189579 @ColtsFanInCincy @NFL @PatrickMahomes Brady was a game manager.....and I never said he didn't play "well". But the defense is what shined those seasons, and any Patriots fan knows that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@j00189579 @ColtsFanInCincy @NFL @PatrickMahomes So you're saying if Patrick Mahomes wasn't the QB in KC right now and let's say.....Alex Smith was....KC would be just as dominant as they are now with Mahomes?  Stop being salty, dude. It's a new season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@j00189579 @ColtsFanInCincy @NFL @PatrickMahomes But if you wanna play that game.....the defense is what carried that team for 3 of those 4 years you wanna talk about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@j00189579 @ColtsFanInCincy @NFL @PatrickMahomes Yeah I'm gonna pretend like I understand what the hell you're saying in the first part. Mahomes has been in the league how many years and has a ring already? How often does that happen? Mahomes is a stud, and you're lying to yourself about his potential. Don't be one of those.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@j00189579 @ColtsFanInCincy @NFL @PatrickMahomes Bro, as a Pats fan, Brady is the goat. But you sound super salty about Mahomes. This kid has the potential to be the best.

<|startoftext|>@CallMeNoNameW @ABUSlV3 @ITulliusCicero @kidmexi17 @w1ndyy @Slasher So the point that was being made is, games aren't ALWAYS cheaper physical anymore. We're going into a digital only platform, games will be discounted more now, and have been.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CallMeNoNameW @ABUSlV3 @ITulliusCicero @kidmexi17 @w1ndyy @Slasher But that's not really the main point. Digital sales are becoming more and more of a thing.

<|startoftext|>@ABUSlV3 @ITulliusCicero @kidmexi17 @w1ndyy @Slasher Yes, used. Which doesn't really bother me as I don't shop at GameStop because they are a rip off. I buy games new anyways, which ultimately cost $60 regardless.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nebraskawoman76 @smileyavocado1 @Chuck224567 @M2Madness "We like freedom and shit". That's such a funny thing, because no where was anyone talking about freedom or taking it away.

<|startoftext|>@nebraskawoman76 @smileyavocado1 @Chuck224567 @M2Madness Except "ignorant" isn't a slang that was invented to be demoralizing or hurtful to a group of people. Your immaturity is really showing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RoxannaMeta @kukachoo42 @amyhoy @danidonovan Yes, clearly. However, as I've stated before, being defensive is a symptom and not always an "attack" or putting blame on there other person as a "tactic".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amyhoy @kukachoo42 @danidonovan If this is a symptom of someone's add/adhd, I don't feel as though it's an excuse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kukachoo42 @amyhoy @danidonovan And apologizing is the difference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kukachoo42 @amyhoy @danidonovan I disagree. Not everyone who gets defensive and tries to explain what happened is guilt tripping or trying to put it in the other person. Nor do I consider it an excuse, as a symptom that you cannot control has made you do something. Realizing it made you do something and (1/2)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kukachoo42 @amyhoy @danidonovan I don't necessarily think being defensive is an attack though. Getting defensive isn't the right thing to do, but trying to explain why or what happened doesn't make it an attack.   But owning up to your mistakes is the way to go.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@coffinchrist @MoonKnight313 @DeadliestGinger @AITA_reddit But she did specify......hence asking for different ingredients.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeadliestGinger @GreenishAnder @MoonKnight313 @AITA_reddit So........if it was a diabetic child do you think she would have agreed to make the cake? Didn't sound like the ingredients were the problem ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AITA_reddit NTA.  That's her business. It's not like making a cake for a dog is demeaning or anything. People do this all the time. She just seems like a shitty person. If that was me, I'd be delighted to make a cake for any animal.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StaticCorn It's really not worth $60. It's worth $20 at best. All it really is, is an updated roster. They don't deserve the $60 for the game on top of all the money they make from MUT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just goes to show you @EAMaddenNFL doesn't fix their games. It's the same shit, year after year after year. From this point forward, I will not be buying Madden.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump They removed it to respect another religion. We all know you hate Muslims, and wouldn't be respectful of them either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coachperkski @RexChapman @realDonaldTrump Some caucus members left out "one nation under God" when reciting the Pledge of Allegiance during individual meetings convened¬†by allied groups. It is misleading to say it was intentionally removed or "the DNC omitted it." Videos show that the phrase was included each night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coachperkski @RexChapman @realDonaldTrump During two of those¬†meetings¬†‚Äì¬†the¬†LGBTQ caucus meeting¬†and the¬†Muslim Delegates Assembly¬†‚Äì¬†when the pledge was recited, "under God" was omitted.  "Individual meetings". They said it for the actual DNC events on stage. You should probably keep reading.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coachperkski @RexChapman @realDonaldTrump So it wasn't omitted for Muslims at an individual meeting?  ü§î<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump When asked what's your favorite passage you said "all of them" because you've never read the Bible. You went golfing during a pandemic and killed thousands of people. You aren't godly, you're the devil himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Let's not pretend you give a damn about God. You literally sexually assaulted countless women, said great things about a dude who sex trafficked children and probably had a part in it yourself. You don't even know how to hold a Bible for a photo op.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fakeifier @alpha10_ @IAmJericho A lot of deaths could also have been avoided if your "POTUS" didn't call it a hoax and actually acted, rather than go play golf. But it doesn't surprise me at all that this is your logic of thinking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fakeifier @alpha10_ @IAmJericho So you're going to compare a pandemic to car crashes, huh? All while saying; "There's gonna be casualties" (which by the way is basically saying fuck those people, and I'd like to see you tell that to all those families who lost someone due to covid, you dick).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alpha10_ @fakeifier @IAmJericho Yeah because 2% is such a small number right? Do people realize that 2% of the world's population is roughly 140,000,000 people? That's a lot.....but only 2% though so, fuck em.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IAmJericho That 7 could turn into more. Not everyone shows symptoms at the same time, dude. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coachperkski @RexChapman @realDonaldTrump Trump said the Democrats removed it at the DNC, which they did not. It was omitted at individual meetings, and Democrats did not say it couldn't be used. Therefore, what Trump said is indeed false, as it was used at the DNC events. It's not hard to understand.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ajroo Finally someone else who agrees this beta has been a dumpster fire. I'm a Marvel fan through and through, but this game just isn't what I myself as a fan envisioned when I finally get a marvel game. The maps look like someone took content from the unreal engine maker and just 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PlayAvengers is meh. I expected more from @CrystalDynamics  to be honest. Granted, it's a beta, but it's a look through the glass into what the game is supposed to be like and I've got to say I'm not all that impressed. Spiderman and the Arkham games have spoiled me.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LundgaardK @mdussault77 @Cooleystakes @dylnlowe @Rosasburner @AdamSchefter @RosenhausSports Stephong Gilmore, JC Jackson, Jones, McCourty....it's not like the secondary is absolute garbage. The front could use some work, sure, but we don't know how these guys are gonna play. For all we know, they have a good year. We just don't know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mdussault77 @LundgaardK @Cooleystakes @dylnlowe @Rosasburner @AdamSchefter @RosenhausSports I have really high hope for Devin Asiasi, and I'm probably in the minority here. But I like this kid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mdussault77 @Cooleystakes @LundgaardK @dylnlowe @Rosasburner @AdamSchefter @RosenhausSports I wouldn't say it's MUCH better, but it's definitely not TERRIBLE either. It all depends on health. If Harry and Sanu can be healthy and productive so Edelman doesn't shoulder the entire offense that'd be great. Defense wise, I think we're still pretty good even with the losses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cooleystakes @mdussault77 @LundgaardK @dylnlowe @Rosasburner @AdamSchefter @RosenhausSports I'll take an ok QB at this point. I really believe the guy can do great things working with Josh McDaniels, but time will only tell. From everything that's coming out, the guy is ready to play, and I'm excited to see what he can do (if there's even a season).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cooleystakes @mdussault77 @LundgaardK @dylnlowe @Rosasburner @AdamSchefter @RosenhausSports Where did I say they could go 11-5? ü§î  And yes, that's why I said if Cam can stay healthy. Obviously injuries has hindered his career as of late. But never say never. There's been plenty of athletes who have suffered some pretty bad injuries that have come back to ball.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cooleystakes @mdussault77 @LundgaardK @dylnlowe @Rosasburner @AdamSchefter @RosenhausSports Anything on offense will be better than last year. If Cam is healthy and can play, his mobility opens up a lot of different things Josh McDaniels can put together. Let's not say we're playoff bound, but we're definitely not as screwed as some would think.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HurlThe @CameronNewton @IconicSaga Lol shut the hell up. Brady made that franchise for 20 years. The least any fan of the Patriots could do is stop being such a fair weather Brady fan and turning on him because the team always refuses to pay players until it's too late. Brady took paycut after paycut.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@veestash @richard_forget @dixieleeislucky "Bro", you're free to have your opinion, but you're not going to change mine. I like meat.

<|startoftext|>@richard_forget @dixieleeislucky It's called population control too. But do you, boo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@richard_forget @dixieleeislucky That's good for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@richard_forget @dixieleeislucky Forcing your veganism on everyone isn't a way to get people on to your side either. Because again, it's not for everyone. Google search it, see how many people agree that it's not for everyone too. People have tried and gone back to meat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@richard_forget @dixieleeislucky Saying "plant based diet is for everyone" is a false statement. Whether you want to argue about "meat not being a food group" or not, the human species has been hunting since it's creation. It's what we did/do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@richard_forget @dixieleeislucky You can believe whatever you wish. I don't hunt, and I don't kill animals myself, but I'm also not going to tell someone who hunts deer to not do it. Because truthfully, fresh venison is much better than the processed foods and is good. There's nothing immoral about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@richard_forget @dixieleeislucky And that doesn't work for everyone. If it did, there would be no arguments. However, each person is different, and different dieting/ways of eating does not work for everyone. Maybe take that into consideration first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DominicVFX @dixieleeislucky And trust me, I know all about the plant based diets etc etc etc. But that doesn't work for everyones bodies, and not taking that into consideration is probably ignorance as well. But I appreciate the compliment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DominicVFX @dixieleeislucky Thank you :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dixieleeislucky I mean.....animals have been killed since the creation of man. People need to eat somehow and most leaves don't give you enough nutrition.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ABelgianWaffle_ @TheSwordmouse Is the place that makes him the most money? It just doesn't make sense why he would violate hit terms and not just try to find a way out that wouldn't get him in legal troubles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABelgianWaffle_ @TheSwordmouse Why would he sign a new deal knowing that he was going to start streaming on another platform? Also, why would he go to Facebook or Youtube when they are clearly not up to Twitch levels as far as revenue goes? Not saying those platforms aren't good, but clearly Twitch (1/2)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABelgianWaffle_ @TheSwordmouse How would he have a new deal with a different platform when he signed a multi year deal recently with twitch? That makes absolutely zero sense. That would be him breaching his contract.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GigglyApple It's not concerning. I wait for all the facts to go off on something. The fact people don't, and are so quick to judge or stick up for someone is concerning. But whatever helps you cope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GigglyApple They could have possibly known about this ahead of time. To us it looks spontaneous. To them it could have been a couple weeks of getting the ball moving on actions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GigglyApple They don't have to disclose anything to us. They aren't obligated whatsoever. Not to mention, if it's serious, they probably legally cannot discuss things. It's not always that cut and dry and people need to understand that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bwrightleft @Nilla_dk @CletusBueford @drdisrespect The second he got on stream and told everyone, is the second is stopped being his private life. Did you ever consider that?

<|startoftext|>@D_wayneWhite @ARTMANWAN @chrisledgering @Foostini @_Delemere_ @exzeyy It's also ILLEGAL and he could have been charged for it.

<|startoftext|>Assaulted and them wanting justice is "bullying" and "smol pp culture". If these successful people don't want their lives ruined, maybe they shouldn't ruin other peoples lives by doing what they did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry, but this is a terrible take. It's not cancel culture holding people accountable. People who prey on women and children and sexually harrass or assault anyone deserves the heat. It's not "bullying" and it's not "smoll pp culture". I'm sorry you feel someone being sexually  https://t.co/MZfdidWRlv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BriannicusG So the people who they hurt should just accept that someone has "changed" and move on too? Also, plenty of these people who have said to change, have been outted to continuing behaviors. I don't consider it bullying at all. You do stupid shit like that, you deserve the heat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BriannicusG It's not cancel culture. It's "Holding people accountable" culture. If someone is going to prey on underage girls, groom etc, they deserve to be hd accountable and to deal with the consequences of their actions. I don't understand how this can't be understood.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CraigyGCool @shroud What don't you understand about your own argument? You claim to not have the money to buy a PC but admit to buying an Xbox one X and peripherals/accessories....

<|startoftext|>@KeepLookingUp6 @Debra4KAG @NotALiberal1991 There's a major difference between talking about it, and actually doing.

<|startoftext|>Yes, and that still stands true. What is this post supposed to even do? Show hypocrisy? Because if that's the case, you're wrong. Police are here to protect and serve, please say it with me; PROTECT and SERVE. Of course when they murder someone unjustly we are going to (1/2)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeepLookingUp6 @Debra4KAG @NotALiberal1991 Nobody wants to "do away with police", stop spreading misinformation. They want REFORM. You're so ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bgrange43138660 @Debra4KAG @LoysaZ How is that contradicting themselves? Police ARE there to PROTECT and to SERVE. Not to kill unarmed people. So of course when a police officer who is sworn in to again, protect and serve, murders someone unjustly, we need to hold them accountable.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Beegirl68651492 @patriot17871 @AndTheMeltdowns @GovNedLamont The issue here is the police have too much power. Why do towns and cities need tanks and military weapons? If a situation is escalated to that point, that is why we have the national guard.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DawnMarieSaid @AndTheMeltdowns @patriot17871 @GovNedLamont That wasn't an insult, it was a legitimate question as time and time again you keep saying we are saying there should be no police and we are saying reform.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DawnMarieSaid @AndTheMeltdowns @patriot17871 @GovNedLamont No one said to have "no police". The argument is police REFORM. Do you know what that word means?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DawnMarieSaid @AndTheMeltdowns @patriot17871 @GovNedLamont You are so clueless and too busy throwing around things that Donald Trump says, you don't even want to learn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawnMarieSaid @AndTheMeltdowns @patriot17871 @GovNedLamont Excuse me? I haven't committed a single crime in my entire life. I don't even have a speeding ticket.

<|startoftext|>@AndTheMeltdowns @patriot17871 @GovNedLamont Republicans are perfectly fine with people of color being murdered in the streets, at least most conservatives are. It's honestly disgusting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndTheMeltdowns @patriot17871 @GovNedLamont Of course they are. Because Republicans don't see the issue and never will, especially with someone like Donald Trump in office who basically supports this kind of behavior. We shouldn't be living in a world where police have this kind of power and aren't held accountable.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hotnspicy_jo @TravStever Of course it doesn't. Social media doesn't save lives. But social media is only part of it all. Social media is good for certain things.  You can only protest to a certain degree on social media, which is why it's important to protest on the streets. Donate to the causes etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hotnspicy_jo @TravStever You too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hotnspicy_jo @TravStever There are many ways to help support. Wether it be signing petitions, donating the causes regarding this movement or by doing things on social media.   Wether it "does nothing" or not, it's nice to see those with a platform condemning and participating in the movement.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@directedbyrian There's many ways to show support. Putting down anyone/any way of doing that is not a good take.   Not everyone can go out to these protests either due to health or other reasons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's happening even still during protests. These cops are out of control.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cowards cops. Coward President.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stopcrying911 @BrodieBurner @LethalShooter__ So because a black officer did it, it's no longer police brutality?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stopcrying911 @BrodieBurner @LethalShooter__ And?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Weswells6 @BriannicusG 5 to 10? I disagree. At the rate of killings over the years, we will be back here within 6 months without some sort of accountability.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrodieBurner @LethalShooter__ What's your point?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RamarakTV @BriannicusG This is what I understand too, and from what I've seen, alot of it is a bunch of white people coming in, destroying a bunch of stuff and then ducking out trying to blame the peaceful protestors which in turn pisses everyone else off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BriannicusG If there's always another way I would love to hear your opinion on what that is, because so far peaceful protests haven't gotten the message across time and time again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BriannicusG Ducking*  Then trying to blame it on black people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BriannicusG Again, back to my point, there are outside groups coming to destroy things and then leaving after the match has been lit. Protestors have yelled at these other groups to stop. Oddly enough, plenty of videos of a bunch of white dudes breaking things and then fucking trying to<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BriannicusG Because these protests were peaceful until the police marched in with dirty tactics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BriannicusG They are arresting reporters and shooting pepper paint balls at them for no reason. There's so much going on with these cops and yet people are blind to it. You say violence isn't the answer, then hold the police accountable as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BriannicusG No matter what they do, it's not good enough for anyone. It's honestly sickening. We have cops in NY using their vehicles as battering rams. Cops are shoving innocent protestors to the ground and pepper spraying them unjustifiably.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BriannicusG In that same breathe, how many peaceful protests do they need to have before they are heard? How many Colin Kaepernicks have to use their platform and be called traitors and un-merican?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BriannicusG What people don't realize, and what the media isn't focusing on is that these rioters are outsiders coming in, they're opportunists, who are there smearing the movement. Most of, if not all, of these protests have been peaceful. Have we not learned anything about grouping people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You will never see @realDonaldTrump out in the streets getting down on one knee in a sign of solidarity. The man is full of hatred.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@p1mpweasel @TwitchPrime If everyone got it, we wouldn't be seeing cops killing unarmed black men, would we? We wouldn't see blacks being targeted.   No, not everyone gets it, and this response is part of the problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All the people saying children shouldn't be there need to understand that this childs future is not far off. This child deserves to be able to fight along side her parent(s). It was peaceful, therefore shouldn't be an issue. But then cops decided to use dirty tactics.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Patriots Edelman is the last man standing. Won't be shocked to see him gone soon too. A true rebuild is here. But I'm excited to see what Stidham can do, and I swear if the Patriots make Brian Hoyer the starter I'm gonna lose it üòÇ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@versace_wayne @RlPJxyzvh @Drag0nFragz @Patriots I have high hopes for Stidham and N'keal. Stidham was actually a decent QB in college and everyone wants to base him on one drive when he came in for Brady and threw a pick 6; but I'm gonna chalk it up to nerves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@versace_wayne @RlPJxyzvh @Drag0nFragz @Patriots The Pats offense definitely wasn't what it used to be. Edelman was banged up all season, the shit with Brown and then Gordon.

<|startoftext|>@ZoeCatfu @Timmac_ I don't think it's that. I think it's the hypocrisy within twitch. People get banned for far less things that go against TOS.

<|startoftext|>that are equivalent to a second graders mindset. It's honestly sad to see.

<|startoftext|>@samcambolt0270 @Whomsky @OfficialPCMR Because when I used it, I had problems. I had been Intel most of my gaming life until I tried AMD. Didn't work out, so I went back to what I knew. Plain and simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rsgladwin85 @Whomsky @OfficialPCMR It's not your money, so I guess you shouldn't worry about it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rsgladwin85 @Whomsky @OfficialPCMR When I used AMD it's heating/cooling sucked. Ran into many issues with it. That's my reason. It wasnt my set up, either. My air flow was good. My water cooling was fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rsgladwin85 @Whomsky @OfficialPCMR You want reasons? Which I don't actually need to explain myself to you, to be fair. I never stated anything other than I wasn't a fan of them.

<|startoftext|>@samcambolt0270 @Whomsky @OfficialPCMR Because I like what I've used? And don't like what I've used? I tried both and prefer the other. I don't know what else to tell you people. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The people didn't want a politician, and that's the only reason he won. People were fed up with politics and he used that to his advantage. Trump said he loves the uneducated, and he made a fool out of a lot of people.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Imagine it because it's a real thing. This man. We would love to rid the world of bullying and though, we know it's impossible to rid the entire world, it's even harder when you have people like this who downright support it. It's a snowball effect.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's sick that a post about bullying turn into this, and all these sick people got from this was that he's faking it, and is actually 18 and he just wants "free stuff". That's really what we got from this? This is why people don't come forward about bullying it anything else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because he has no e clothes and his family has money it disqualifies him from being bullied?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact people are arguing over whether #quadenbayles is 9 or 18 is disturbing. A post made about bullying quickly turned into people trying to discredit what was shown because of pictures on Instagram and him having nice clothes. Are you FUCKING A KIDDING ME?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@guin_waite @rosaluxemburg22 @Alyssa_Milano Which says he is 8 years old.   Also, because he is a child actor means he can't be bullied in the real world? That excludes him and makes it so that this is fake?  Amazing how people are quick to dismiss things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Flakbeard_ @WWEREALONE Turn what around? Clearly you don't have access to those files. So what, do you really expect me to believe some random dude on Twitter to have access to that?  You didn't understand sarcasm. If still like proof though.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Flakbeard_ @nyymz @rosaluxemburg22 @Alyssa_Milano @GMA Again, you're stalling. You've literally got nothing, I get it.   All bark, no bite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Flakbeard_ @nyymz @rosaluxemburg22 @Alyssa_Milano @GMA Anyone can type letters and say "facts" or "proof". Show me evidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Flakbeard_ @nyymz @rosaluxemburg22 @Alyssa_Milano @GMA You said something....that's not proof.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Flakbeard_ @nyymz @rosaluxemburg22 @Alyssa_Milano @GMA It is sad. You can't back anything up with evidence so you run away with a cop out reply.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Flakbeard_ @nyymz @rosaluxemburg22 @Alyssa_Milano So prove it then. You're the one making accusations. Do what nobody wants to do and actually prove your argument.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Flakbeard_ @nyymz @rosaluxemburg22 @Alyssa_Milano @GMA I didn't think so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nyymz @Flakbeard_ @rosaluxemburg22 @Alyssa_Milano @GMA Pictures of this kid's life doesn't prove anything. Again, the mother never said they were broke. She said he was bullied.  We get it, you're 42 and he wears better clothes than you. Again, doesn't prove anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Flakbeard_ @nyymz @rosaluxemburg22 @Alyssa_Milano Go ahead, get his birth certificate, his files etc. I'll wait.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Flakbeard_ @nyymz @rosaluxemburg22 @Alyssa_Milano Prove it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nyymz @rosaluxemburg22 @Alyssa_Milano That's cool. Don't really care. Try saying something that actually triggers me next time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nyymz @rosaluxemburg22 @Alyssa_Milano It proves nothing. Money &amp; clothes doesn't stop bullying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rosaluxemburg22 @Alyssa_Milano Also there's an article that states he's had an early fascination with money. Hell, if our USD was that colorful, I would too as a kid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rosaluxemburg22 @Alyssa_Milano Mother never said they were broke. She said he was being bullied. This literally proves nothing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cbowersesq @Vanessa_29 @BoostIdol80 @iamwandasykes @realDonaldTrump Then maybe you need to get a higher class ticket with more space.

<|startoftext|>@RobertStorms84 @andysignore The fact is, this isn't the only thing you've said in the past. There's a whole video dedicated to all the fucked up shit you've said. Wether someone "told you to act crazy" or it's "an old channel", you're still going on tirades.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertStorms84 @andysignore "This person told me to do something"  So if someone said jump off a bridge you'd do that too? Honestly, the passing off to other people is honestly so stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andysignore @RobertStorms84 No, this is definitely him (tattoos are extra proof). And it's only the tip of the iceberg with this guy. He doesn't deserve the extended spotlight. He's a hateful person, and all this excuse making he does to save face is honestly disturbing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andysignore Are you this dense? The video attached to my comment. But I'm guessing you also condone those types of actions, so why am I surprised?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andysignore Clearly you haven't watched the video I supplied you. Clearly you ignored 90% of what he's said in his video.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andysignore It really has nothing to do with agreeing or disagreeing. You're giving someone who has the history he does, the actions he does and the disgusting language he a does an extended spotlight. Outright condoning his actions with a copout excuse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andysignore Then you're just as bad as him. Especially since he continues his disgusting behavior.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't worry. You'll be out soon.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SeahawkDaddy @JOSH_GORDONXII Yes, he sure does. However, it's a bit selfish as a fan to hope for his return when he's clearly nowhere ready to do so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeahawkDaddy @JOSH_GORDONXII Dude. Why do sports fans always do that? Let this man get himself right and get his life together. Instead of wishing he returns to football, why not wish him well with his journey to recovery first?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Hsali23 @killumi50150718 But again, that's me, you are welcome to your own opinion. Have a good one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hsali23 @killumi50150718 A "fa**ot" and bleeped it out in an updated version because he knew he was wrong. So its not like the guy hasn't shown that he can do it. Which is why I wish he would just grow up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hsali23 @killumi50150718 It's not "you love him or hate his guts". There IS an in-between where you wish better from someone who you enjoyed listening to their music. You can still be a fan but also critique. Not sure if you knew that. If not, now you do. Also, Eminem called Tyler the Creator<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hsali23 @killumi50150718 Eminem gets credit for everything he's accomplished in life as an MC. There's no doubt he's one of the best freestyle rappers and rappers in general. I just think he metaphorically needs to grow up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hsali23 @killumi50150718 I think it's time others have as well, but again, that's just me. I'm not trashing the guy, just stating how I feel and agreeing with someone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hsali23 @killumi50150718 I wasn't doing anything to make him look bad. My single opinion isn't going to change the outlook on Eminem by any means. But you also don't need to be a complete White Knight for the guy. I've grown up, my vocabulary has changed, my thoughts have changed etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalawayJosh @Hsali23 @killumi50150718 This is a post about Eminem, not rap in general. The rest of that is a discussion for a different day. But don't bring other shit into a different conversation. Stay on topic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalawayJosh @Hsali23 @killumi50150718 When did I say that? You're pulling words out of your ass and saying I said that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hsali23 @killumi50150718 My point is, it's 2020, and shit like that shouldn't fly. But hey, I guess I just don't like his music because I have a different view than you.   Gtfo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hsali23 @killumi50150718 I've listened to Eminem since  before high school, my guy. I'm 31. Just because "all rappers say something.cringe worthy" doesn't make it any less different to me. Also saying "just say you don't like his music" anytime there's an opposing view is annoying from you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hsali23 @killumi50150718 It's not that his music isnt good. But a 47 year old in 2020 still using terms like "retard" and others is cringe worthy.   Inb4 ("Oh you people are so sensitive"). Nah, this dude's opinion is relevant.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KeishaSays_ It's not a "people who celebrate this tell one another this". Because clearly if that was a fact, this conversation and your clearly triggered comment wouldn't be needed. Why don't you just accept people's Happy Holiday like you expect people to use merry Christmas or that's it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeishaSays_ @drboycewatkins1 @indiaarie Opinion stays the same. Also, you should worry about what you do with your kids and not how others deal with their children/relationship with them. Also, let's not judge people we don't know.

<|startoftext|>@KeishaSays_ It's not people being sensitive. Some people legit don't celebrate Christmas. So saying "happy holidays" instead is out of respect for those who don't, like Jewish families. But expecting people to understand that or even think about that aspect is asking too much.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KeishaSays_ @drboycewatkins1 @indiaarie Who am I to judge what people do in their lives? If it makes them money and allows them to pay their bills without being a menace to society?

<|startoftext|>Apparently the new star wars movie was the worst thing in movie history, yet still had a better ending, plot and character development than the entire final season of Game of Thrones.  (PS, star wars wasn't that bad.)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Getting worse than the Fast and Furious franchise. Who asked for this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Daley_Kong It sucks, Im just now starting to get over the flu. I had it for 5 days or so before symptoms started calming down :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's literally a movie about Jedis and siths, creatures that don't exist, powers that don't exist and you all get so hung up on the "impossible"? Whatever. Rise of Skywalker was entertaining, and that's what counts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These movies were for a new generation of fans. That was always known. I loved the original trilogy just as much as anyone else, but I can also sit back, relax and enjoy an entirely different space adventure. Stop thinking about it so hard. Stop trying to make sense of EVERYTHING<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So very sorry you didn't get as much Luke Skywalker as you wanted in The force awakens. Then, you get Luke Skywalker in the last Jedi and it's not good enough because he's not actually there. He is, or was, but still not enough for you so it's a terrible movie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly there's no worse fan than the "original trilogy is the only trilogy" fan. Those are literally edgy fan boys who act like nothing else can be liked because it doesn't focus on the old characters and they haven't gotten over that fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thoroughly enjoyed #RiseofSkywalker   Good send off to the series.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thesistakaren @Dat360NoScope @Sebastien_VN @Victory16871351 @octobies Her mods were apparently getting hate messages.

<|startoftext|>@thesistakaren @Sebastien_VN @Dat360NoScope @Victory16871351 @octobies Because when someone says things like this before an apology you figure she's now only saying it because she's getting so much backlash and wants her Twitter to stop blowing up.

<|startoftext|>@DragonsTacet It shouldn't be an option to ignore it. That's the problem with a lot of people. Wether on the internet or in real life.

<|startoftext|>Do better at seeing the other side of the tracks and why it hurts people. I know the internet is a lost cause, because it's often times filled with more hate than positive people. But we need to do better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't care who you are, what you have or don't have. People deserve to be able to live their life without being mocked for something they can't control. "I have this, I wouldn't care" is not a good enough answer. As a society we need to do better. Get better at understanding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timthetatman pick better mods please. Gotta love how saying you shouldn't make jokes about disabilities is considered overly sensitive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bronxbomber19 @luckedrew @lucipherion @octobies You not being overly sensitive about it doesn't make it right. You are but one person in a massive sea of people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bronxbomber19 @luckedrew @lucipherion @octobies Rather than be made fun of, or have someone take something like that so lightly they use it as a punch line.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bronxbomber19 @luckedrew @lucipherion @octobies Comedy in 2019 isn't dead. People just don't want to have something they can't control mocked in 2019. There's nothing funny about disabilities.   The fact it's being labeled sensitive is sad. God forbid people want to live a life and feel like they fit in to society<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@octobies The fact that you call it "fun" and the fact you only took it down because mods were getting hate messages is pretty sad. You're a terrible person if you have to use disabilities as a punch line. Not even a little bit of remorse for something a decent person would have some for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Deafgirl_gaming @octobies Then so be it. I don't use disabilities as a punchline, so my conscious is clear. Thanks though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Deafgirl_gaming @octobies Hm, let's see.  Uses disability as a punchline: asshole thing to do  Not using disabilities as a punchline: not an asshole thing to do  Seems legit to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Deafgirl_gaming @octobies Yes, because commenting under the wrong "section" of a Twitter post is exactly the same as someone using a disability as a punch line. üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Deafgirl_gaming @octobies It's a continuation of the thread, either way. Comment stands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Deafgirl_gaming @octobies Not using your words. Using MY words and my opinion that anyone who needs to use a disability as a joke is indeed an asshole.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Classy.   But you did manage to get something right in this. Trump is a maniac, and he's an evil person. So I guess thank you for confirming things that we already knew.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nachoghost @Sleeper4321 @DeathStranding_ Like I said, it's a different experience when you're actually playing it, and constantly having to adjust your weight or avoid BT's.

If you don't like the game, fine, but move on and stop going into death stranding posts to stir the shit pot. You wonder why you get jumped on, because you're purposely shitting<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@timthetatman You're gonna hate it later....  L.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pizzastevebaby You also came at someone else who said they enjoyed the game. You said anyone who tried to say the gameplay was good was high....how is that any different? You're on a death Stranding post bashing people for liking the game....can you see the hypocritical aspect you're giving?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pizzastevebaby @JoshMcCage @DeathStranding_ Wasn't referring to the walking. It was in response to the gameplay. That and the terrible deeds of bungie. They treated their fanbase like garbage. So much so they needed to make it free to play to make it up to them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adarsh91395672 @thechrisdenker No problem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pizzastevebaby @JoshMcCage @DeathStranding_ So is Destiny ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pizzastevebaby And that's great, I never said you couldn't hate a game. This was never about you until you went on and on about it. This was about the original poster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pizzastevebaby @JoshMcCage @DeathStranding_ That's a personal problem, not the games problem. It's too complex for you, so it seems. But that's not the games fault.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pizzastevebaby Appreciate the shout-out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adarsh91395672 @thechrisdenker Do you enjoy dark souls? That's what it's like. I literally can't compare the two. One is open world wild wild west, the other is linear sci-fi.  They are both great in their own ways.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pizzastevebaby @lady_sneakles Far from a fan boy as I didn't bother playing most of the metal gear solids after the PS1/PS2.   But hey, nice assumption. Idiots really do be out here don't they.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pizzastevebaby @lady_sneakles If he had played the game for 10+ hours it might be a different story. But he didn't, and he admits he didn't. You can't form a solid opinion of a game this complex in one hour. You can't. So leave your shit at someone else's door.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pizzastevebaby @DeathStranding_ There's also no reason to comment "Nope I returned it" either. If you don't like a game, cool, you're allowed to not like something. But if that's the case, go about your life. He didn't even add any constructive criticism. He was just being an edgelord.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pizzastevebaby @DeathStranding_ Kind of surprised honestly. Most base PS4s have been buggy and even experience loading in the middle of doing things. Consider yourself lucky I guess.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DeathStranding_ I'm actually enjoying star wars for what it is. This person must be on a base console, because I haven't gotten many glitches on the Pro. I probably should of gotten it on PC though. Soon as I beat star wars I'm back on that death Stranding grind.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gijoe0414 @DeathStranding_ I'm not even sure it's an official account, but regardless, lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uHateToSeeIt69 Of course it's in the bio, it's a second account that I used specifically for this, lmao.   Ah, yes, in denial that I'm a bum. Again, very clever. You haven't said one thing that has proved to me that you're not a child. So why am I going to be offended by you? Good try, again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uHateToSeeIt69 If that was shitting on my life, get good. That was pretty garbage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uHateToSeeIt69 Meh. I don't play fortnite. I like actual video games, thanks though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uHateToSeeIt69 And yes, I did tell you to grow up, because clearly you haven't. Your comments have proved my point over and over so far.   You keep throwing insults about twitch at me as if that's supposed to crush my spirits for something I rarely do in the first place.   Again, grow up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uHateToSeeIt69 Ah yes...pussy. Something you've probably never seen up close. I could tell you about it some day. Maybe when you're old enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uHateToSeeIt69 Oh yes, now comes how much money you make, yadda yadda as if I'm supposed to be threatened by someone on the internet throwing figures he probably couldn't even comprehend at me. Clever, and a decent try. But I've seen better.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@uHateToSeeIt69 @barnaby8787 @KrisInRVA @paula_politics @alexi @daveweigel I don't recall saying I was targeted. Again, what a rebuttal that was. As if that's never been said in the existence of human life. Nice try, though. Really proving my point, bravo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By the way, I was stopped while I took this. Exit ended up being backed up. Either way, I hate people like this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@uHateToSeeIt69 @barnaby8787 @KrisInRVA @paula_politics @alexi @daveweigel Wow, big insults as if I really about being an "unknown twitch gamer". Oh and also the "get a job" attack. Oh my. You certainly are whimsical aren't you? I'm so very hurt, what am I ever to do now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is wrong with people....  Oh right, a bunch of old white rich guys...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tekkwene @CHSpolitico @alexi Or maybe calling out stupid behavior on a platform that you have is just as good. Cops would ask if physicality was involved. No? Ok well we can't do anything about it.   Also, who are you to tell someone how to handle something? Everyone has different ways of dealing/coping.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexLowther2014 @DeathStranding_ I also don't see a point in this person responding to a post asking about your favorite character. If he barely played the game and got bored and bought something else, why even comment to tell us that? At that point just move on. Make him seem like he's just trying to be edgy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@eurekafresh_ @mattydRKO @DeathStranding_ You can't say that people don't necessarily have the time but then throw in that they watch streamers play an entire game.

<|startoftext|>@sdwind125 @HumbleReilly @youngtracie1 @ZackBornstein He is. And I'm sorry you and your child had to go through that, I'm glad everything turned out ok in the end.

<|startoftext|>@HumbleReilly @youngtracie1 @sdwind125 @ZackBornstein You're judging someone based off their texts, when I'm pretty sure the father would rather his child be trying to get safe than constantly checking a phone.

<|startoftext|>@ember75 @pizziosoda @DeathStranding_ @Dansgaming @Jack_Septic_Eye @Sony You desiring to not own a console is not a companies fault.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ember75 @pizziosoda @DeathStranding_ @Dansgaming @Jack_Septic_Eye @Sony And it's not bad business to have exclusives. It's actually what helps sell your consoles. "oh man last of us is only on PlayStation? I have an Xbox, guess I need to buy a PS4". How is that bad business? It's a reason I own a Xbox, PS4 and built a PC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ember75 @pizziosoda @DeathStranding_ @Dansgaming @Jack_Septic_Eye @Sony I'm not watching a video, I just think it's ridiculous you claim that magic would be lost for something, but willingly go out of your way to watch a game before you can even play it. There's people on PC who stayed away from Red Dead 2 entirely so they wouldn't be spoiled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ember75 @pizziosoda @DeathStranding_ @Dansgaming @Jack_Septic_Eye @Sony Why would you watch people play through the game only to complain that the magic would be lost? Really seems like you're just complaining to complain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ember75 @DeathStranding_ @Dansgaming @Jack_Septic_Eye @Sony You are in the minority of people turned off by this. I don't see many people complaining that they have to wait til the summer to play this game. No one is getting shafted here. Be grateful they're even porting it to PC in the first place since it was a Sony exclusive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just installed Disney+ and I'm like a kid in a candy shop. Can't wait to dive into some shows in the next few days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ember75 @DeathStranding_ @Dansgaming @Jack_Septic_Eye @Sony Also, it's not double dipping it's porting something over to PC which takes a bit more time, especially with games like they are today. Rather them get it right and take time to do so than rush it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ember75 @DeathStranding_ @Dansgaming @Jack_Septic_Eye @Sony How would it lose its magic by then? People on PC waited for red Dead 2 and it's hit a new wave of popularity again. What are you talking about?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#DeathStranding is an interesting game for sure. The story so far has me extremely intrigued and I don't even mind being an "Amazon delivery man" as most of the haters have called it.

<|startoftext|>@johnnybrazyyy @AdamSchefter @Patriots Josh Gordon, Phillip Dorsett and Julian Edelman have it covered I think. The only issue is staying healthy. It's a long season.

<|startoftext|>@johnnybrazyyy @AdamSchefter @Patriots Why? We don't need him. Sure he's a great player, but the outside distractions and the noise that he created is not "the Patriots way". The guy can't keep his mouth shut or his social media and can't stop doing stupid things.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Eye_sixx @SonyPictures Into the spiderverse was a great step forward, even if it was animated. Sony will do just fine, especially considering the writers from the Spiderman movies marvel did are writing for Sony. It is what it is. Disney is at fault. They could have kept the original agreement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eye_sixx @SonyPictures Regardless, Disney is being greedy and was lucky to have him for as long as they did. Everyone is upset with Sony in this situation, but they should be mad at Disney.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eye_sixx @SonyPictures Marvel sold it when they were going bankrupt years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eye_sixx @SonyPictures Sony absolutely DOES own the intellectual property.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eye_sixx @SonyPictures Spend*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eye_sixx @SonyPictures Disney also didn't spent the money to MAKE those movies. SONY produced and paid for all of that, so they SHOULD get the money. 50/50 is Disney being greedy for something they don't OWN. Would you do a 50/50 split for a property you own and paid for everything? Doubt it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBoyFruit Love it. This may be a stupid question, but do you have a brush set to download or what kind of brushes/settings do you use?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eye_sixx @SonyPictures Tom Holland will still be Spiderman and that's all that matters. Maybe Disney should stop being power hungry and greedy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eye_sixx @SonyPictures I mean.....SONY literally paid for every Spiderman movie. They own the rights, they dished out the funding. All marvel did was write and direct and collect merchandise sales. I don't see how this is SONYs fault at all. Disney owns too much and wanted a ridiculous amount.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NearyXCIV @CletusBueford @Twitch But we also shouldnt just roll over and accept the terrible things that are happening either. If we silence ourselves for the sake of everyone else's positivity, nothing gets done.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wait, so now you guys want to decide what content is shown on our channels while they are offline? That doesn't seem cool at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RettSaiah @UPSHelp Apparently not because it's been over 2hrs since I've dm'ed them and not a single response. If you're a support page, I expect at least SOME support or a message saying they will get back to me asap.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JW_Evolution We need some bridges, man. That's what we need. I wish this game was more like planet coaster with the amount of customization. Makes me sad. But this is beautiful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Then you have twitch being petty and using Ninjas channel as an advertisement base recommending porn for two hours because twitch can't get their shit together. This is becoming a massive mess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't support people who don't care about animal abuse. I can't support a company who bans one person for something, but completely ignores actions of someone else deserving a ban.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After the recent attitude of @Twitch, or should I say the lack of caring, I'm honestly debating on a move to a different platform.   It's a shame, some of my favorite streamers are on Twitch. I watch them every chance I get. But I honestly don't think I can support twitch anymore<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LegendaryEnergy Dude, you need to stop taking things and spinning them. He's using hell as an analogy.

<|startoftext|>@EAHelp C'mon guys....I'm a PC gamer. You don't think I've tried these common steps already?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EAHelp The only thing that seems to fix it is playing in window mode. But I don't like doing that, and it's not a great solution. This needs to be addressed asap. We aren't the only ones going through this. And I'm not even sure if window mode was a fluke or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EAHelp @ChompyDesigns Why can't you just look into the problem regardless of how many people it's happening too? Just fix your game...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChompyDesigns @EAHelp Having the same issue. Makes the game virtually unplayable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlinityTwitch @KEEMSTAR So now you're trying to avoid being the bad guy after you abused your animals? That's low dude.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EAMaddenNFL seriously, every game I play on PC the lines for kickoffs, preplay etc all disappear and makes this game unplayable. FIX IT. @EAHelp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh also,  @EAMaddenNFL, it's so great when all the icons and UI disappears in the middle of a game. Great job EA. #madden20<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Oh shut up. Go do some presidential work or something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still absolutely nothing by @twitch on the animal abuse issue. Where are you guys? Not even a statement that you're investigating? Nothing? So you'll ban people for hitting their girlfriend off camera, filming in a bathroom and many other offenses but abusing animals isn't one?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlinityTwitch @SaskatoonSPCA You are a terrible example of someone who should be on this platform and someone who should be a pet owner. These animals deserve much better. Please give them to the SPCA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlinityTwitch @SaskatoonSPCA Twitch needs to ban you for what you did. There is absolutely zero excuse for throwing your cat, kicking your dog or spitting vodka  in your cats mouth which is mighty poisonous to cats and dogs by the way....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlinityTwitch @SaskatoonSPCA You should feel like a terrible person for that. Honestly, for your animals sake, I hope they find they are in good health. But that doesn't mean anyone should ever trust you again with the things you've done past and present to them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlinityTwitch @SaskatoonSPCA Yeah, posting pictures to try and make yourself look like a great per owner isn't going to help people. Plus, you didn't call them, they already were gonna start an investigation on YOU. So don't try and act like you're the good guy here. You mistreated your animals...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SoNutz86 You need to not focus so much on that, and focus on your journey, your fundme and the things in your life. Doing that is only going to hurt you more than it is helping you.

<|startoftext|>@misskayheart Like you're leaving out a lot of shit that was said from both of you. And you know you are. So don't paint a false picture as if he's making him out to be a victim when he's not yadda yadda. You both are victims in this, you both screwed up, you both said hurtful things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@misskayheart What he said wasn't right in this picture. But you BOTH said fucked up things to each other. BOTH OF YOU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@misskayheart You can be upset about what he said, and how he feels about you, but why go out of your way to try and prove all of this when it's OVER? This is all childish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@misskayheart And you're not living your life, because if you were you wouldn't be on here posting these pictures the way you are. If you had him removed, you would have never of seen his feelings on Twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@misskayheart And you're still going out of your way how long later to go for the throat because he's expressing how he saw the relationship. You did the same thing! You were in your discord, on Twitter telling everyone how shitty he was. So how is what he said on juturnas thread different?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@misskayheart You BOTH did some fucked up things to each other and were EXTREMELY toxic in that relationship at one time or another. You are no saint either.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MrTrumpeteer711 @thetitaniumtutu @MsClark317 @heckie67 @Smeloniew1970 @SocialPowerOne1 I don't care how much outside stuff you pick up, or if your kids hide how they act while in the home, someone is always watching. Someone will know. That's a lazy excuse you're giving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrTrumpeteer711 @thetitaniumtutu @MsClark317 @heckie67 @Smeloniew1970 @SocialPowerOne1 I'm not really sure why we are giving excuses here. Point blank, if more parents owned up and actually watched what their child did more, exercise more discipline, a lot of things could be avoided. Instead, parents just let the TV raise their kids etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrTrumpeteer711 @thetitaniumtutu @MsClark317 @heckie67 @Smeloniew1970 @SocialPowerOne1 Because in today's world with social media, cameras etc, anything can be found out. You may not act a certain way, but I guarantee if a child is acting up outside the home, eventually it's going to show. Kids are disrespectful to their parents all the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetitaniumtutu @MsClark317 @heckie67 @Smeloniew1970 @SocialPowerOne1 Ok, way to stay on topic though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thetitaniumtutu @MsClark317 @heckie67 @Smeloniew1970 @SocialPowerOne1 Yes, and what kids pick up outside should be rectified by the parents teaching these values. When the parents don't, the kids continue with the things learned outside. So it still falls on the parents. People need to stop passing blame.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The sniping in this game kind of triggers me. These kids dont even learn the mechanics of the game, they just use snipers up close. They called me shit, so we 1 v 1'ed, they all lost.

<|startoftext|>@islandmob662 @HEYYYYKP That's because most of the people giving this movie bad reviews didn't like the jabs about America loving their guns too much and tyrants as president. Too much butthurt people who can't handle jokes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Seanaci This game was made for PVP, this was obvious from the start. If you don't like the PVP I suggest finding a different game. Because making separate servers for PVE and PVP would completely ruin the point of this game.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Was having issues with a cable to get audio from my PS4 controller into my mixer so I ordered a new one.

<|startoftext|>Good time to rank up heroes. Guess I gotta play more Battlefront 2 today lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenWalke so how do we go about getting racist trolls banned from the Battlefront community/game, because it seems reporting it in game does nothing. Sad thing about this game is you usually run into the same people. Also "turn off chat" shouldnt be an answer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will be trying to get an hour or two of stream in today maybe at some point. Will try not to rage, even though at this point it's sort of my shtick' as they say. But it really isn't healthy from a mental standpoint and I'm working on it, lol. Damn FPS games.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yoooo that @machinegunkelly diss by @Eminem, RIP, MGK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eminem is back! Dropped a surprise album and this ish is fire! I haven't liked his last few albums as much as his earlier stuff. But something about Kamikaze. Not to mention the subtle Like Yachty diss lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can we PLEASE get rid of toxic, racist, pos's like this? All this guy does is spew racist garbage. PLEASE get rid of people like this. @EAHelp @EAStarWars @EA_DICE @DICE_FireWall #Battlefront2  https://t.co/taPrkGkdBI<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MechanicDave_ I know. Just waiting for Spiderman and Shadow of the tomb raider. Hopefully that can get me back in the game. I just need something new. Plus, there's hardly anyone around to play with anymore. Lonely gaming ftw. Should change my name to that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just feel like I can never have fun playing video games anymore. Really sucks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GCGUneeke Yeah, the crew was definitely one of those. I barely touched either one. But hopefully with Spiderman the story makes up for it. I'm hearing 20hr completion time with just main stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GCGUneeke My concerns are nit-picky things. Like New York actually feeling alive, and the city not feeling like just some "space". I want that atmosphere. I hate games that have large cities, but everything just feels empty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GCGUneeke Same here, it looks really good. I have a few concerns, but they're minimal at this point.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Unicorn_Shield Awesome job!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Esoluu I was excited to maybe see you get back into that game, sadly I don't see that happening now. I also want to cry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Esoluu Seems to be most people's reaction.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Unicorn_Shield I like my pistol, especially now since skellies carry barrels, but I like the blundy for boarding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've gone and put myself through¬† This for the very last time I'm not gonna punish myself¬† When I know that the fault is not mine It's on my skin Your scent is poison when I breathe you in   https://t.co/QoOeIXiQgG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/6RbQwadLFq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Am I the only one that's not bothered that the blunderbuss doesn't 1 tap anyone anymore? Because I see a lot of complaining. Which is funny, because when the game first came out it was nothing but complaints that it DID one tap. So which is it? #SeaOfThieves #BeMorePirate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Unicorn_Shield Haha that tongue tho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thefroste @CameronGotay @RareLtd @SeaOfThieves @greatNpowerfulM Absolutely, it's my favorite game. I've been apart since the beginning with Alpha and still can't stop playing it lol. On my quest for Pirate Legend at 45-44-42. If I didn't have a job I'd be on this 24/7, lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thefroste @CameronGotay @RareLtd @SeaOfThieves @greatNpowerfulM Yep. I've gone around finding low level people before and have given them captains chests etc. Then one day was going around doing that and got a barrel to the bottom of my boat for my kindness, wasn't able to make it back and sunk with the rest of the loot out in the ocean.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thefroste @CameronGotay @RareLtd @SeaOfThieves @greatNpowerfulM Yeah, you're one of the few who apparently think that way. Others just wanna approach you without saying anything, and then when they meet my blundy to their face call me an asshole because I killed them on my ship. You can't trust pirates.  https://t.co/mFo2w7o3n8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CameronGotay @thefroste @RareLtd @SeaOfThieves @greatNpowerfulM I mean, it's not really a shame, since it's a pirate game, and that's what pirates do, but I hear ya. I have a hard time trusting people for this reason. So we no longer ask questions first.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BrokenShipwreck @UnicornJessa Likely be a permanent fixture in the game along with the other things that they add in. Sorry you don't feel like theres anything to do but it's subjective. I've put in hundreds of hours so far, which to me is replayability.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrokenShipwreck @UnicornJessa I do enjoy grinding Athena missions. I enjoy sailing around. I enjoy combat. I enjoy skull forts. I enjoy everything the game offers and enjoy going around just sailing. I'm sorry you feel the way you do. As far as the new dlc, the content remains. The shark will now more than<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnicornJessa That's basically what our crew does. We've been doing Athena quests lately, but we joke around, do some pvp and explore. You make your own fun and that's what's great about this game. It can be really tense and exciting but also relaxing. Imagination is key.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnicornJessa I know right. It's always the ones who mention content too, as if there's no fun to be had/made in the game at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnicornJessa @SeaOfThieves I bet it's the skeleton crews. Each color represents a different ship/alliance? Probably not, just blowing smoke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@statickornslipx Thought it was gonna either be "breakfast" or "bacon". Who is gonna call it i-hob anyways? What a stupid decision.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#XboxE3 didn't show me enough to use my console, but I guess the good news is most of the games on Xbox are on PC. @SeaOfThieves I can't wait for the new dlc. @TheDivisionGame looks SICK. @DyingLightGame looks awesome as well. So many games.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Sof_Fun The gameplay for me was pretty fun. I'm just in love with the zombies, and the fear of night. The setting wasn't my favorite, but I was able to look past it.

<|startoftext|>@MosherGaming @SeaOfThieves @RareLtd Yeah, we had several galleons just come over and shoot at both the other ships and troll. Wasn't exactly a great experience at first, but we found a solid crew to team with finally. Was awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unfortunately it's time to not be so friendly in #SeaOfThieves anymore. You act friendly, give out treasure, make buddies and that's all fine; but it makes you soft.

<|startoftext|>@TimLegdeur @rollyjogerjones @SeaOfThieves Thats part of the fun. If you dont like it, its very simple, dont play it. But dont come on a post talking about content with a complaint about content. We are only 3 freakin weeks into this games life span, and literally the devs are talking about future stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimLegdeur @rollyjogerjones @SeaOfThieves Again, whats useless to you isnt to others. Obviously youre a type of gamer who doesnt like a "grind" by the way you talk. You also must not remember a time with even older games that had no dlc, or expansions,  where you needes to grind to unlock color variations or cosmetics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimLegdeur @rollyjogerjones @SeaOfThieves Well luckily, your definition of a complete game is different than others. Luckily, other people have imagination and can actually grind and create cool moments without needing a thousand things to do in a game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeaOfThieves Looking forward to the new threats, and im actually glad you kept it vague, I dont want things completely ruined or spoiled.

<|startoftext|>@AbuRico777 @SeaOfThieves The devs were open about this game being a social experiment, and that they would add new things as time went on. Im sorry that you cant have an imagination and play this game and make your own adventures with friends. Because thats what this has always been from day 1.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The lack of imagination people have with video games now a days is amazing. We have been so spoiled to the point where if a game doesnt have "a ton of stuff", it lacks content. Apparently no one remembers playing old games, that lacked things, but were still fun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuRico777 @SeaOfThieves Also, im fine paying what I pay because ive been in since the alphas, and have put hundreds of hours into this game before it was even released. I enjoy the game, and the core concept. Unlike most of this gen, who forgot how simple games used to be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbuRico777 @SeaOfThieves Im sorry, would you mind forming a coherent comment?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EviISteve @Heavy_Penguin @SeaOfThieves Do you visit the forums?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itchygoldwin @SeaOfThieves And I wouldnt mind winning the lotto, I guess some things just arent meant to be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@roosjames1 @SeaOfThieves A sloop can actually sink a galleon quite easily. Sloops have better turning, and if you are being chased by a galleon, sail INTO the head wind. Galleons are very slow when sailing against the wind. There are ways my friend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EviISteve @Heavy_Penguin @SeaOfThieves So if they said this week....why are you asking?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DentonVanZ @RhysRawlings @ClakyDruott @SeaOfThieves   https://t.co/zCTG9dnkLz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidallensays @DoomJudge @SeaOfThieves I understand that. But its basically become a meme about content, and sometimes its frustrating. Hundreds of comments about content when theyve already said they will have answers. Just wish people would have patience and just let em' work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DentonVanZ @RhysRawlings @ClakyDruott @SeaOfThieves A good example to follow. Smart choice, young padawan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JwCohran @elforestier87 @DentonVanZ @RhysRawlings @ClakyDruott @SeaOfThieves I understand being excited. But theres already hundreds of others asking the same question. They already gave an answer, so the video will come out when it does. People need to chill lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Heavy_Penguin @RhysRawlings @ClakyDruott @DentonVanZ @SeaOfThieves I appreciate the compliment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Heavy_Penguin @EviISteve @SeaOfThieves Did I say that? Im enjoying the game as it is, and enjoying the grind to pirate legend. The new content will come when it comes. Its called patience, something alot of you dont have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DentonVanZ @RhysRawlings @ClakyDruott @SeaOfThieves Oh my! Another thousandth person to ask about content! What ever will they do without you!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elforestier87 @DentonVanZ @RhysRawlings @ClakyDruott @SeaOfThieves So if people know, why do they need to keep commenting as if no one from RARE has stated they already have a plan for this game? Its honestly just become a meme for some of these people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DentonVanZ @RhysRawlings @ClakyDruott @SeaOfThieves Its called being realistic. Its been a month tops, and people are acting like they need to rush things out. When they shouldnt. Let them do their thing. But no, lets just keep bitching and moaning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeaOfThieves Maybe you should find something else for now to play? Otherwise, grab some friends and make an adventure of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeaOfThieves Honestly so tired of coming on here to read "content" comments. Theyve already stated they have a plan, why cant people relax and stop acting like everything needs to be delivered on a silver platter to them? Let them do their thing. If you cant enjoy the base game as it is then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RhysRawlings @ClakyDruott @DentonVanZ @SeaOfThieves And you will get it when they release it. You people dont know what it takes to answer tickets, solve bugs, handle social media, create the video content to push out. Especially for a smaller dev team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EviISteve @SeaOfThieves   https://t.co/9gOZMmDjVy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeaOfThieves Appreciate the hard work guys,  thanks @RareLtd @SeaOfThieves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoomJudge @davidallensays @SeaOfThieves You guys obviously dont understand what it takes to have a small crew of people trying to fulfill tickets, fix the bugs, manage new content, produce video content etc. I know you all want it on a silver platter but damn...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CnC_Trigger @JRodriguez81 @JacobyFC @WWE @BraunStrowman Yeah, so instead lets just bury cesaro and sheamus, the tag team titles and the division while we're at it. Oh, and lets waste all this time for this match instead of giving more time to Aj and Nakamura so they can actually go 30 minutes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eegetterman @WWEColt Simple....a man named Samoa Joe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toddphipps20 @RobertThe_3rd @melrko7 @Guz1977 @JDfromNY206 *big muscular guys I should say, since thats your actual argument.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toddphipps20 @RobertThe_3rd @melrko7 @Guz1977 @JDfromNY206 NXT is successful because of muscular guys? Seth Rollins, Bray Wyatt, Sami Zayn, Kevin Owens, Nakamura, Finn Balor, Samoa Joe, Neville; to just name a few.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadan4 Nah, because its not the WWE title, so the record theory doesnt make sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadan4 There's a reason "this is boring" and "this is awful" was being chanted. Theres a reason a chorus of boos are heard wherever Roman goes. No one was winning with this main event, regardless of who won. The saving grave is Samoa Joe beating lesnar on RAW.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadan4 The fans deserve better than seeing Roman main event yet another mania.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NotoriousDYT @TDG775 @Alexmas84351807 @BraxKedren @SeaOfThieves Im not saying people cant dislike this game, but saying there is no content on day 4 is kind of stupid in my opinion. The whole point of this game was to be a social experiment basically. They wanted people to CREATE their own adventures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TDG775 @Alexmas84351807 @BraxKedren @NotoriousDYT @SeaOfThieves They were pretty transparent about what this game was going to be. So im not sure why you are shocked then. Just saying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lakers714 @iDraKz_BDSTV @starvinghyena @BloodLord10 Triggered? No, just tired if people complaining about a game when the company was very transparent about what this game was. That and only being 4 days into launch. But, hey, do you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lakers714 @iDraKz_BDSTV @starvinghyena @BloodLord10 Oh heres the "its incomplete" cried now.  Alright, youre that kind of person, gotchya. Go play Call of Duty or something then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alexmas84351807 @BraxKedren @TDG775 @NotoriousDYT @SeaOfThieves Strato, sounds like you just get bored easily, which is not RAREs fault,  thats on your personality. They made a game to have fun with friends and create stupid moments and be a pirate. We are literally only 4 days in....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lakers714 @iDraKz_BDSTV @starvinghyena @BloodLord10 @SeaOfThieves All of their teams powers on pumping out content. Literally no gamers have a sense of creating adventure and fun anymore, they need it all on a silver platter like spoiled rich kids. Get friends, create funny moments, and be a pirate ffs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lakers714 @iDraKz_BDSTV @starvinghyena @BloodLord10 @SeaOfThieves Wow, no faith in RARE at all. You do realize they were behind some of the best games in our past right? People complaining about no content and not worth $60 clearly forgot about how games used to be. We are literally 4 days into launch. Let them fix the servers and then focus<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ronnie_LMNX @YakobSmiernov @SeaOfThieves They had them, but needed to disable them for servers due to the extra people playing probably because of the 14 day trial.

<|startoftext|>@ExistingNobody @TheWalkingDead @ScottMGimple Im salty? Just look at this tweet from yourself bud. Just like you tell me "I support what I support", so do Im But again, I forgot I cant have an opinion against Scott Gimple right? Go ahead, keep being a hypocrite.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ExistingNobody @TheWalkingDead @ScottMGimple Oh BRAVO, very good. "Carls death has a reason, blah blah, wah wah.", yeah alright. Carls death was pointless, as both Morgan and Carol, not to mention Jesus have all been preaching the same things for a while now and could have served that very purpose. They didnt want to<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheWalkingDead The only thing tense about the walking dead right now is us, pondering what pointless killing is going to happen next at the hands of @ScottMGimple and his terrible creative decisions.

<|startoftext|>@cmpuls3 @thechrisdenker Get a desk sized mouse pad. Maybe steelseries, you can find them on amazon. Maybe get a logitech mouse, itll say dpi settings and such. One that has a button where you can instantly switch on the fly is preferred.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We sunk about 10 ships last night in Sea of Thieves in about a 6hr session. We sunk 0 times, stole chests, killed boarders and made a bunch of people salty at our team work. Id say, all in all, a successful night. @Esoluu<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It amazes me that I tell someone exactly why I want to be friends with people again and I get thrown out of a community- just to have that person use reasons I gave for "moving on in life". But im the hypocrite. Seems legit.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Actually wanting to have friends, be friends and enjoy myself in this very short life. Anyone who cant see that doesnt need to be near me anyways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God forbid you do any of that, risking triggering someone else and then them throwing you out calling you a hypocrite. Yeah, you know what, sure. Im a hypocrite. Im a hypocrite for FORGIVING, FORGETTING and wanting to be HAPPY. So sorry to all those people who are offended by me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God forbid you try to make yourself a better human being by forgiving people, forgiving yourself or doing anything to improve your quality of living.

<|startoftext|>Watching @ThatKevinSmith talk about his experience in almost facing death has been a weird sort of inspiration for me. I have always feared death. Matter of fact, its a constant daily fear because of several anxiety factors. But to see him in the state he was after (1/2)<|endoftext|>
