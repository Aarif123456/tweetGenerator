<|startoftext|>@Bump21850261 @NBCMontana So 4 of 38,000 developed Bell‚Äôs palsy, normal rate in general population is higher than that.

<|startoftext|>@metalblonde1114 @pamica @TheGoodLiars I wrote the wrong number &amp; corrected myself. I read the same Johns Hopkins, NYT, CDC, etc. My point was about frontline workers being exhausted &amp; we‚Äôre having our pay cut. For an ICU/ER to have multiple people crashing at once &amp; daily is very difficult. Peace be with you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@metalblonde1114 @pamica @TheGoodLiars Urban hospital ER and ICU. Yeah, dealing with death and trauma is quite the ‚Äúbubble‚Äù. Clinical practice-meaning - part of the patient‚Äôs direct care team. Peace be with you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@metalblonde1114 @pamica @TheGoodLiars And suicide rates have been rising for several decades. Do you work in an ICU or ER? Those are the places that are getting slammed. You‚Äôre right, people aren‚Äôt going to hospitals for other conditions as much. And hospitals are losing money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@metalblonde1114 @pamica @TheGoodLiars Where? What type of healthcare work do you do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@metalblonde1114 @pamica @TheGoodLiars I work in a large urban hospital, so I know what it‚Äôs like this time of year. Covid19 is far more contagious than most influenza strains. Perhaps more people were vaccinated &amp; there are fewer opportunities to spread ‚Äòflu. Still, you don‚Äôt seem to get the human part of healthcare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@metalblonde1114 @pamica @TheGoodLiars You correct - I put in the wrong number. November deaths were about 36,000.  The daily number is increasing and my point is still, no one can expect frontline workers to keep up with this. This level of care and the number of deaths is worse than a war zone in so many places.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@metalblonde1114 @pamica @TheGoodLiars 13 countries have higher rates of death. The US has done far worse than Canada, Australia and the EU. There are 195 countries. And you are ignoring my point. Healthcare workers are getting sick &amp; dying. ICUs &amp; hospitals are overwhelmed in many areas. Do you not care?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@metalblonde1114 @pamica @TheGoodLiars Seriously @metalblonde1114 Im curious, do you get what I‚Äôm saying? 90,000 people died of Covid19 in November. Other countries have nowhere near the rate of infection and death the US has had.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast @EricTopol It‚Äôs one of my main themes. The phrase ‚Äúout of an abundance of caution‚Äù is only applicable to rich white (mostly) Republican men as they head to an inpatient stay at a nice hospital -  with a pulse ox level of 97%.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BRRN_Fed @GrimKim My hospital, my brother‚Äôs hospital have both cut employee‚Äôs earned paid time off, saying they can‚Äôt afford it.

<|startoftext|>@kaggieguy @Jen234567 @DrAngelaCDunn Yeah, the Great Barrington thing isn‚Äôt going to convince me. The problem with the young getting ‚Äúimmunity‚Äù is they don‚Äôt live alone.

<|startoftext|>@kaggieguy @Jen234567 @DrAngelaCDunn She was talking about in-hospital xfer to ICU. Also, you understand how costly an airlift is?

<|startoftext|>@WeirdestAsp631 @wobadub @RNCResearch @mschlapp Donald Wright‚Äôs ballot was received. It was not counted. And, if this is voter fraud, it should be looked into and that is being done.

<|startoftext|>@ShivasIrons3 @dylabel @basurer58249985 @carlquintanilla @gtconway3d @Stanford @AaronBelkin Okay, I really don‚Äôt want to argue what is the verifiable experience I‚Äôm having at my #1 US ranked hospital and my brother, a doctor, is having at his in Massachusetts. We cannot get enough N95 masks, bottom line. You might have KN95 but N95 are supposed to be reserved healtcare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShivasIrons3 @dylabel @basurer58249985 @carlquintanilla @gtconway3d @Stanford @AaronBelkin You can‚Äôt get N95 masks. At my hospital they are rationed. 3M is the primary manufacturer in the US and they can‚Äôt make them fast enough. A cloth mask of two different fabrics + physical distancing have been shown to help prevent transmission.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SavannahVielle @LoganRThompson @ABC You are still not listening-the article is not about drug deaths, it‚Äôs about excess deaths overall in the age group. Please read the sentence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavannahVielle @LoganRThompson @ABC It‚Äôs ‚Äúall cause deaths‚Äù that are the sample -not deaths by overdose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavannahVielle @LoganRThompson @ABC You have to read the whole article, I don‚Äôt think you understood. The point is the extra deaths overall, not overdose deaths. I would also argue that people who use drugs have many issues causing them to do this and lack of  good, consistent mental health treatment doesn‚Äôt help.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lancehashtags @NYCPBA_GC I think, and this is the point with experiencing racism, if one isn‚Äôt Jewish, Black etc., then one probably won‚Äôt ‚Äúsee‚Äù racism or anti-Semitism because it‚Äôs not generally directed your way.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lancehashtags @NYCPBA_GC The NYP is right wing. I think that people confuse being pro-Israel with not being anti-Semitic.

<|startoftext|>@MorrisAnimal Absolutely- if it helps gets funding increased (I volunteer for @ACCTPhilly ) by the City and gets more people involved fostering, rescuing, neutering/spaying and helps to increase responsible adoption and pet ownership, all for it!<|endoftext|>
