<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr @MittRomney @LindseyGrahamSC @lisamurkowski @GovChristie So now @realDonaldTrump fires Secretary Esper in retaliation. trump is trying to steal the election.

<|startoftext|>@Dominiq84085818 Thank you for the warning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RickSantorum Russian bounties on our troops. And do you think all the 26 women who allege trump assaulted them were lying? Would you even forgive trump if he did what he bragged he could do on 5th Avenue? What kind of a phony Christian are you? Even if you don't know, God does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RickSantorum Is there any despicable behavior from @realDonaldTrump you will NOT forgive? You supported him after he said white supremacists were good people, and after he sided with Russia over our own intelligence, after he ridiculed our military veterans.....continued<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gtconway3d I have a thought. Since @realDonaldTrump et al are the ones who are actually trying to steal the election, how about we try to re-direct the #stopthesteal hashtag to reflect that trump is the attempted election thief?

<|startoftext|>@BarbaraComstock @gtconway3d How about instead of contributing to trump's legal team, we start a gofundme to buy @realDonaldTrump @RudyGiuliani @LindseyGrahamSC @mschlapp a bridge they can live under in retirement. That is where trolls live, right?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TaraSetmayer None of those people are currently POTUS and therefore not immune from arrest like trump allegedly is. Why have they not been arrested?

<|startoftext|>Oh, for a moment I thought @RickSantorum was going to end his sentence with "It's time for someone to stand up to donald trump and get him to accept reality." Instead it was more like "It's time for someone to stand up and look into the (phony) ballot conspiracy stuff." Sigh.@CNN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gtconway3d He has lost almost all touch with reality. Fortunately his good friend @POTUS44 got #Obamacare passed and I believe there is mental health counseling coverage. @gtconway3d It is way past time for more of the @GOP to speak out before trump incites his followers anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To our allies in Europe, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, Japan, and all over the world. Please don't judge all Americans by trump and his supporters. Millions more Americans voted for Biden over trump. We voted for sanity and to be your ally again. Biden will win this. Thank you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>YES! @DanaBashCNN @jaketapper He NEEDS an intervention. Fortunately his good friend @POTUS44 got #Obamacare passed and it offers mental health counseling coverage!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Yair_Rosenberg He has lost almost all touch with reality.  Fortunately his favorite person in the whole world, @POTUS44 pushed through #obamacare and I believe there is a mental health counseling coverage. trump should get help for his condition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nana2chainz meltdown in 3....2....1.... He is crazy but #Obamacare covers mental health counseling<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden @KamalaHarris @POTUS44 @HillaryClinton @SpeakerPelosi  @CNN There is a phony conspiracy theory  page on @Facebook called 'stop the steal' that urges people to 'fight' against counting legitimate votes.

<|startoftext|>@facebook Is the fake conspiracy theory page 'Stop the Steal' up on your site? Won't you be liable for any violence that occurs if you don't take the page down?

<|startoftext|>@BrianSimsPA Thanks handsome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanaBashCNN trump can't run in 2024 if he is in jail for tax fraud and other crimes. @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris @SpeakerPelosi trump must be fully investigated and put in jail if convicted. He must also be held criminally and civilly responsible for election violence he incites!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN Just reported trump is already considering running again in 2024. He is already crazy. In four years, he will probably be completely insane. @JoeBiden @SpeakerPelosi  this is just *one more reason* to FULLY investigate and prosecute trump for all his AND his families crimes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Legally and financially responsible! If @realDonaldTrump foments violence, he should be prosecuted AND sued.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abbydphillip @CNN @jaketapper Of course the trump's minions believe the conspiracy theories @realDonaldTrump spews, just like they believed pizzagate, Q-anon and the other lies. I hope the election ends peacefully, but if not, trump &amp; @FoxNews must be held legally responsible!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kathygriffin Yes, thank you :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kathygriffin Yeah, I wonder who came up with that great idea. Trying to shut the ballot counting facility down while their candidate is still behind? Got some smart people calling the shots there, huh? Lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ananavarro They're awesome. You're awesome. La próxima vez que Florida será azul! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArmandoACardon1 @ananavarro @CNN Gracias Boricua :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankFigliuzzi1 @_ReaalAmerican_ @CNN Says they are still counting but the press has to leave due to safety concerns. This mob is not thinking this through. Don't they want more cameras in the room, not less? If they do stop voting in AZ right NOW, trump will lose in AZ. #becarefulwhatyouaskfor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisCuomo Do you really think trump is unhappy with the angry mob outside the ballot facility in Arizona? trump is a bully. He is probably happy his supporters are following in his footsteps. Now if they STOP counting in AZ, trump loses. Not thinking that one through, are they?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArmandoACardon1 @ananavarro @CNN You, too Armando. I probably should not have used the p word though.  Take care and be blessed also.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ananavarro Hey linda, watching you on @CNN right now :)  Now, back to the pendeja Paula. Does she not realize God has weighed in on the race? Do you think he would have allowed the Covid-19 pandemic magnify how incompetent trump is if he wanted trump to win again? Nah.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do the trump supporters protesting outside the ballot counting location in Maricopa realize that if they stop counting now, like right now, then @JoeBiden &amp; @KamalaHarris will win Arizona and quite possibly the presidency?  #priceless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That mob in Maricopa County, AZ is now screaming 'Stop the steal,' and the Sheriff's deputies are protecting the building. trump is a thug and a wannabe dictator.  If trouble erupts there, it is trump's fault and @FoxNews @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Prison4Trump @OkanaganLeigh Oh, I have had a meme that might go viral ready for a week.  I don't want to jinx us and tweet it out now, but your screen name is part of it lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PalmerReport @FoxNews Created the monster (@realDonaldTrump) and now the monster's minions are coming for the creator. How #frankensteinesque<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamParkhomenko lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN @Acosta Hey Jim, you are an awesome reporter on an awesome network, BUT, @realDonaldTrump cannot 'claw it back.'  The votes have been cast.  They are being counted now. No more votes can be cast even though some that were already cast may be received in some places. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, BUT, I draw the line at trying to find common ground with racists and fascists.  There will be no common ground found with people who support racism and fascism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VanJones68 @davidaxelrod YES! @TheDemocrats need to reach out more to the Latino community, *especially* in South Florida where too many people in the Cuban community mistakenly think @realDonaldTrump represents their interests.  That MUST be #1 on the @DNC To Do List please!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PalmerReport More like a fucking lunatic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If somehow your conscience let you vote for @realDonaldTrump because your #401k was more important than not re-electing a racist fascist, *just wait* and see what will happen to your #401k when trump refuses to concede.  The markets hate uncertainty (and lunatic leaders btw)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Your exact words should be, "I CHALLENGE @realDonaldTrump to stop attacking our democracy and let our citizen's votes be counted!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden @KamalaHarris You have said many times that @realDonaldTrump is a threat to our democracy and you are right! There is no bigger threat to democracy than trying to undermine our free elections. In your speech, CHALLENGE the bully to shut up and let the votes be counted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump campaign sues to stop ballot count in Michigan :  https://t.co/51rrG5vWDE via @AOL   Can any powerful Republicans who still have a conscience do something legally  to stop #TyrantTrump ?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gtconway3d @SteveSchmidtSES @ananavarro @madrid_mike @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris The trump campaign just announced a recount request in WI alleging irregularities. trump has tried to destroy our democracy for four years.

<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 @CNN should really break in and fact check.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN Um, can you please break in and fact check #douchebagdonald because he is claiming a victory in many undecided states.  Either that or call AZ for @JoeBiden and teach the douche a lesson.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mdnij34 Calm, but cautious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_ReaalAmerican_ @MeghanMcCain Don't forget looking the other way while the #magamaniacs are blocking bridges, trying to run the @JoeBiden bus off the road and ramming a staffers car. Why hasn't anyone been arrested for those things yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeghanMcCain Just from the trump family? What about his kool-aid drinkers who believe each one of the 20k documented lies he has told and are driving around trying to run the @JoeBiden bus off the road and blocking bridges to NYC? Will trump be held responsible for inciting their violence?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FrankBruni You were awesome on @CNN! I, too, have wondered how so many fellow Americans could be so broken as to keep supporting trump through the lies, betrayals, fomenting of violence and racism. How can one evil man have so much power over people? #trumpistheDevil<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kathygriffin I hope and pray the election ends peacefully after @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris win, but I am very worried it won't. trump must be held legally responsible for any violence that happens after he has been going around fomenting it.

<|startoftext|>@Monkey26697239 @reedgalen @TheRickWilson @SteveSchmidtSES @RadioFreeTom @MichaelSteele @madrid_mike @jwgop @NHJennifer Biden winning will only be the beginning.

<|startoftext|>@JuddApatow @DebraMessing @BetteMidler I think the only mistake @WhoopiGoldberg made during her 90's talk show was not having @kirstiealley and #war founder #tommetzger on the same show. They have so much in common.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuddApatow @DebraMessing @BetteMidler I find @kirstiealley's trump support just as revolting you do, but I do have to admit @kirstiealley is a great actress. I mean, she played a very convincing anti-racist in #northandsouth and now we all know that was DEFINITELY acting, right?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pcberrands @gtconway3d @KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump And here is another gem from Yoda that sums up @realDonaldTrump, “The Fear Of Loss Is A Path To The Dark Side.” @realDonaldTrump fears losing most of all, and most signs indicate he is about to lose an election, big time!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChrisEvans This tweet has nothing to do with your smart sexy self.  Just thought you might find it funny.  Hope you make it through the next #avengers you are always the best part of those movies and you rock that beard! Grrrr.  https://t.co/KFxeuXphpK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisEvans @realDonaldTrump Still smart and still sexy.  Well @ChrisEvans is smart and sexy.  @RealDonad_Trump is a big orange wrecking ball of stupidity the likes of which we have never seen before and will hopefully never see again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kathygriffin @jonstewartbooks @michelleisawolf @JimCarrey @LateNightSeth @StephenAtHome @iamsambee You would think @RealDonad_Trump would be more friendly to the gay community.  After all, it is now obvious that @IvankaTrump has TWO mommies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kathygriffin @jonstewartbooks @michelleisawolf @JimCarrey @LateNightSeth @StephenAtHome YES @iamsambee was wrong, @IvankaTrump is NOT a feckless **** that would be her dad @RealDonad_Trump. After his putin meeting it's obvious he has no balls and likely no penis either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimCarrey Please consider for your next painting. putin and kim jong un walking down the street HOLDING HANDS with their good little @RealDonad_Trump orange dog on all fours at the end of the leash with his big DUMB wet tongue hanging out so happy to be walked by his OWNERS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonReaganJr The party your father helped build into the modern day GOP is in perile as is our country.  Will all the Reagan's speak out against this tyranny?  There is no greater danger to our country than @RealDonad_Trump  Maybe you should run against him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealDonad_Trump @JimCarrey @kathygriffin @DebraMessing @NancyPelosi @JeffFlake @johnmccain2016 @chuckschumer hey trump we already know you are putin's bitch but HOW DARE YOU make OUR COUNTRY putin's bitch.  Is there no depth you won't sink to? You disgust me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenAtHome If voters don't want to elect a politician in 2O2O, we at least NEED someone who values #honesty #truth #civilrights #women #afreepress #freedomofspeech (that one's for you #marvelousmisskathy) #decency and #equality in other words #dontbeevil VOTE #OPRAH2O2O<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jk_rowling Ms. Rowling, I am an American but love your books.  I can't vote for you, but I think you would make an excellent PMUK. #justsayin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BTW those are all O's not zeroes 😀😀😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Oprah Last tweet for today.  You said you were waiting for a sign.  Well here it is.  This is #OPRAH2O2O  https://t.co/tyC5lQ0mAq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Oprah Our current president has been able to convince millions of people that his lies are true.  We are being confronted with a super-human evil. ☹️ To win, we are going to need some superheroes.  And you are the closest we have to one of those. 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Oprah But he is also trying to convince people that lying is ok, and that the truth doesn't matter.  As you told us in your eloquent quote, the truth does matter!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Oprah Well our current president has attacked our free press, which is also your beloved profession.  Our current president has attacked many of the people who make our country great.  Our current president has even attacked our closest allies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Oprah Do you remember when you said "I made a mistake and I left the impression that the truth does not matter. And I am deeply sorry about that, because that is not what I believe."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Oprah Can we talk?  I know you said you don't want for president, but Oprah, your country needs you.  Oprah, the world needs you.  Please hear me out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimCarrey Too many weak minds believe him and faux news<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimCarrey @realDonaldTrump He must have been abused to end up so demented<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kathygriffin up the ass #nolube<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kathygriffin Yes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kathygriffin Well he is a republican so he probably enjoys them on the dl....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kathygriffin His base knew he was an admitted sexual assaulter of women and elected him anyway.  They have forfeited ANY right to complain about vulgarity directed at @realDonaldTrump aka #douchebagdonald, @IvankaTrump or any member of the trump klan (pun possibly intended)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kathygriffin Gifts from God don't brag about sexually assaulting women by saying "grab em by the pussy." I would be more likely to believe he is the Devil since he appears to have the power to make large number of people believe things that are provably false. #scary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kathygriffin Truthful and eloquent.  Preach!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MalcolmNance @DebraMessing We have to fight and use everything we can think of within the law to make sure trump is not re-elected.  He is the biggest threat to our democracy since WWII.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kathygriffin Miss Kathy, I find it best to try to ignore tweets with poor grammar and punctuation.  Someone PLEASE tell @Jamierodr10 that those of us on the left are not sickening and pathetic.  However, not knowing the difference between "your" and "you're" is indeed sickening and pathetic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DebraMessing I am glad Rosanne's show was canceled also.  @realDonaldTrump is not draining the swamp.  He IS the swamp.  https://t.co/8mBXqVgMRy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kathygriffin Try not to listen to the hate.  If you let them get to you, you let the #evilpeople win.  #loveyoukathy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimCarrey The #deplorables attack you for your satirical art, but will they condemn racism from @therealroseanne ?  Probably not. #sad   Love you @JimCarrey #staystrong  https://t.co/jmVCj8PJUg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kathygriffin They try to crucify you for a completely political satirical photo, but will they condemn racism from @therealroseanne ? Probably not. #sad   Love you @kathygriffin #staystrong  https://t.co/jmVCj8PJUg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @therealroseanne IIRC you used to be a feminist back in the day. I don't know what made you run to the dark side but PLEASE GET HELP! You have already destroyed your career. Don't destroy your life, too, over a pathetic pos like @realDonaldTrump . #therealroseanne #sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Roseanne's Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values, and we have decided to cancel her show," ABC announced Tuesday.  https://t.co/wZtcFrd4xr via @HuffPostEnt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenAtHome I thought this would make a great #snlparody but never heard back from them. Maybe you know someone?  I have have a few more where this came from.  https://t.co/j0HeZl47kP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>sad but true  https://t.co/dj8T5dG76b<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jim Carrey Thank you for standing up and speaking out. This is a battle between good and evil and you are on the side of the angels. I thought this would make a great #snlparody but never heard back from them. Maybe you know someone?  I have have a few more where this came from  https://t.co/S60WQmJFlG<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@alyankovic Hey Weird Al do you still do parody songs?  Do you dislike trump as much as me? Here you go.  Hope you like it.  Hope you shoot it.  https://t.co/Eco7NAcoAV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @AlecBaldwin and @mckinnonupdates you all are awesome playing trump and #cruellaconway and I miss @melissamccarthy as sean spicer.  I wrote a #resistanceremix of #wearetheworld that would make an awesome @nbcsnl #parodyvideo please :)  https://t.co/kH5QNYrNtY<|endoftext|>
