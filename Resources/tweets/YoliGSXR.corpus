<|startoftext|>@_yagirlnichelle @erykajackson1 @BlknFlourishing Someone else made as a meme is somehow better?  "We all look demonic in photos we don’t pose"   You said yourself he looks demonic.  Maybe it's your first time on Twitter but these jokes happen often and with everyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jusderric @kaylanior @DaNightWonder @Mkf257 You said "A lot of y'all don't care about black men". I'm seeing the opposite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_yagirlnichelle @erykajackson1 @BlknFlourishing Which is why this has nothing to do with colorism. If he was any other shade looking demonic, people would say the same thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erykajackson1 @BlknFlourishing It's just a bad pic of the guy that makes it look creepy. Just like the flash makes people's eyes red in pictures sometimes.   I'm agreeing with you by the way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jusderric @kaylanior @DaNightWonder @Mkf257 I haven't seen one negative comment yet.  However there are plenty of comments offering prayers and hoping he is found. Whatever comments you are seeing, I know there are a lot more positive than negative.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@vtbirkenstock @SarahdawnH @LVikkiml I'm glad you did at least adopt.   No one is saying anything about abortion and birth control, however if typical birth control fails, sometimes women have no other option. Birthing a child can be very dangerous for the body.  Also no one is saying release all of the prisoners.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Freeyourmindkid This one video I kept seeing last night was saying they were burning Kentucky, but it was just a trash can on fire.  Now maybe more fires started later, but the BS was strong.  I can't find those posts today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreRVA @StylesJanea I wonder as well. But I will say looking at his Insta he uses 777 often and does spray paint in lime green. Could still be a coincidence but the guy is nuts either way.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@marymredoutey @HandleOfRy @BybeeWinecloud @MTrollbots @nerdlypainter @allisongill Thanks for your input. Have a nice day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MTrollbots @HandleOfRy @BybeeWinecloud @marymredoutey @nerdlypainter @allisongill Never said I did that. Please don't put words in my mouth or assume anything. Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MTrollbots @HandleOfRy @BybeeWinecloud @marymredoutey @nerdlypainter @allisongill I also learned a lot about the Holocaust and Nazi propaganda. Bots aren't the first and won't be the last to do this.  You tend to see the pattern.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HandleOfRy @BybeeWinecloud @marymredoutey @MTrollbots @nerdlypainter @allisongill Except that's not what I said. I'll leave our convo on mute. You aren't adding anything except insults and I'm good with arguing with trolls.   See I don't fall for BS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MTrollbots @HandleOfRy @BybeeWinecloud @marymredoutey @nerdlypainter @allisongill I know you think what you are saying is deep, so I'll bite. Sure I could be influenced too.  As someone else on this thread said though, if it makes you angry you should question it, which is what I do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HandleOfRy @BybeeWinecloud @marymredoutey @MTrollbots @nerdlypainter @allisongill So you don't actually want to discuss, you just want to make jokes. Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HandleOfRy @BybeeWinecloud @marymredoutey @MTrollbots @nerdlypainter @allisongill You learn to see the pattern. I'm not claiming to be smarter than anyone else. I just notice things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HandleOfRy @BybeeWinecloud @marymredoutey @MTrollbots @nerdlypainter @allisongill I grew up in the era of "If everyone else jumped off the bridge would you jump too?".  I learned to question trends early on and not follow the herd just because.   Qanon claims to do the research but they parrot everyone else, same with people influenced by bots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SRPainter @oliverdarcy @TuckerCarlson That was sarcasm FYI. Not agreeing with him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SRPainter @oliverdarcy @TuckerCarlson It's someone else's fault he got things wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allisongill @OhNoSheTwitnt @kara_huffman I don't know you but I follow you and see some of your posts. I feel like this may apply. I hope you're not offended.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BybeeWinecloud @marymredoutey @MTrollbots @nerdlypainter @allisongill I think she's saying the people who use a lot of the same language as the bots are not bots themselves but people who have been influenced by bots like she was at one point.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Lilmo2nd @RyanOfMichigan @vivala_me These same people give employers the right to deny birth control. If birth control, condoms,  IUDs were all more accessible than maybe abortion rates would be lower too. People are going to have sex whether they like it or not.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SixerIverson04 @ThomasFBeaver @LASDHQ Your mind is made up. No point in me even trying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bdanielmartinez @LASDHQ You know that not legal right?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_Vampire_Jesus_ @Freeyourmindkid Exactly. But people want to call it 'resisting'. We all have a natural flight or fight response.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SammyQc @lizzieyjs @rememvictorjara Minimum wage hasn't changed much since I graduated college in 2001. Funny thing, my total 4 years of college cost about the same as one year for a student now.  I can't imagine paying 4x my tuition now with the same paycheck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@zojjauniquelyu @KingGetoBoy @ComplexSports So you're saying the hatred for kneeling was never about the flag? Yeah we know.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@X1Detroit @TomGallagher33 @ohRAM0NA @CrabbyPatty1117 @sean_antrim @JoeBiden When you start a new thread you miss where I have already addressed this.    Redirecting my paycheck for taxes and healthcare benefits me. Redirecting funds for police for training, etc helps them.  Also still haven't explained doubling anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ImJustLightskin @Kelly35166759 @battletested5 I should have scrolled first because I posted the same thing. Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Freeyourmindkid What is happening? Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@X1Detroit @TomGallagher33 @ohRAM0NA @CrabbyPatty1117 @sean_antrim @JoeBiden You're talking out of your ass. How did you get doubling it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradyMojitsu @HeatherJfs @CynthiaHennecke @MollyJongFast Exactly. Especially when they have both a gender reveal party and a baby shower.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump More anonymous sources from you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Maxx01000111 @anthony94121093 @jazminesmith0 @freakymarko @iamcardib If you kneel on someone's neck, what is your intent? He had 8 minutes to get off and realize it wasn't a good idea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatriotInUSA @JayySelestina @MarisaMurray52 @iamcardib So you're saying he knows nothing about politics. Yeah we know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Maxx01000111 @anthony94121093 @jazminesmith0 @freakymarko @iamcardib Odd, that "amount of fentanyl" he didn't DIE while walking around the store, he only died after being pinned to the ground and having his neck kneeled on.  Makes me think the cause of death was murder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@X1Detroit @TomGallagher33 @ohRAM0NA @CrabbyPatty1117 @sean_antrim @JoeBiden My money is redirected all the time. It goes to taxes and insurance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dthmath @RexChapman That is so awesome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomGallagher33 @ohRAM0NA @CrabbyPatty1117 @sean_antrim @JoeBiden Um, the training is for the police.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomGallagher33 @ohRAM0NA @CrabbyPatty1117 @sean_antrim @JoeBiden If you redirect funds towards training instead of more overtime, it's not defunding, it's redirecting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itssgeorgia I'm shocked Pierce defending LGBTQ.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FLOTUS @TheAtlantic Trumpsters believe QANON, which is an anonymous source.    Trump can say "Many people have said", and you all believe him too.  Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelharriot Trumpsters believe QANON, which is an anonymous source.    Trump can say "Many people have said", and you all believe him too.  Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davestei @funder @NikkiHaley @realDonaldTrump I figured she was the one who said that. Pure lies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomGallagher33 @ohRAM0NA @CrabbyPatty1117 @sean_antrim @JoeBiden he said yes to redirecting some of the funding. He did not say anything about defunding the police. You lie you lie you lie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gustavoflo24 @AllenciaMiguel Figures.  All the same trumpsters every time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gustavoflo24 @AllenciaMiguel You didn't answer the question. Stormy can be a liar (like Trump) and still have had sex with Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndreaB33774513 @StefanieandAdam @Freeyourmindkid Did they seriously rename it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gustavoflo24 @AllenciaMiguel  https://t.co/zyjq3xSKOG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gustavoflo24 @AllenciaMiguel So Trump didn't have sex with Stormy while he was married? Interesting that you believe that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DarkJokerXIII @JoyAnnReid If your claim is that he could have gotten it anywhere then why bring up protesters?  Was he in direct contact with them?  The rally was June 20. 9 days later he tested positive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kushibo @Freeyourmindkid I heard there was a basement at Benghazi where they were packaging children sold from Wayfair sales.  ...and something about pizza<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fkakiara Ok. I came to Twitter to figure out episode 6 and people in England are already on the finale.  What did you interpret with that episode? The chick was lying the whole time? Why does she have a support group? I get the boy taking a picture was bad though.  I'm confused.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Madge1428 @RRH79678443 @KewOnly @el3mentofchange @pwidakuswara @realDonaldTrump He mentioned pizza in his profile. Isn't that qanon pedophilia code, Pizzagate and all?  https://t.co/v4bwkKdr9p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Freeyourmindkid But I've been agreeing with you.    Seriously after watching  flat-earthers on Netflix I understand a little how the qanon folks operate.  I second guess myself all the time.   I truly believe you though because of our nation's past.  These tactics are nothing new.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LizVicBo @Freeyourmindkid I'm so naive I thought they only had secret groups on Facebook, 4chan, and whatever that other one is that you had to be invited into.  I honestly haven't seen it much on Twitter.   Too many hate groups out there with so much power. 😥<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Atticus310 @InfamousAOne @jameelajamil The warrant was only because she had some packages delivered there from the man I  custody, and they assumed it was a 'trap house' and yet found nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Atticus310 @InfamousAOne @jameelajamil The facts also the police had a no knock warrant which means they did not have to announce themselves. The BF who is a legal gun owner had ever right to shoot at someone breaking into his home at like 3am.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Freeyourmindkid Today some idiot posted a screenshot of a black lives matter post that said people should riot.

<|startoftext|>@FeminineMonk @Freeyourmindkid Yes, the same people that were against government tyranny and want a 'well regulated militia'.    Funny how quickly they change their minds<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KingJepNap @BIGD088 @Ilovelampstill1 @BlackBriar21 @CoryBooker They had a no-knock warrant which means they did not announce themselves. He shot at what he thought was an intruder.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@phall3010 @JamilSmith @DavidCornDC @RollingStone Absolutely. There is no reason it had to be done at 1am. I would have shot too if my door was kicked in during the middle of the night.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nhannahjones I didn't see your tweet on Friday but I agree with you.  There are a lot of teachers doing a tremendous job and there are some who are doing the least amount possible.

<|startoftext|>@TalbertSwan His supporters still think it's a hoax so it won't stop them from voting for him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@QArmyRanger @eatsthenews @a4patt @38887818601e47c @dvillella @realDonaldTrump Everyone in the thread is saying it is a hoax. Where do you think they heard it from? Also Trump's son said the same thing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dvillella @realDonaldTrump That way when it all fails, he can blame the next president.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joyechippenham @Freeyourmindkid That is true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jameelajamil Sometimes it's like that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InspiringU2 I'm afraid we won't see the true negative effects of his presidency until years after he is gone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilibabicz @jameelajamil So if you're not discriminated against, you are privileged against those who are.  I feel like you do agree. You just don't seem to like the word "privileged".  "I'd say that the discriminated are at a disadvantage due to whatever they're discriminated for"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maddsmedia @Hoodie702 @l_powles @DhotyaShield I think he was being sarcastic making fun of the ones who are saying that. That's sarcastic writing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lmtmojo @l_powles Serious question.  No judgement (from me at least).  Did you believe it was a problem before it happened to you or only after did you realize what women go through?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CelticBird23 @dcumicstanz @JohnBoyega Exactly what? I know it doesn't mean ALL.  Also context is important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CelticBird23 @dcumicstanz @JohnBoyega No. I don't steal so I know it's not about me or all black people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CelticBird23 @panna1980 @dcumicstanz @JohnBoyega Protector because I asked a question that you ALL apparently can't comprehend what was written?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CelticBird23 @dcumicstanz @JohnBoyega So you ASSumed that's what he meant. There were some white people who were upset about it. There was even an article.  There were other white people defending it.  If you felt it applied to you then...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Aeromixx1 @TH3HUMANSPIDER @JohnBoyega Did you mention your age to them in your original post?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@panna1980 @dcumicstanz @JohnBoyega Point me the "all" in his statement.   https://t.co/KWoSq0oqVw<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Girls_philly @NicholasFerroni @AOC I didn't ask him.  People receive gifts. Maybe his family wanted to keep in touch with him. Come to Richmond and I'll point him out and you can ask.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jd1202nj @aliggio1 @MarkDice @nytimes @jd1202nj yup. I thought the answer was obvious but @aliggio1 apparently doesn't get it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Alois7169 @RiblyMcGee @MarkDice @nytimes The people were still honored. Tearing up a piece of paper doesn't make all that disappear.  It's on tape and more copies can be made.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Michelm0808 @MikeBloomberg I keep reporting them when I see them.  They do it to multiple accounts.  Twitter doesn't seem to do anything.  Just search 'Elon' and they come up.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TeensieFreedom @Molongangsta1 Things can't progress because the facts and proof are right in front of you and you still find a way to deny it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeensieFreedom @Molongangsta1 You asked for an example, I gave you one, and now you are making excuses.  Bad joke? Nah, racist "joke" period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snarkysissy @Amy_Siskind @Sifill_LDF @Amtrak I was on Amtrak a few months ago.  I don't understand your comment though.  They check you tickets when the train is moving.  They can see when her stop is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amy_Siskind @Sifill_LDF @Amtrak How can someone start recording before they know the incident is about to happen.? The whole interaction probably only lasted a few seconds.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PandesalLove @ClayTravis Yes I saw 3 total. Not exactly leftist "OUTRAGE".  3 people don't speak for everyone, but okay.   Like I said, more complaining about "outrage" than actual outrage.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wmpasker @Peter_Madonna @shaunking @neontaster @HudsonInstitute Weird how you think that situation is the same, but okay.  Everyone's a badass in the dark.

<|startoftext|>@wmpasker @Peter_Madonna @shaunking @neontaster @HudsonInstitute And that is not the "core principal" of the internet. Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wmpasker @Peter_Madonna @shaunking @neontaster @HudsonInstitute That's why it's called keyboard warrior.

<|startoftext|>@shaunking @neontaster @HudsonInstitute I guess all his fans are mad and here to defend him.  Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wmpasker @Peter_Madonna @shaunking @neontaster @HudsonInstitute What rights were taken away? He is allowed to bully and people are allowed to call him out. He hasn't been censored or arrested. His freedom of speech hasn't been taken away.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jjharris1987 @Jessica42389899 @TheTomatoBob @MarkDice @Kaepernick7 🤦🏾‍♀️America kept them as slaves for over 200 years.  They raped, killed and tortured them.  Thats terrorism.  How they got them doesn't make them any less guilty.   You people are exhausting.  Keep deflecting and I'm done with this conversation.  Bye.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jessica42389899 @TheTomatoBob @MarkDice @Kaepernick7 We are literally talking about America and you keep deflecting.  Stop deflecting and stay on topic, but I know you can't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jessica42389899 @TheTomatoBob @MarkDice @Kaepernick7 And America still had them as slaves. What part of your statement absolves America? You also conveniently glossed over everything else I said.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheTomatoBob @MarkDice @Kaepernick7 Just now? I'm sorry, did you miss The Trail of Tears, Slavery, Civil Rights movement and many of American pastimes. America has always been.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVileV @MarkDice @Kaepernick7 No thanks. I'm an American and I would like to build a better America than to leave it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheTomatoBob @MarkDice @Kaepernick7 That was my point. America is<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@funder @DonCheadle He tweeted it too..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkDice @Kaepernick7 If we were siding with terrorists we'd be siding with America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeySalads @Kaepernick7 Except he's not supporting a terrorist at all. He is saying America has always been a terrorist. You missed his point entirely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trucilamutasa @TalbertSwan @buckshot221 @realDonaldTrump There are many wars God didn't stop. Why do you think it'll happen now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lonnettekelly @jackieaina The first time it happens, it's easy to freeze. The 2nd time it happens is a different story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tyronda0414 @jackieaina Like a ninja. What did she do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ari_Jan267 @Freeyourmindkid Same. Airforce to help pay for college.  I didn't sign up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MChaseRadio I always worry they will jump out and chase a squirrel or something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rolandixor @Freeyourmindkid OMG that picture 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreeNewsome That's how the police deescalate problems.  They shoot people.  Same thing right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mayleague @elvisduran I'm sorry I missed it. Sounds like it was funny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYPDTruth @IlhanMN Yeah, almost the same as starting a war. You are so smart. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonCheadle I like that black guy in it. He's usually a good actor. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClassicFilmDame @flofraz2 @amandaretta @ChefArtSmith @sis2catbat Getting blocked because she can't explain her logic. Figures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClassicFilmDame @flofraz2 @amandaretta @ChefArtSmith @sis2catbat I still don't understand the correlation.  A chef writing a superstition wrong. Because he's associated with Oprah, he shouldn't make mistakes? I'm just trying to figure this out. Then you make fun of someone and use namaste which is interesting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Freeyourmindkid Yay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalbertSwan ❤️❤️❤️ this is a great post. So true<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LaciLou77 @TalbertSwan That would be @TalbertSwan's point. Both are terrorists but only one was labeled as such.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@princss6 @LAState0fMind @nate_bowling That's his point. They are bots<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Freeyourmindkid I'm from Henrico (Richmond, VA). I had no idea this was going on in my backyard.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AOC Wasn't Trump supposed to have some plan to dismantle "ObamaCare"? Too busy golfing I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dave67798195 @cactusflinthead @emmy_parry @AOC Mine hasn't change much since so I guess our anecdotal evidence cancels each other out.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Seanon97X @MarshaWarfield A black woman and a white woman can be the same shape and size and wear the same exact outfit, but somehow the black woman is seen as inappropriate.  Not a myth.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JTMorga61979993 @IlhanMN Oh I guess we're still on this one. 💤😴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jameelajamil @Zenaltra I think the analogy is just fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Breznican She also never mentions Trump, but all the outraged did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imanitrishawn_ Yup, same picture.  NFL and NBA I see ass cheeks hanging out. I have no problem with either but you mentioned the 'chilren' as if seeing both is any different.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imanitrishawn_ BTW I do follow you. This is just a disagreement, nothing more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imanitrishawn_ So being paid makes all the difference? Ass is hanging out regardless.  https://t.co/h2XSb9Ut8b<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imanitrishawn_ The children see just as much on the floor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imanitrishawn_ Explain?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephanieYeboah I love mine now but at first I would throw it all to one side (in my sleep) and wake up with my leg numb because there was so much weight on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Freeyourmindkid I think it's silly this is the only hill people want her to die on.   I do agree as others have said that yes she should address it and apologize if she hasn't already.  I also think if Trump didn't keep calling her Pocahontas, the anger of it would have died out already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Freeyourmindkid A lot of white and black people I knew in Massachusetts claimed to be part native because their parents told them so.  There was no DNA test then.  She thought she was so she took pride in that. She didn't make a mockery of it then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Molly_NYC @Rightturn_only @wendyoming @AngryBlackLady @ewarren Same in Massachusetts.

<|startoftext|>@AprilWh42160316 @jameelajamil Weird how I never said anything about body shaming. Don't put words in my mouth. I agree it's a hygiene issue though. I just think the people worried about 'the children' don't seem to care about the cheerleaders outfits<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imanitrishawn_  https://t.co/gSqt82AHmf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imanitrishawn_ I wasn't feeling her outfit but let's not pretend the cheerleaders don't have their asses hanging out either.  https://t.co/5rxzLou7hG<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jameelajamil I didn't like the outfit but I also didn't complain about it. She's living her best life. Besides there are a lot of bare asses in the NBA.  https://t.co/w9lR6XneF5<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sandyeggogrrrl @FatGoz @EricaConnell3 @ggggiaaa @CupcakKe_rapper 1/2 I don't think anyone is disagreeing with fasting. It's the fact that she stated she did it for a month with no other details, which can be dangerous for young minds not understanding what she did.

<|startoftext|>@BosToLax @jemelehill Thank you. I posted about this too. Why does no one else remember?  That's why he's sorry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jemelehill I'm glad he apologized. I think he definitely learned his lesson after being caught with a transwoman prostitute in 97.   People often talk bad about things they don't understand.  https://t.co/PjypongwgE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertB70940314 @donnareese931 @pacers714 @AOC @RepDebHaaland @sharicedavids She's even whiter than the woman in the video. Seriously.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@plsleaveamsg Water. Drink lots of water. It starts from the inside out.  I also love local businesses that sell Shae butters. I bought some today with shea butter, olive oil, cocoa butter and some other stuff. All natural and feels great on my skin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@formambuh @AOC  https://t.co/mBHbN0Vw83<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@formambuh @AOC He is a troll that plays both sides. Also a Trump supporter. I've seen his supportive comments on there too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nikahasfaith2 @jemelehill What tears? I see none.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RadioBethany Unless it was Halloween of course<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RadioBethany I would be scared shitless if you showed up at my house like that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgiaBelleee @kassahndra @elenacleaves Maybe read through the comments of other women who have had this experience instead of saying it isn't true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LegisEmpress @shange033 Amen. That's what I said in the past<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@k1k2lee @ChrisEvans No one tells him what to do, not even spell check. He's a stable genius ya know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scone_Mason @joncoopertweets Exactly how I feel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Freeyourmindkid You's a baby.  *(Spelled on purpose)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iLuvvit This week is getting good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Freeyourmindkid  https://t.co/8Q3Zx1PGmT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vonhonkington @Fiddlebunkers @angryblkhoemo Wow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bsbfankaren @Valhallan42nd @Freeyourmindkid I wouldn't think flat roofs work well with snow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jdmiles11 So was that on purpose for a mistrial?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump Wow that was so clever. Did you think of that on your own?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonyposnanski I completely agree   https://t.co/0VcIZ26Xm6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jodiemoss1976 @tonyposnanski Same. Those are different for some reason<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CathyCathyFox @DineshDSouza  https://t.co/AYzBN7pCxZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@V__Nasty @sextoyspolitics @Variety Yup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itssgeorgia ❤️❤️❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ripp_lisa @AOC @JamesFallows @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/edcgkh98LU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itssgeorgia Okay. And don't think for a second you are bothering me. I just worry about a complete stranger (you) more than some people I actually know.  Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@outofshelly @legallyines I think he put the gun in her cooter  "Man accidentally fatally shot woman during foreplay"   https://t.co/nqDbGfR88R<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True today. I still can't believe this is from 1974<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@losingminddaily @olivclaw @jaketapper Thanks. I never heard of that either. Guess I wouldn't miss it then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itssgeorgia Serious question. What am I supposed to do when you say these things. I worry about you then you say it's nothing. When am I to know it's serious or not. Honestly I've never had this experience with anyone so I genuinely want to understand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Roselles65 @LtDanNJ @IlhanMN I didn't say THAT was the day she denounced it. Maybe read.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itssgeorgia That is true. The free sites take other people's videos and make money off them.  I never thought of it that way. Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertMaguire_ @DonCheadle This can't really be from '74. Wow that is so messed up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itssgeorgia I agree but I don't think she's shaming the workers. She's wondering why people are paying something that's already free. Joking at the customers not the workers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Freeyourmindkid Not a damn thing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElieNYC @yolandayoungesq @JoyAnnReid As I'm playing Pokemon Go right now.  https://t.co/EMYqTpcAQw<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sextoyspolitics @Variety We all knew the 'apology' was BS to begin with. Why not double down?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MChaseRadio Now I don't feel so bad about my son's room<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tobiafolabi_ @YSGNG @DEUXSVELTE That sounds like 'smile more'.  🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsJeffTiedrich Is someone keeping track of all the scandals because I seriously lost count?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SauveShari @AOC I'm sure of it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Roselles65 @LtDanNJ @IlhanMN Um no she is an American citizen which makes her an American.  She already denounced it but she doesn't need to denounce it every damn time she gets asked. Do you get asked to denounce everytime a white American man shots up a Walmart or school?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lawrenceappell @jaketapper Maybe the IRS will find a way like they did with Capone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomr515 @jaketapper Because by Tuesday it will be another scandal. It is seriously hard to keep up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sham_Saymme @100keigh @jameelajamil Mannequins too? What!!! 😮 I need to go to Target and check that out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nathanrmarshall @NittanystkSue @jaketapper You must not have seen the latest news.  He's out. Guess you were wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@prettysdaya @thundersthor The only reasonable answer here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itssgeorgia I hope you had a good time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShackletonDVM @Freeyourmindkid That's the difficult part (I assume)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@saturnineba @SirajAHashmi Exactly what he looks like<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Freeyourmindkid We are the butt of everyone's jokes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emersoninaglass @emrazz @ewarren Lol, my comment was "lashing out" and calling you names?   That wasn't an honest question in the first place.  Why are you questioning the use of her time?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emersoninaglass @emrazz @ewarren Weird how someone can always find a negative<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarshaWarfield People still cancel Jane Fonda because "Hanoi Jane" since the 70's.  Let someone speak out against the 2nd amendment and cancel cancel cancel.  These same people complain about cancel culture.  Hypocrites as always.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimRunsHisMouth @AOC There was no social media then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanTShanks @ElvisDuranShow I find it incredibly stupid that people make racist and homophobic remarks and claim they are jokes.  If that's your shtick you need to retire. We don't accept it anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonCheadle Where are the tapes Assange apparently has? We want to know...okay not actually.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@adamback @jaybay82 @RobSchneider @Shanemgillis @adamback ❤️❤️❤️ thank you!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1leggedfreak @IlhanMN Also.. not white. She's referring to people who say....  https://t.co/ERop13RGZ1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1leggedfreak @IlhanMN Maybe you didn't read my comment then..  " https://t.co/9XIiSCBeCw"  She didn't say be Muslim instead of white.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LtDanNJ @IlhanMN Well she's American so...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1leggedfreak @IlhanMN Not once did she nor the article mention white or blamed white people. You must feel guilty if you hollered.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jxcobbbbbb @caImbaby @stfuhurt So disappointing.  I took my like back too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tommyjon2000 @BreeNewsome I didn't realize that. I thought it was more for the British or someone else invading.  Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itssgeorgia I know you must be.   I can't help you half way around the world unfortunately.  I hope you are getting the help you need.  *Hugs from here.*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itssgeorgia How can I help?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jinxmim @lsarsour What is it then? Innocent people locked up and working for nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jinxmim @lsarsour Christianity in America allows slavery too. Take a look at our current prison systems and the people that don't actually belong there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalbertSwan @RealCandaceO @Tip @FoxNews "you started with some bullshit".  Love it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonCheadle Still hott @DonCheadle 😘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Freeyourmindkid Saddest part thing in the whole series.   🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Freeyourmindkid No Sex in the City!!!  (Forgive me if this has already been said. I haven't went through all the replies yet)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreeNewsome This is why I believe slaves were taught Christianity.  Teach forgiveness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Emily72040997 @BridgetPhetasy @PatrickGman @seankent @Shanemgillis @Emily72040997 it's that word play people do to make them sound more like an innocent victim.  She isn't fooling me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BridgetPhetasy @seankent @PatrickGman @Shanemgillis "I hate mobs...". I'm sure you don't when it's something you're against   https://t.co/xuu3LaMhnw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BridgetPhetasy @PatrickGman @seankent @Shanemgillis He's not a kid and these words from his are less than a year old. This wasn't something he said in middle school.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@the_crossroad_ @jemelehill @61onsunday @FirstTake @TimTebow Disagree =/= demonize.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@XLNB @FirstTake @TimTebow I literally had a Twitter argument with a guy in one of these pictures. He had no idea he picture was used like this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SonOfNumenor313 @BreeNewsome 😢 pisses me off to read that.   *Not new news to me but sucks to hear every time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@natashaloder @Kate_H_Taylor @hcpeterson Lol I misread it too at first<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jemelehill I think his support mainly comes from name recognition.  I think that's why Trump gained followers early on because everyone knew his name and associated it with money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElvisDuranShow None. I saw everything as long as there was no sex<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DanielEHernand7 @delmoi @AOC She posted that after 10 minutes because people misinterpreted what she was saying.  It was not a retraction it was an explanation for simpletons.  I understood her first Tweet<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rynofied @TalbertSwan @monicaonairtalk @Tami_Tucci @Twitter Exactly. That's what I don't get. She brought his name into it and now is crying her pitiful tears.  https://t.co/sBLvaWBHKC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@I_A_D_I @Freeyourmindkid Best point. That makes perfect sense. Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NitaJoCool @TalbertSwan I saw the one you posted. I posted this before you replied.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BobJones4realz @ManlnTheHoody He didn't get the benefit of mental illness or video games did he?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dlawson419 Are you trying to show Clinton from 2002? That's over 16 years ago. The same amount of time ago Trump was best friends with him 🤔.  Both guilty, not just the one you don't like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NitaJoCool @TalbertSwan Found it.  https://t.co/h52fU2TbXd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NitaJoCool @TalbertSwan Does anyone have a screenshot of what she said? She blocked me yesterday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Freeyourmindkid @DebraMessing Damn now I have to read his Twitter to find it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Comey I hope all this criticism doesn't mean you are running for president too.  This sounds a lot like how @WalshFreedom started out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JAkinWalker @DonCheadle The sarcasm was obvious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whiskyandtartan @mustardvengence @Anthonycorrad19 @dlawson419 @DebraMessing @realDonaldTrump I have a partial list of the people who had waffles for breakfast yesterday  https://t.co/TINbiCjDIM<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@williamlegate More police than paraders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABeeChillin @TalbertSwan I'm wondering where were her parents during this encounter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalbertSwan I really don't believe she understood what it meant. She wanted to still play with the black girls. She has been fed these words and can't comprehend them. Where are her parents during this video? They need to explain.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Carter3Chalk @eebwee @AshleeMPreston Like I said. You don't really care what the answer is.  It was clearly explained several times but the answer doesn't matter to you.  You needed to voice your opinion and you got your attention. Congratulations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eebwee @Carter3Chalk @AshleeMPreston EXACTLY.  These 'questions' are usually just to stir trouble. He doesn't care what the answer is.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LegisEmpress I feel this thread with a passion. If I help I end up emotionally (and sometimes financially) drained, if I don't help then I'm selfish.  I was raised not to be selfish but I'm the one who ends up hurts in the end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LegisEmpress I needed the read this. Thank you.  I'm literally crying right now because of how true this statement is.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Amor2Terry @sautemaster1 @doubled2520 @jaketapper @Amor2Terry he used the tragedy for the campaign video and yet you see nothing wrong with it?  🐑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Schwarztod2 @yanqui1 @leedsgarcia @Lady_Star_Gem @Schwarztod2 that makes no sense. The same people don't want both.  I do agree they shouldn't be and business because they purposely hired undocumented workers.  They know they can pay them less.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElieNYC Happy Anniversary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amor2Terry @doubled2520 @jaketapper @Amor2Terry so he couldn't do this any other time? He did this while he was supposed to be visiting shooting victims.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DrDavidDuke This is the funniest Tweet I have ever seen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yanqui1 @leedsgarcia @Lady_Star_Gem I want to see how fast that company jumps ship to overseas.  There is no way they can afford to pay American workers a decent wage with benefits.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@amysuds @yashar @AOC I will vote for whomever I feel is qualified.  Politicians disappoint, not just women, but the men have been disappointing much longer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WillieJ95802977 @TalbertSwan @realDonaldTrump @jonvoight Name one thing he just listed that isn't true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MLCzone @BreeNewsome and blackmailing those he pimped for<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kamauwawangari @jameelajamil WELL it's not attention or validation seeking.  Her winning matches and being great in general gets her plenty of attention. I'm sure she is good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Teddysimmons198 @lulrza That's not true at all.  What he did was illegal #1.  That's pretty much all that needs to be said. He used his job to obtain her address.  If you are interested in a woman, then say something in person. Speak up.   It would not be okay if a cop did this either?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chellerr @Teddysimmons198 @lulrza Right!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ladylife999 @AfriFeminists @panjianoff @serenawilliams STFU.  That doesn't make her any less black or her struggle any less real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waaberi @SimonWaldman1 @JaniceChalmers @AfriFeminists @monaeltahawy @serenawilliams @SimonWaldman1 your first sentence was all that needed to be said.  The rest means the first part was a lie.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@landongrace2 @Mupparooni @ZachCrenshaw @BigoBoys @abc15 @Mattel It wasn't armed robbery. A pack of underwear does not justify this behavior from the police at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZachCrenshaw @phoenixpolice What made them fear she had a weapon? What exactly happened that gave them that assumption?    Liars!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ohmy_Darla @ZachCrenshaw @QasimRashid @phoenixpolice They held off as long as possible apparently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DebWalk19961736 @cakedoodle @ZachCrenshaw @QasimRashid @phoenixpolice @azcentral @facebook @DebWalk19961736 I have to agree. 'Slow rollout' sounds like BS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Freeyourmindkid Oh I saw the flags and assumed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@morriganthemage My friend did the same (I wasn't sleeping with him).  He was full of himself. I think he thought the girls would use the sperm for impregnation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Freeyourmindkid What about you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZachCrenshaw @QasimRashid @phoenixpolice I find it hard to believe that Phoenix PD doesn't have cams but my town does.  Who told you they didn't have either?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Be careful. He'll talk to his friends at Twitter to get you kicked off like a few others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itssgeorgia Have fun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChickenCaoimh @Joshua4Congress @scottfaetoon I've said the same thing in previous videos. Apparently this is his voice.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@guyhumes1914 @Raccoontrashfir @sorofia @TalbertSwan @phoenixpolice Documentation? People are shot on video and nothing happens.  What is documentation actually going to do?   The 'good ones' need to say something then and there before a shot is fired.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itssgeorgia Thank you Gemini!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beverlygough @TalbertSwan @phoenixpolice I'm crying right now. This is too much.  Why the fuck are we treated like animals?  I don't want my son to die like this.  He's only 9 and I pray for him all the time.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bethany26 @TalbertSwan Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@outdoorsyLEM @JanineMaverick @TalbertSwan @outdoorsyLEM you are looking for an enemy where there isn't one.

Listen to us for once.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@yarzacc @scatteredthings @jameelajamil @NSPCC My point is, she didn't ask kids to DM her while she was the ambassador.   You examples are from before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Freeyourmindkid Part 4 was the worse for me. I cried so much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IsawInfo38 @mar_vickers @muffinsplanned @Katatoniq @RozRaid @jameelajamil @MunroeBergdorf @NSPCC "It's way more complicated than you appear to think," What is way more complicated? People asked how and you gave no answer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yarzacc @scatteredthings @jameelajamil @NSPCC Those examples were from 2017.  She just became an ambassador according the another article only 3 days ago.  "Childline has cut ties with Munroe Bergdorf three days after the transgender activist announced she had been appointed as the charity’s first LGBT+ campaigner."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@muffinsplanned @FeministBec @TheAwesomeAutie @TomPunchy @jameelajamil @MunroeBergdorf @NSPCC Exactly @muffinsplanned. An article stated she was only with them for three days.  These posts are older than that.   "Childline has cut ties with Munroe Bergdorf three days after the transgender activist announced she had been appointed as the charity’s first LGBT+ campaigner."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mar_vickers @muffinsplanned @IsawInfo38 @Katatoniq @RozRaid @jameelajamil @MunroeBergdorf @NSPCC @IsawInfo38 and yet you still haven't provided any more information, just deflection.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Luvvie I didn't see those comments, but I don't think of it that way.  Fruit is full of fiber and too much fiber tends to give diarrhea. I don't think it was fear. It's just actually a fact. Doesn't mean you shouldn't enjoy your fruit.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChrisEvans It's a sad few years in America. Things are   going backwards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickreichart @BridgetPhetasy @realDonaldTrump They had plenty of support. They didn't create over 1,000 accounts.  I read the article. They had a few old accounts and one to keep track of the threats against them and their families.  A lot of people have a personal account and a public account. I have like 5 email addresses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOCoffice @realDonaldTrump The fact that you idiots think this is her real account is hilarious. Look for the blue check mark folks.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@William32072150 @spanishcvndy You don't know what pregnancy can do to the human body and the damage it can cause some women.  There are plenty of mothers dying after giving birth.

<|startoftext|>@GarciaGonczarow @AmyDentata @MattWalshBlog Facts from a picture with words on it (no source info) and one source from "Live Action is an American anti-abortion non-profit organization".  That's not proof.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog Can't the fetus be tested for DNA match. Why would it need to be carried to full term?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itssgeorgia I'm sorry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itssgeorgia Say what know? What happened?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kevin93527144 Absolutely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks to the two who already sent requests.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jameelajamil So I guess they are all virgins and keep it in their pants.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darkskinn_2018 Lol. Okay we are agreeing but you are arguing. I don't understand where this conversation went wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's be friends in Pokémon GO! My Trainer Code is 4630 0838 3894!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darkskinn_2018 It does matter. When I run out of bullets they still have more.  I'm going down with a fight either way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenitoJChavez @AOC @katieporteroc @RepGraceMeng @RashidaTlaib So the dad's should be at home too then? Isn't their input just as important?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@braveton @Deuces351 @IBJEWELY @nowthisnews Keep licking boots.   I'm sure the Gestapo would love your kind.  Do whatever they tell you to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Deuces351 @IBJEWELY @nowthisnews Lol, Yeap Troll. Thanks for proving my point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@braveton @Deuces351 @IBJEWELY @nowthisnews Troll because it tells you in the video he doesn't have to produce ID.  Give the cops and inch and they will take a mile. Next thing you'll be saying is he should have let the police search him, or search his house, or do whatever just because they asked politely. Nope. Not okay.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Darkskinn_2018 I carry, but they have more guns and bullets than I do.   They spend their whole 20 paychecks on guns and ammo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Deuces351 @IBJEWELY @nowthisnews Troll. Why does he need to produce ID in front of his own house? Did you even watch the video or read the text?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IBJEWELY @nowthisnews Not in my state. It can be plain as day and they would still say "why did't they just follow orders?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is America.  People don't believe us when we say this happens to us for NO reason at all.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@itssgeorgia @CaitCat0703 Same. I haven't liked her since season 3/4 too.  She used to be my fave then she got on my nerves.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ZonePhysics @MichelleObama Incredible. I hate spiders 🕷️ but that's cool to watch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Freeyourmindkid I don't know who the one on the right is. Guess I need to Google ooze since that's apparently his name<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Harray97 😂🤣🤣🤣 best response yet. Worth of a retweet. I hope you didn't steal it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShivamFFA Thanks. I didn't get it   (not sarcasm)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Luvvie I was so mad she didn't do that with the night King.  We knew she had it in her<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoyalTendencies @Freeyourmindkid I can't speak for them.  It's been documented that women and POC are not treated the same as patients.  All I'm saying is it's hard to prove.  Take what you want from it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Freeyourmindkid This is an ongoing issue with for women and POC.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Freeyourmindkid Watching it tomorrow. Grown child<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Willowsacorns @SI_Swimsuit @tyrabanks I don't think it's a hating statement.  I love her but thought the same thing. Her boobs are coming out the bottom. It doesn't quite fit correctly but she looks good either way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SI_Swimsuit @tyrabanks I'm loving the thickness Tyra. Yes Queen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amadii She's been like that forever. I never liked her.  Her business is private of course.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalbertSwan Thank you to the person recording<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@spiggeragenda I never heard or read any dumbass say that. If so they are exactly that... dumb.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@empowerme57 @Norvell @TalbertSwan We are going to need the Green Book again to tell us where it is safe for us to travel to.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@populistpapers2 @frankie5563 @justinhendrix LMAO, there it is. He can donate his presidential salary but he is making way more money every time he holds a rally or uses his golf course.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@morrthemerri_er @DonCheadle They will ignore it like they ignore all news they don't like<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frankie5563 @justinhendrix He's been making money off his presidency.  I wouldn't be surprised if he is rich only now because of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid People paid him to used the Trump name because they thought it meant something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MillAlwaysReady Can she reimburse the expenses during tax time?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@shaunking Gaga who? Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spiggeragenda That's crazy. I heard about this issue in India and many African countries but all the Jamaicans I know are proud.  I never knew. Thanks.  I hope it's a minority of folks.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@spiggeragenda I didn't know Jamaica is having this issue too. Wow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kaydyma @Luvvie Me too. I watched and went straight to Twitter for her breakdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skeefe54 @Artkos19 @EJmassage @EdgarAlanFro 🤣🤣 good point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itssgeorgia I love the message<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamieCinematics I hope they don't find out they are cousins. Lol. Kidding<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid I was cringing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kevin93527144 Hush your mouth.  🤪.  You're probably right though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kevin93527144 Well there is plenty of murder in this. Lol.  I don't have one set thing I like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kevin93527144 I did.  I had to laugh to mask the crying.  Luckily I'm only working with one person tonight.  He doesn't watch GoT so he doesn't understand.  Do you watch the show?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kevin93527144 Yes literally.  Tears out of my eyes while I'm at work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xrayvisionctm 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Artkos19 @EJmassage @EdgarAlanFro People drank wine and smoked cigarettes when they were pregnant in the 70s. I don't think they thought about the affects of alcohol in her time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zinfulzag @Bnice2468 @khalesus Dany can't fight either.  She has her dragons and that's it.  When she was on the battle field, she hid behind her protector.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimberlyNFoster I'm crying right now. It's so sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I won't spoil #GoT but I am crying right now over this death more than any others.  I know it's fictional, but damn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tyese_givens @Freeyourmindkid I understand.  When I first moved to Virginia I was like what did I get myself into.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@burgundybeast @realDonaldTrump Uh huh. Sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itssgeorgia When I was pregnant I wanted a girl to name her Medusa. I had a son.  I always liked her and her name.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Freeyourmindkid We had dial up AOL and I don't think there was a website for that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ShaquilleGMoore @Freeyourmindkid ONE YEAR LATER AT THE SAME EVENT. What don't you understand?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimonHowardSax1 @cryer_brandi @raccomrade So you were being sarcastic?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShaquilleGMoore @Freeyourmindkid You have bad reading comprehension. No one said blacks own marching bands or created this.  Taylor did the same thing 1 YEAR after Bey at the SAME event. Not from 1979 like you keep saying. It's a copy and sad. Maybe don't be so obvious with theft.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DomZenga @MarvelStudios Lol. Oh you mean that scene. I meant the other ones.  He made it back because he didn't time jump back. Instead he lived his life out and became an old man.  He went back then stayed in real time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Doctor_Cupcakes @chrisfwp27 @MarvelStudios @Doctor_Cupcakes he is definitely triggered.  He made more than one comment about her  https://t.co/l0pktatGbe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@teamster4obama @MarvelStudios His 'pee' scene made me laugh till I cried.  The only tears I she'd throughout the movie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DomZenga @MarvelStudios I'm with you. I keep thinking, how didn't this change the outcome when it should have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johncmiller96 @MarvelStudios I agree. I was hoping someone else would say it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@janicewebb86 @Freeyourmindkid Haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KyMass23 I found it. Never mind.  Very happy now. thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KyMass23 Is this Twitter?  You can mute words?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ozzyslovegirl They didn't miss it, they spoil it for their own amusements.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eiyann09 I saw it but I don't get the reference. It'll probably hit me in a few hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilysadams @msporcia34 @VanityFair *Not a spoiler The film had one guy saying he went on a date with another guy. That's about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NRA @ChrisCoxNRA LMAO.  Is this for real?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ehananoki @__gabbymiller Is this like Thomas  Jefferson who supposedly didn't like slavery, but kept them anyway and had children with his.  *this is the story they are even telling at the Monticello Museum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BiscuitsTheCat @CrispyClout @TheNuGeekz @Agromat_WoW @LordFonzz I didn't watch till the end.  Credit should be tagged in the post.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@987will @PrimeVideo That's probably why I'm the only person that liked The Watchmen.  I like the different aspect on superheroes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NiecyFBreezy @VICE Splinters in her lips<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NiecyFBreezy @VICE 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisEvans I won't spoil it. Well done #DontSpoilTheEndgame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrmickfran Lol. I didn't stay. I almost did<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Londel2 @Akshay__Jani I can't survive the next episode.  I'm going to need therapy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkRuffalo @MarvelStudios @RobertDowneyJr @chrishemsworth @Renner4Real Definitely sappy. I loved it still<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No spoilers. #AvengerEndgame was too sappy.  That is all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yashar #DerangedDonald<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wskrz @yashar #DerangedDonald<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Olas_Truth @chescaleigh At that point just 'select all' and delete<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Freeyourmindkid I would vote independent at this point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisEvans Can't wait to see it tomorrow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w_kago @Judicaelle_ @Kaone_SM ** I should say taboo not cliche. Sorry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w_kago @Judicaelle_ @Kaone_SM Ask for help. See a family counselor. Getting help is still a cliche and it needs to be addressed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Juscap84 @Judicaelle_ That's what I was thinking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kaine_uzama @theiykeibeh @Judicaelle_ The women commenting are speaking from experience. It's only common that we would insert ourselves in our reactions.  Most of the men commenting seem to think there's nothing wrong and everyone should stick it out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Freeyourmindkid You and Shaun King keep tweeting about him.  I'm not voting for him but damn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickyllos @CNNPolitics I love this gif.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nerdette @iLuvvit This is the real trickle down theory, not tax breaks for the rich.<|endoftext|>
