<|startoftext|>Been a while since I‚Äôve been in Montreal on #RemembranceDay.

<|startoftext|>@Mr_Stalter could you please add me. Would like to speak to you about the election and your concerns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The deportation saga has caused a huge split in the Chaldean community. While many still support the president, others are shifting their support despite their ultra-conservative values. I wrote about the trend for @TheNationalNews  https://t.co/OkrZWocsyl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In January he promised to put a stop to the detentions and deportations, but didn‚Äôt take any concrete action. A Chaldean community leader told me he‚Äôs disappointed no executive order was issued by #Trump ahead of the election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump appeals for the Iraqi Chaldean vote in #Michigan at his latest rally, despite his administration ordering the deportation of 1400+ of their members in 2017.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Many Arab Americans we spoke to in #Dearborn said they didn‚Äôt support either candidate and most likely wouldn‚Äôt vote in this election.  What was surprising was the many who said they supported President Trump and would vote for him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ash_Stewart_ Cringe. Though to be fair a decent response once he found the words.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh, this made me so mad. Why don't the police just stop, think, and ask questions. A so they arrest the right people and B so they don't further traumatize people simply asking for their help. This is what's wrong with law enforcement in the US.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope the crew is okay.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Here's a piece I produced for @CBCTheNational on the #Burundi refugees in 2015.  https://t.co/ElJo18roKG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I still get goose bumps when I watch this video @sophietremblay filmed as hundreds of refugees set sail towards the safer shores of #Tanzania.  https://t.co/o7Qv8lRWfl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad to see #Burundi finally holding elections. 5 years ago @sophietremblay and I traveled to a tiny strip of beach on the border of Burundi and #Tanzania where 1000s had fled out of fear of president #Nkurunziza. It remains one of the most powerful stories I've covered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don‚Äôt forget the people of Idlib. Great piece by @evanchill . Idlib Was Their Last Refuge. They Couldn‚Äôt Hide From the Bombs.  https://t.co/mygMWMpWrk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What it's like to be a frontline doctor fighting #COVID„Éº19 right now. Thank you Dr Maclolm Borg for letting @EricaEl_ and I follow you around and for the window into your world.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You have to love how creative Lebanese protesters are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's hard to comprehend how irresponsibly @MagufuliJP is handling pandemic.  After Imam closed major TZ mosque he said: "It's strange to stop believers from entering a mosque which they built themselves. If you fear going there, let others go and pray."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is concerning and unfortunately typical of the Magufuli government. #Tanzania #Covid_19<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I was able to film inside a #COVID„Éº19 ICU in #Dubai. Here‚Äôs what it looks like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I spent a few hours at a #COVID hospital in Dubai. A few take aways. -the drs, nurses and cleaning staff are heroes  -I didn‚Äôt realize how important the psychological aspects of treatment are -they said keeping patients upbeat is key    -it‚Äôs terrifying being so close 2 the virus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. This is horrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonVonBerg Take away is I can run with Boo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The numbers in the #UAE have been steadily rising for weeks now. The good news is, testing is widely available. Hopefully the curve starts to flatten soon. #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricaEl_ @TheNationalUAE That didn‚Äôt take you long!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ash_Stewart_ That's not social distancing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jongambrellAP What are you using? I'm rocking the a7 and find that happens as well. Try using the mechanical sensor cleaner in the functions tab between changing lenses. It shakes most of the dust away. It's definitely an annoying problem though.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thomasdaigle That was my first question when I saw they had done that. Thanks for looking into buddy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lizonomy Not that I know of. But I like the idea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alfahim29 My understanding is the actual test itself takes 4-6 hours. You have to factor in the time it takes to get the sample to the testing lab and any potential backlog there maybe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@folo1976 @TheNationalUAE Your too kind @folo1976<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got an early look at Abu Dahbi‚Äôs first drive-thru #Covid_19 testing site. It was quick, efficient and almost painless. #CoronavirusPandemic<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sayittwice_ Hey, I'm a video journalist with a newspaper in the UAE. did you film this? we'd like to use it in a video.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crazy statistic, which I think illustrates how seriously the #UAE is taking the threat of #COVID19. @AUH has administered more than 15,000 #coronavirus tests to incoming residents and visitors. That‚Äôs more than #NewYorkState.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@folo1976 @TheNationalUAE Thanks @folo1976<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Abu Dhabi Airport ‚Å¶@AUH‚Å© is taking extraordinary measures during the #COVID19 pandemic.

<|startoftext|>@CampbellMacD My man!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Interesting thread by @paul_salem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What‚Äôs happening in Idlib is unconscionable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Egyptian state TV is reporting that Hosni Mubarak is dead. The 91 year-ole ruled Egypt for nearly 3 decades until 2011. He was arguably the biggest political casualty of the Arab Spring. #egypt #mubarak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The hypochondriac in me did not enjoy making this video. #COVID19 #Coronavirius<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another harrowing report by @sommervilletv. Hard to imagine how frightening it must be for the people of #Idlib.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kshaheen @arwaCNN @gultuysuz Agreed. One of the best pieces I‚Äôve seen in ages.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Great pack on the legendary Jane Goodall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CampbellMacD That being said, you‚Äôre telling me no part of you wants to run 7 on 7? And I think you could actually do it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hard to believe it‚Äôs bee 15 years. I feel old.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always fun talking Lebanon and doing a podcast. Thanks @Sunniva_Rose for your analysis and @JHainesYoung for your knowledge.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@indrosphere Hi indrajit, I‚Äôm a journalist @TheNationalUAE did you film this yourself? I‚Äôd like to use it for a video about the snow in Baghdad. I would of course credit you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is really sad, but sadly not surprising. Like so many, I got my start interning @DailyStarLeb way back in 2008. I hope it‚Äôs online content continues to shed light on Lebanon and the region.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He got it right on second reference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markmackinnon I think he did. Though when I was just writing it on my phone, it tried to auto correct to that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump just mispronounced the Al Aqsa Mosque. He called it Al Aqua, I actually think that might have accidentally auto corrected in the prompter. Either way not a good look.<|endoftext|>
