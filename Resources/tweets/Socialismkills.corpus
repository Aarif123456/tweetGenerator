<|startoftext|>The minute @twitter blocks my account because I am speaking truth about the radical left pedophiles… As far as I’m concerned that’s an admission of guilt. And they can stop me from sounding off on Twitter but they can’t stop me from sounding off to the fucking world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The radical left have been kidnapping, sex trafficking, raping and killing our children to satisfy their sick perversions.  There is no age too young and nothing is off the table for them. They are all sick wicked fucking pedophiles. #NCSWIC Hell is to good for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The radical left pedophiles have a diaper fetish. The sick fuckers are a bunch of #pedophiles. we know everything and they know we know. #DiaperDonald #pedophilesburninhell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All ya’ll (radical left), are a bunch of fucking #pedophiles with a shitty diaper fetish. I mean fuck, we all know the sick shit you have been doing. Seriously we know everything. I bet they are all wearing diapers as we speak. Not joking. #DiaperDonald<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DiaperDonald the radical left is always accusing the right of exactly what they’re doing. This trending hashtag just proves the perverted radical left absolutely unequivocally has diaper fetishes. Which makes perfect sense, they’re all a bunch of fucking pedophiles. #NCSWIC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ProsecuteThugs I feel like it is probably much less than that. This election and the mail in games which are being played who’s to say if democrat votes were really cast for Biden? The way the congressional seats, state &amp; fed are turning red...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProsecuteThugs #citizenjournalists paying attention<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProsecuteThugs I disagree. I feel the nation is actually more united then ever. United against the lying msm and the pollsters.  We knew they were going to do this.

<|startoftext|>I live on an island which has a very diverse population. I love it. W/that being said, there is nothing which brings me more entertainment than the overly emotional reaction 2 #Trump, #SCOTUS, &amp; the retirement of a Supreme Court Judge. You can’t pay for this kinda entertainment!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So let’s take a moment to circle back. Do we all agree when the gov picks winners &amp; losers we all lose? Of course we do.  Should the free market pick winners &amp; losers? Yes! Should free men be forced to spend their hard earned money against their better interests? I say No! #KAG<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#NeverTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueFalcon3P  I don't read this stuff I got directly to the source. It has no agenda. The senate voting record site has fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueFalcon3P  I cannot change your mind only you can. I have got get some sleep I have class in the morning. Good night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueFalcon3P  The final vote is on record he voted NAY. He changed his vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWe25858900  We have come to an impasse. Maybe you should move on to someone who may be interested in your talking points<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueFalcon3P  Then you can truly decide if he really did vote the way you liked. Instead of taking someone's word that might have agenda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueFalcon3P  Also while you are there you can see his blotting record on all of the stuff floating in senate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueFalcon3P  Go through all of them yourself. Make sure you find the final vote on each bill. You will see he changed his vote to NAY.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ScottWe25858900  That is a pretty big gamble.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueFalcon3P  That is just not what happened. Hold on it is all on record. Give me a minute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueFalcon3P  Cruz voting is a matter of public record. If you give me a minute I can find you the link to senate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueFalcon3P  It is very easy for a person to twist things. Especially, when it comes to voting records in congress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueFalcon3P  Maybe you should take some time to actually check the senate vote record website. Just go to the source.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soxmom47  Right sure thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DREWDISCIPLE and he's not drunk. He is DEAD DRUNK! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BlueFalcon3P  You can go to the senate website and look at every vote cast. It is a matter of record.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueFalcon3P  At first then heard from his constituents and changed. It is that simple. He voted NAY.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueFalcon3P  He did what his constituents. They told him not to support so he changed. He did what Texas voters wanted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueFalcon3P  Please read it 2the full end. He voted NAY to TPP it is on record. He listened to his constituents.   https://t.co/NsjVJbWDou<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@no2libs007 it is not going to happen. Everyone hates him. So sorry to have to explain this reality to you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@no2libs007  Trump will lose the general. He runs a scorched earth campaign insults everyone then thinks people will support in the general<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigdaddydoggie @reardongalt  At that point the libertarians will be more closely aligned to me anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigdaddydoggie @reardongalt  I will vote just not for Trump or Hillary. There are other options ya know. I will vote libertarian.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWe25858900  He has no grasp on foreign policy at all! Have you read this transcript of Trump in his own words?  https://t.co/bekGR3xW4x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueFalcon3P  Would you like the link so you can read exactly how it went down. I have it right here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueFalcon3P  Actually he voted no on the TPA it is on record. He voted yes on the TAA which was a completely different thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarenMonsour12 @reardongalt  Just read this and tell me the guy has a grasp on anything? He is fucking nuts.  https://t.co/bekGR3xW4x<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KarenMonsour12 @reardongalt  Don't lecture me about party loyalty if Trump wins the nomination the GOP left me.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SandyPierce @howie_head @ImmoralReport @jan_pierce  Sometimes I like to confront them w/facts. I am sure it messes w/their heads a bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly, when I get a person on my TF talking trash I always look at their profile. Some are worth engagement.   https://t.co/UVU79WSMeE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SandyPierce @howie_head @ImmoralReport @jan_pierce  They set up one account after another. They search keywords. And attack people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SandyPierce @howie_head @ImmoralReport @jan_pierce  It served to reenforce what I already knew. Trump pays people to troll Twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SandyPierce @howie_head @ImmoralReport @jan_pierce  They were paid Trump staff. All they were doing was working on these computers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SandyPierce @howie_head @ImmoralReport @jan_pierce  I saw an image a few months back. It showed a room full of people on computers.<|endoftext|>
