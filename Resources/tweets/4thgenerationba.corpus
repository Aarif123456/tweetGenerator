<|startoftext|>@niks2mimi @qmanbeats @Endy_doc @__mp3__ @realDonaldTrump Biden is the godless one.

<|startoftext|>@Kiaxo_xo @TomiLahren You didn‚Äôt in 2016 and you were probably on tv crying. We actually got jobs and can‚Äôt afford to spend the day crying on the news<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JalilButera @TomiLahren Why couldn‚Äôt it be a woman with some dignity like @RealCandaceO who actually cares about African Americans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomiLahren It is, and they are saying this claim is disputed but there are a tone of videos on Facebook where the ballot ‚Äúcounters‚Äù are filling out multiple ballots and stamping them received. And why would Detroit need to block off the observers if they weren‚Äôt up to no good on the inside?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump There‚Äôs still hope more alDonaldTrump. There‚Äôs videos all over Facebook where people were filling out ballots when they were supposed to be counting them.

<|startoftext|>The riots would have been long gone by now if the democrats would grow up and take some damn responsibility. Antifa is nothing but fascist punks who can‚Äôt fight. They want to ‚Äúunify‚Äù the country but they destroyed a 9/11 memorial monument.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MrBeastYT That would be epic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump if you want to shut the Dems up put up a mandate forcing those states with low infection rates to open up local businesses and give them a small tax break based on the amount of employees during the pandemic. That should boost the unemployment back up<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Lost_Pause_ @YouTube How to get on vrchat?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheAn1meMan Is this accurate because I love this cover. And I might do a cover of both but don‚Äôt want to make myself look stupid. UNRAVEL - Tokyo Ghoul Opening 1 (English OP cover by Jonathan Young)  https://t.co/RAKWnWnDFD via @YouTube.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Lost_Pause_ That‚Äôs a cool thing to do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you know someone who is contemplating suicide talk to them. Or if they won‚Äôt talk to you personally call the suicide prevention hotline. Sometimes just a voice to talk to is all they need.  That‚Äôs not always going to be the case, but you have to try. We all do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>P.2 anyone who has a little bit of respect for other people would have cut the dead body from the video. Logan Paul‚Äôs video is almost like live-streaming a funeral where he‚Äôs joking about the suicide victim. Get a life Logan Paul<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>P.1 Logan Paul is an ass. Literally found a person who has Logan Paul‚Äôs suicide forest vlog. Logan, suicide is not a joke. Even if that is your way of releasing anxiety and stress, you can‚Äôt just make fun of the dead guy on camera. Imagine that being one of your friends or family<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Lost_Pause_  @akidearest @LilyFoxMechanic  @TheAn1meMan @Chronexia I can‚Äôt find this disturbing video y‚Äôall are talking about. Even so I agree with y‚Äôall completely. I have been a fan of the suicide forest since I first watched a documentary on it in 2011.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Who are you wanting to come back?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do still trust you. It takes a lot to destroy my trust<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe after a while<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thanks Rachelle and Anna for trying everyday to cheer me up after what all has gone on this week<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can't delete me, you can unfriend me but I'd still be able to message you. You had to have blocked me<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wow blocking me on Facebook talk about another stab in the back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But since you think I'm such a bad guy maybe McKenzie will treat you better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Besides for someone who cares about other people's feelings you sure neglected mine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's alright though because Wednesday I'm going to get wasted. Hopefully clear my mind and find someone who actually gives a damn about me<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Never meant to hurt your feelings, there was already so much shit going through your head<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I get it I should have asked you about the god damn rumor instead. I'm sorry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And my scars remind me that the past is realI tear my heart open just to feel- papa roach<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Life is a bullet  The bloodstains prove it - Papa Roach<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That last one was by disturbed<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If this is living, what the hell is living for? You've boarded up your eyes, your mind has locked the door -Megadeth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trust me I know that feeling too so many people are asking about what happened but I don't want to tell anyone what went down<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah I know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe but I don't want no one else<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unfortunately I didn't have any gas this no job thing is only adding extra stress But I get paid in 12 minutes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That horrifying thought came in the nick of time too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I ve contemplated it but then I realized there would be no chance of getting to see you again afterwards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I owe your friend for not letting you do it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know even though we aren't together at the moment that would literally kill me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I saw right through it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know I miss you and care about you. I know you do too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd be happy to share<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too of course the demons are arguing with the angels throwing my mind in a loop<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You don't have to be. And trust me mine  ain't much different<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I bet given the chance I could but there's a lot going through that mind of yours<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've known you for pretty much my whole time in this town. Maybe not bf/gf the whole time but still have known you that long ur not a whore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You might lie about feeling fine but your not the only one who does. My parents know I'm not fine just by looking at me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know one that would have been really hard on you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not true you are good at making people happy don't even think about me think of all the chaos your friends would have caused if not For you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That isn't true and you know it. OMG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to work on getting back in shape I'm tired of being fat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You aren't a whore. Your a young woman<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm trying my damnedest to keep from being creepy like the other guy and I can tell I'm failing you so I'm sorry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was probably the best thing to happen to me in the last decade. Not graduating or getting my DL but those few months<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish I could go back in time to 12/14/2015  and record ever detail up till Monday and put it on loop like youtube<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm just hoping it's all a bad dream or something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I now I should man up but holding in this pain is killing me. I haven't just lost the best thing to ever happen to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I didn't want it to end, and now I see this emoji pillow and I just want to cry more.<|endoftext|>
