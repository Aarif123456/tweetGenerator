<|startoftext|>Very true. We should put pressure on the midfielders and give a break to front 3! Ridiculous 12 goals from all midfielders, 6 from shaqiri alone, who is not played by klopp either. City have 44 goals from mid. Henderson ZERO! #LFC #Klopp #Salah #LIVEVE #EPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The difference between klopp and a title winning manager is that the latter one would have played for a draw in the city fixture, be happy with 7pt lead and built pressure on city. A win for them has turned things around. Sometimes defense is the best attack.#salah<|endoftext|>
