<|startoftext|>Some places are definitely using covid as an excuse for crap service. Also, some pubs/restaurants are making up the rules on alcohol as they go along. 1 drink only with a meal, errrr, where does it say that in the Government rules? Nowhere! Had to make a point to get a 2nd. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glasterlaw1 People are losing the plot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yrhaul @SkyNews People can still be careful. They don’t have to go crazy. It’s like ppl need their hand held for everything now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glasterlaw1 Exactly. But according to some, it’s nothing to do with people 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As soon as there’s a Tory MP that goes against Boris on Brexit, @BBCNews have them straight on. They’re so transparent in their bias. I bloody hate the media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPJHodges He never won it fairly to start with<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattybooboo75 Yes, but only at Christmas 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brexitparty_uk @LSadler16861851 @Nigel_Farage Just repeat what Boris is doing, but attack him and say he’s going to cave then? I think I’ll give your attention seeking a miss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamCoatesSky It’s cos the true spread is mixing in homes. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have much looser restrictions than places like Germany, who are going into a hard lockdown over Xmas. Whatever the UK Government does, some will hate it. But Government was never going to do nothing, so we shouldn’t be surprised with Tier 3, now that people are mixing in homes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FKEU8 So what should they do? Nothing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarlaSpade Have you seen Wales? Cases are spiralling there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrDanCarroll You’re debating yourself as I agree on hospitality. BUT, they always said they wouldn’t want to close schools, so was always going to come down to hospitality if people stopped abiding by social distancing in homes, having gatherings/parties etc .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrDanCarroll Can hardly report every insta post I see can I 🙄 I don’t particularly agree with closing hospitality, but as it’s basically the only thing left they can control, then it was obvious they would. Hence why people should have followed the rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GayToryJon I agree, I don’t think closing hospitality is the answer. But it’s the only thing the Government can control, so obvious it’s the thing they will do if cases rise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrDanCarroll That’s rubbish. I know tons of ppl myself, and I don’t know thousands of ppl, let alone millions. The newspapers arnt in people’s homes are they, they arnt going to be peeping through the curtains either. To say that what I see, isn’t happening is ridiculous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s a mixture of it all now. There’s no easy answer anymore, if there ever was. I don’t think these restrictions are going to help much though, as it will drive people indoors to party and socially mix. Mess!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillyCarrollGB @EssexPR It’s what those secondary school kids do after school is the issue. They are mixing far more outside of school then in it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR Personally, I wouldn’t close hospitality. I don’t think that will help now that it’s all going on in homes, however, the Government will want to be seen to be doing everything it can. However small. Sometimes it’s just the optics that makes people think 🤷🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR I don’t believe it’s hospitality Adam. I’ve always said I think it’s house parties, gatherings in homes etc. I know people doing it, that’s why it spreads. We are at the point where many are breaking the rules, it doesn’t take much to rise then. I don’t know what the Gov can do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know TONS of people who are having house-parties, doing social gatherings &amp; are breaking all the social distancing rules. I also see gangs of secondary age kids in the streets. THIS is why cases rise &amp; why the Government has to introduce horrid Tier 3 restrictions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let’s be serious, we all hate Tier 3 &amp; lockdowns. But let’s be realistic, the Government doesn’t have much choice if cases start spiralling. What I don’t understand, is why people have ignored the rules when they were there to avoid tighter restrictions being enforced.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Geordi_kev_ Clearly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Definitely them. Huge spike coincides.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When it comes to #Covid_19, the fact remains that actions have consequences, it’s as simple as that. Too many #COVIDIOTS about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lord_Sugar Go Sugar!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@montie To make a point and appear to be whiter than white. Which we all know is bullsh*t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrDanCarroll It won’t be just spreading at school, it will likely be down to the secondary school- aged children hanging out after school in gangs, I’ve seen it in my own area. That is the issue. You can close the schools, but if they all hang out not socially distanced, it spreads.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s the issue isn’t it, some people don’t abide by the rules and then people wonder why the Government is forced to intervene with restrictions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like London is heading for Tier 3 then. That’s not good for anybody, let alone the economy and jobs. I just can’t understand how cases are rising so dramatically in #London, if everyone is following the rules.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@manorsteps Don’t blame you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SirRogerGale He can’t just agree to anything the EU says. Taking a position like that is untenable. I find your stance extremely disappointing and quite frankly unacceptable in its timing. Boris can’t magic up a good deal if the EU are unwilling to give one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Morning twitter!! Are we feeling Monday? I’m not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_HelenDale Labour are in charge there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Labour Party don’t represent the working class or any class for that matter. They don’t represent British people full stop. They only represent themselves. Unelectable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just seen that Germany is going into a hard lockdown over the Christmas period. The new lockdown will run from 16 December to 10 January. Yikes! Smack bang over Christmas. France has quite tough restrictions too. Glad the UK is less restricted, but people must use common sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>6 Christmas films watched so far, keep them coming! #feelingfestive 🎅🏼 ⛄️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Predictable that remainers are constantly in meltdown on twitter over #NoDealBrexit threat from Boris. On the other side we have @Nigel_Farage &amp; some leavers, who are hoping that Boris caves (to prove them right), constantly beating the drum that he will fail. Pathetic! He won’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage The date is moving, it’s still the 31 Dec. So what exactly is being kicked down the road? You’ve become solely intent on just attention, nothing more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SiobhanBenita We already left! 🤣🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RuleBrexitannia No he hasn’t. Just because he’s letting talks continue for a few more days, changes nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour’s failure is everywhere to see, on a daily basis. They are the same unelectable party they’ve been for the last decade.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lancs_Lad61 Like that one! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a crap result. Should have done better Spurs! #CRYTOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What’s the first word that comes to mind when somebody says no deal?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hear @piersmorgan said he put a mask on seconds later, not really good enough though is it. Damage is already done by being in the car without the mask. Another one who tested positive for hypocrisy. Maybe he should have a few weeks with the lions in Africa too...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So what’s Corbyn’s big announcement, did I miss it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Personally, not sure what benefit there is to keep talks going when there doesn’t appear to be any progress. However, if @BorisJohnson thinks it’s worth trying, then keep going. We have nothing to lose. At the end of the day, there’s only 19 days left, trade deal or no deal 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bit merry but definitely missing my drunken Christmas nights out. Bring on normality in 2021.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Except in Labour, NOTHING has changed. Nothing has changed on antisemitism, Labour are still anti-British, there’s no leadership, you still want to bow to all of the EU demands on a trade deal, still weak on crime and Labour constantly sit on the fence with decisions. Pathetic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@topdog19800 @BorisJohnson Covid did that you idiot, most of that money was for furlough and business grants. Half the country would be unemployed without that and majority of businesses would have gone bust without it.  You want most ppl unemployed do you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNpensionguru @BritishAlba @BorisJohnson Scotland voted to stay part of the UK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JC_free82 Many reasons. It’s been a crazy year with covid, and whatever he or the Government did, wasn’t going to please everybody. In my view they have tried to balance health with the economy as best they can, much better than Labour’s Wales. They’ve delivered Brexit, are investing etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems the Supreme Court in America is just as bad as they were here last year...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tjsrichman @DeborahMeaden I hope it does 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sure is!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JC_free82 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeborahMeaden Bye then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HHepplewhite Won’t happen though! What a mess<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@earl_n17 @ColinDa19415235 @BorisJohnson You drunk again?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ghost_wales @alastairdick A great night. I got so pissed I got lost on the way home and smashed my phone 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fight must go on! America should be proud of Trump, whatever happens. Nobody can say he hasn’t stood up for the people of 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicolaCatt @HelenDrummond19 @LBC @IainDale Yes it was. Unless you were living under a rock. If you knew that, why do you think others didn’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @IainDale He’s delivering, especially after a global pandemic has really gotten in the way of clear plans. Clearly the pandemic has taken the priority, but many things like Brexit have continued.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@preshitorian How pathetic, disrespectful and inaccurate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer He can’t just sign any deal that gives the EU control over the UK. I know Labour would sign over all the power in this country to Brussels, but the Conservatives won’t. If it ends up #NoDealBrexit, so be it! Better that than a rubbish trade deal that means we are bound to the EU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Drakeford has admitted coronavirus is spreading "faster than all our models have predicted", adding that it is now "firmly entrenched in many parts of Wales". No shit after the mess Labour have created. This is Labour in Wales with 3m ppl, imagine them UK wide with England’s 56m.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeborahMeaden You can’t be that stupid surely? One was the withdrawal agreement, the other trade. Separate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage @BorisJohnson Yet you’ll still carry on with a new party...🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wales🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 has by far the highest coronavirus infection rate of any part of the UK (Over 400 per 100k) and a coronavirus death rate significantly higher than anywhere else in the UK. When are Labour and @MarkDrakeford going to admit they messed up?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCPolitics @bbcnickrobinson Get stuffed!! Labour always digging at Britain, which is why they will remain in opposition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Busiest I’ve seen London since March. Packed compared to this years norm, empty compared to this time last year though....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s good to have strong opinions. Never be afraid to say them and stand your ground if needed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Strange how the UK🇬🇧 has signed 50+ trade deals around the world, yet the EU can’t seem to do one with us. I’m sure the EU said we’d struggle to do deals around the world so quickly, seems the EU underestimated us. They also thought @BorisJohnson would cave in to their demands...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BritainElects @Survation If the Conservatives are ahead at this stage, and next year the only way is up, I can’t see Labour mounting much of a comeback.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After the facts that I see in front of me and the way the EU are acting, I believe it is now time to end the trade deal talks, walk away and go with WTO terms.   It comes a time when you have to say enough is enough. 🇬🇧 #NoDealBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afneil A labour government woudl agree to anything they asked<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like they buried most pro Trump and anti Biden news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I grew up with Barbara Windsor on my TV screens most days as Peggy, very sad to see she’s died. RIP Barbara ❤️  Thoughts are with everyone who has lost somebody this year. It’s been a tragic year in so many ways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dollmay10 Sorry for your loss, it’s awful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anne_mummag I’ll drink to that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sqlblues Well we make sure we do it British style. All cheese I buy is either Welsh or English.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The media are doing their usual scaremongering tactics. They did the same during the referendum. Pathetic MSM as usual....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remainers are out in force I see, tweeting the usual Boris bashing hashtag. This time it’s #BorisHasFailedTheNation. Shock.   A more accurate one I’ve come up with is #BorisHasMadeTheNationProud 🇬🇧 We left the EU as promised &amp; only 3 weeks until we’ve left the transition period!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vivjones10 Dialogue yes, but some of the themes are true. The whole Camilla thing was always true. Even Diana admitted in an interview there were 3 in their marriage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarolPP9 Did Charles not cheat with Camilla, is he not now married to Camilla, did Diana not say in an interview there was 3 in their marriage? All 3 are correct. Not totally inaccurate then is it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vivjones10 I do know it’s not fully factual he’s, as my 2nd tweet said. Though Diana was by far better than the rest in my opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To all those saying it’s fiction, some parts yes, but what I just stated was not fiction. Diana was a class above them all, I saw that back then, as did many, and I never liked Charles cos of Camilla.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNewsBreak I think you’re forgetting Wales, which is actually far higher.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dpjermy It’s not all fiction though, Diana admitted some of it herself. He was vile, he was always cheating with Camilla.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watching the Crown and I really dislike Charles. To be honest, I did back then, but Diana was always a class above them all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a ridiculous proposal. Labour &amp; Plaid are as bad as each other. Between them, they just want us all tee total &amp; sober all through Christmas. This isn’t covid related, it’s control. Soon the Labour led Welsh Government (with plaid propping them up) is destroyed, the better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad to see @Conservatives politely telling the EU that they can shove their proposed deal where the sun don’t shine. I hope we also tell them to shove their demands on fishing water access for a full year in the event of no deal, where the sun don’t shine. Arrogance personified<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If there is no trade deal, then so be it. If it happens, the EU should have NO access to our waters for fishing. Sheer arrogance in them demanding a years full access, AFTER the transition period, is ridiculous. Power hungry, inflexible, unelected &amp; corrupt. The EU can push off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EuroGuido No, the transition period would have ended and so does the EU’s access to our waters. If there’s no deal, there’s no access. As the EU said, can’t just cherry pick what you want. Arrogant twa*s.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wesstreeting Typical Labour abuse. You know what you are @wesstreeting? A BULLY. This tweet is exactly bully boy tactics on social media. Should be disgusted by yourself. This only encourages some to bully others. This is the Labour Party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nicely said Rupert.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KayBurley Still trying to make out you though at the time you weren’t breaking the rules. You knew the rules and purposely broke them. Sorry, don’t buy this waffle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only country in the world that has approved a vaccine and is rolling it out, is the UK. A country that left the EU as promised and within weeks, leaves the transition period.   I’d say Boris Johnson is leading the country quite well thanks. Labour doesn’t have any leadership.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimothyBoyle9 @bbclaurak @BorisJohnson @DavidGHFrost HS2 helps grow the economy, productivity etc. If the economy is bigger, more money to put into things, which means Wales gets a portion of that. It’s the bigger picture. Wales woudl be worse off independent, fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JillGore8 You do realise that 90% of the trade deal is done, and many compromises have been made. What’s left are the critical bits relating to sovereignty, which can’t really move much. Also it’s not about having all the benefits, it’s about having a Canada style trade deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimothyBoyle9 @bbclaurak @BorisJohnson @DavidGHFrost What a load of rubbish. You do realise, Wales gets given more per head than England? It does benefit. Vanity projects as you put it help the UK economy, which helps Wales. What Wales needs is being rid of Labour holding it back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimothyBoyle9 @bbclaurak @BorisJohnson @DavidGHFrost Wales is part of the UK. I think Wales is better as part of that, it also benefits from it, both for security reasons but also financially.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimothyBoyle9 @bbclaurak @BorisJohnson @DavidGHFrost UK independence yes, I don’t believe wales should be independent of the UK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimothyBoyle9 @bbclaurak @BorisJohnson @DavidGHFrost Dream on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afneil @SaltyDuchess Trump got the highest amount of votes ever for a republican. Millions more than 2016. No republican is going to beat that. Biden got 7m more votes, but what decided it was about 250k votes, and fraudulent ones way more than that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Oh give it a rest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anybody noticed a remainer meltdown on twitter tonight?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let’s hope it goes somewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To those still not getting this, we ALREADY left the EU in January. We are no longer in the EU, but in the transition period. That ends on 31 Dec, no ifs, no buts. Ideally, we’d agree a trade deal, but likely, we will leave the transition period with no trade deal. It’s over. 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh look, Boris didn’t cave. I know that will disappoint many, who clearly want him to crumble, just so they can say they were right all along.   Boris hasn’t broken any of his promises on Brexit. We left in Jan, as promised. The transition period wasn’t extended, as promised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lloydda02708611 @BBCBreaking Yup. So corrupt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvguenieS @bbclaurak @BorisJohnson @DavidGHFrost We are still abiding by the EU rules at present, but yes we will have freedom on 1 Jan. A trade deal woud benefit the EU as well, but if one can’t be done, then so be it. The EU will suffer as well without one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCBreaking Coincidentally after the election, after the media and tech giants said it wasn’t true before the election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@objectivegreen @bbclaurak @BorisJohnson @DavidGHFrost Do you think it right that the EU can dictate British rules?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dermotg @objectivegreen @bbclaurak @BorisJohnson @DavidGHFrost I said Canada style. It shows that it is possible to have a good trade deal, without being in the EU. Why can’t we have the same? Yes, there are bespoke elements, but the EU arnt getting the basics that we have to be able to dictate rules in our own country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are some remainers in this country,l that are just so anti British. If you hate Britain so much, why are you here? All Britain wanted was a Canada style trade deal, that shouldn’t be impossible if the EU weren’t actually being inflexible. They are. They are being difficult.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@objectivegreen @bbclaurak @BorisJohnson @DavidGHFrost All we are asking for is a Canada style trade deal. Last I saw, Canada wernt in the EU. Are they using the facilities as you say? Get real. No point leaving if we can be still dictated by EU rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@akriggmag @bbclaurak @BorisJohnson @DavidGHFrost They have compromised on much of the trade deal. Remember, around 90% of the trade deal has been done, but there are a few elements that remain. Those are the bits that arnt really easy to compromise on, otherwise we aren’t really independent and in control.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MHristo @bbclaurak @BorisJohnson @DavidGHFrost 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@akriggmag @bbclaurak @BorisJohnson @DavidGHFrost You don’t know all that. Plus, what’s your recommendation, give the EU everything they want and have they dictate UK rules from the EU?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Roll on Sunday. That must be the last day, and we then walk away if there is no trade deal that meets our requirements. Thanks to @BorisJohnson &amp; @DavidGHFrost for everything they have done &amp;  trying so hard. We must not forget that the EU are inflexible and don’t respect us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbclaurak It’s ain’t going to happen, I respect @BorisJohnson and @DavidGHFrost for trying so hard, but it’s the same inflexible EU we are dealing with, they don’t respect we want true independence and sovereignty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbclaurak Do tell? 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Keep fighting Trump, it says a lot about who you are that you haven’t given up on trying to fight for a fair election, both now and in the future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 @Tom_Slater_ She’s a hypocrite. Period. Spent most of the year attacking others, and then breaks the rules herself. Also, why shouldn’t she be suspended? She’s meant to set an example being in the public eye and working for the media. What kind of public message does that send?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 @BorisJohnson Bit low. He’s still outside, posing for a pic for starters. Secondly, it’s a private jet. We have seen Boris constantly wear a mask, so this is a bit pathetic. He’s off on behalf of Britain ,against a corrupt EU, he needs us behind him, not throwing digs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Key is making sure everyone is aware that it is LABOUR who are destroying Wales &amp; that it’s ok to stop voting for them. Labour take Welsh votes for granted, thinking people will always vote for them cos their family always has. The lock needs to be broken. Wales🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 deserves better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FacundoSavala Most definitely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whether you voted remain or leave, whether you agree with us leaving in Jan or not, this is Britain 🇬🇧 &amp; we should be proud of our country. We have so much to be proud of, so much history, so much culture. We will prosper outside the EU, trade deal or no deal. Be positive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer What an absolute load of rubbish. Delivered on Brexit in Jan, when we left. Standing up for British sovereignty now and leaving transition period on 31 Dec. Most covid tests being done here than any other country in Europe, first country in the world to roll out vaccines....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The best deal I can think of is being rid of the EU &amp; it’s rules. Being able to do things the British🇬🇧 way, not the EU🇪🇺 way. That will happen regardless of any deal.

If we need to walk away, we will. Boris is trying to get a deal &amp; showing good faith in doing so.   I’m with Boris 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelRMilton2 A friend wanted some advice on fences, thought he might be handy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anybody seen Keir Starmer? #WhereIsGeneralIndecision<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notadoomster So what exactly do you think the Government is getting out of all this? The economy being trashed, people losing their jobs etc etc. If you think the Government wants this, you’ve lost it mate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notadoomster After 12 wks, we had turned the tide. The summer was mostly flat for cases, hence rules were relaxed &amp; things were a lot more normal. We could have avoided a 2nd lockdown if EVERYONE had followed the rules. They didn’t. Once vaccines are rolled out, things will go back to normal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notadoomster @NWJK @DPJHodges Flu hasn’t spread this yr the same as normal because people are not mixing as much and are wearing masks. It’s not all one big conspiracy 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notadoomster @DPJHodges So you don’t believe any lockdown has pushed cases down and prevents any deaths? That’s mathematically impossible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notadoomster And you might not have. What’s your point? You can’t go around having huge parties. Some people have sacrificed a lot this yr, it’s selfish for a minority few to mess it all up by having huge parties. I don’t agree with lockdowns anymore, but we do still need to use common sense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notadoomster @DPJHodges Saying it hasn’t worked is a bit disingenuous. If it hadn’t worked, deaths would be far far higher. It’s clear from the data lockdowns do push cases down, but they aren’t a solution long term and the vaccine should prevent any more. The second one was due to Christmas being close<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPJHodges Or the fact people aren’t following the rules.... 🤷🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is brilliant news. You have to provide ID for some basic things like picking up a parcel, so I think it’s fair to ask people to provide ID to vote in this country. Good move!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adsantweets Well they clearly do push cases down, as that is evident from the data. Long term, they don’t work no, as cases shoot back up after them. However, if you’re doing it for a reason, like pushing cases down before Christmas, Labour in Wales messed it all up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With covid cases In Wales🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿(as well as deaths) the highest in the UK, nearly double that of England🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 &amp; cases rising sharply (compared to falling in 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 ), it’s clear the Labour led Welsh Government have truly fuc*ed up. They mismanaged &amp; miss-timed the firebreak for Christmas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cmochri1 @richie_1994wale Badly done, badly timed. Christmas is a mere few weeks away, so Labour messed it all up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is it still so foggy? Is there anybody out there?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What he said👇🏼 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The covid infection rate (even with an alcohol ban in pubs) is nearly double in #Wales, what it is in #England. On average, it is approx. 150 cases per 100k in England🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 . In Wales🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 it is nearly 300 cases per 100k. Labour’s @MarkDrakeford has made a mess! Miss-timed everything!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulBrandITV Tell her to do one Boris, if they haven’t changed their stance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aljan06 @SkyNews Does anybody know what China does? I wouldn’t believe anything they say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very true. No other credible party was willing or able to deliver on the will of the people. Labour ignored the people, pushing for another vote, to hopefully change the result. The  @Conservatives &amp; @BorisJohnson delivered on their promise to Get Brexit Done &amp; we left the EU 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did you know the oven ready deal was about the withdrawal agreement (WA) and leaving in January?  Or did you think it also covered the trade deal, that nobody had even discussed at the time....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The ‘Oven Ready Deal’ was about the withdrawal agreement, as James Cleverly said. Trade couldn’t be discussed until we had left, which we did in January, as promised by Boris. Any TV presenter or remainer now saying it was about trade, is a blatant LIAR. You can’t rewrite history<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan We were told several times that trade couldn’t be discussed until we had left the EU. James Cleverly is spot on! What is disingenuous, is that Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid are now blatantly lying to the public, trying to say the oven ready deal was about a trade deal. Disgusted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You couldn’t negotiate a trade deal until we had left the EU, so impossible for it to be about trade. So no, we didn’t all assume oven ready deal was about a trade deal AT ALL. Absolute nonsense from @piersmorgan, as usual. Trying to re-write history. James Cleverly was right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitAlex Rather than wait to see if true, you promote EU sources, yet claim to dislike the EU? 🙄 fake news!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody pass the coffee!! ☕️ #workingfromhome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good, well done @JamesCleverly. About time people started standing up to Piers Morgan. Absolute disgusting man, completely arrogant and self serving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>James Cleverly is exactly right, people who are now saying the Conservatives promised an oven ready trade deal, are either ignorant or dishonest.   The oven read deal was the withdrawal agreement, which allowed us to leave in January, as promised by the @Conservatives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The UK🇬🇧 has made trade deals with many countries so far this year, but yet are struggling to make a deal with the EU. It’s because the EU have so far been threatening, inflexible &amp; have had no intention of giving us a good deal. Will it change? Doubtful. If not, no deal it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He would be correct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh no doubt. @Nigel_Farage would also love Boris to fail, as it’ll boost his new party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tmc51530213 It’s not true. No10 has denied it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CznOfEverywhere @SkyNewsBreak Fake news<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Said the EU only. @SkyNews the EU’s mouthpiece it seems. Didn’t even check from UK sources before breaking fake news<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage No, it’s EU lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Smells fishy to me....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pcastine @robertsessford1 @DavidLammy The oven ready deal was the withdrawal agreement, not the trade deal 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is Labour for you folks, liars! Lying through their back teeth. The ‘oven ready’ deal was the withdrawal agreement &amp; that was true. We left the EU in January. What is happening now is the trade deal, completely different. You couldn’t begin the trade deal, until we’d left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a bad Sunday....  Have an extra long sleep ☑️  Send the flatmate out to get food and drinks ☑️  Get the place all Christmassy ☑️  Shower ☑️  Gym ❌ Get ready for the Spurs v Arsenal match ☑️   Lazy Sunday 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour are delusional. Footballers, as well as others can support racial equality WITHOUT supporting a left wing, Marxist political movement. Black Lives Matter are violent, throw bikes at horses, loot, burn flags and try to tear down historic statues. I don’t support BLM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🇬🇧👍🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is sad to see. I always watch new episodes, but I’m not watching this. It’s meant to be a comedy, not a party political broadcast by the left wing Marxists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melindiscott @alastairdick This is very disappointing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pathetic nobodies desperate for attention is my first thought.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mancman10 Black Lives Matter IS the political movement. You can support racial equality yes, but not BLM, which is what the players are kneeling for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a new found fondness for Millwall fans. Fans of other teams need to take some of the spirit &amp; courage they had, &amp; do exactly the same thing. Black Lives Matter is a left wing political movement. They are violent, tried to burn our flag🇬🇧, loot &amp; tear down our statues ❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We will never forget.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What London needs is a new Mayor. One that actually doesn’t fail at everything, doesn’t miss targets, doesn’t blame all their failures on others, doesn’t bankrupt TfL and isn’t woke, with the desire to tear down our historic statues. London needs to vote for @ShaunBaileyUK! #marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This👇🏼  I’m proud of Millwall fans, it’s about time people stood against this woke nonsense. Most normal people in this country do not support this nasty, divisive, Marxist political movement that is ‘BLM’.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HHepplewhite I actually found it really funny; but if it’s turned to woke nonsense and BLM stuff, I’ll be switching it off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quite disgusting how some people on TV have described Millwall fans, just cos they booed players taking the knee. It wasn't shocking to see, at least not to most normal people. Some people seem to have been living in bubbles this year, but football fans hate this woke nonsense.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BritainElects @OpiniumResearch Hardly groundbreaking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCNews Completely disagree!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m a proud Brexiteer &amp; proud to be British. I know that will trigger some, but I couldn’t be more happy that the great United Kingdom🇬🇧 voted to leave the power hungry, inflexible, threatening &amp; bureaucratic EU. I’m chuffed @BorisJohnson is standing up for us &amp; standing firm!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has he caved yet? No. If he was going too, he would have by now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boris hasn’t crumbled &amp; hasn’t given the EU everything they’ve asked for. In fact, he has stayed very firm and is making sure that we truly do get a proper independent Brexit. Talks continue tomorrow, but if no movement, I feel we’ll walk away next week. Thanks @BorisJohnson 🇬🇧👍🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No trade deal it is then. I’m sick of the EU and their threats. They’ve been so inflexible in these trade negotiations, I feel we should just draw that line now and move on. I feel next we will. Well done @BorisJohnson, for staying so firm to date.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Totally agree with this. Roll on spring next year!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vivjones10 Fans don’t feel heard though, so unless football clubs stop this none sense, fans will get more and more fed up of it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great to see football fans back in stadiums today. A small number, but a great start and a positive step. Thanks @BorisJohnson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad to see many football fans do not support players taking the knee. Black Lives Matter is a Marxist political movement, that I, and many others can not support.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 @jamesinsurrey And if they hadn’t voted for them and deaths and cases had started to spiral (as they have in wales), then they’d have been blamed for more deaths. The Government and MPs can’t win. Damned if they do, damned if they don’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely right! After a dreadful year, people will not accept compromise that means Britain doesn’t take full control back. We would rather a no deal scenario than buckle to remainers (who still don’t accept the result) and those in the EU making unreasonable demands/threats 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The EU clearly do not want a deal. They are not budging on key things that need to be met for the UK🇬🇧 to be an independent country.

<|startoftext|>@zarahsultana Not quite like that. It’s for work purposes, and there are many changes to quarantine. With the economy badly affected, I’d welcome any news that makes it easier for businesses to get back on track.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrahamAllen_1 Is there time?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤞🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So glad to have @pritipatel as Home Sec. Some things may be slower than we’d like, but things are getting done. Some of the biggest raids ever, criminals are being deported and work continues on the illegal boats issues. I dread to think what it would be like under Labour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ghost_wales Jeez, things must have really gone down hill haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidLammy Omg, this must be a joke. Under Labour, nobody would get justice, nobody would face prosecution, criminals would be allowed to stay in Britain and run riot. The Labour Party is not the party for justice, law and order or anything really.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*pretends to be shocked*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shouldn’t people get the job, because they are the best person for it and did the best in the interview?   It’s wholly unfair that the best person for the job doesn’t get it, because they don’t fit the targets set for gender and BAME. Ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer Manchester has been held back in Tier 3 because the Labour Mayor @AndyBurnhamGM played political games in Sept, delaying them going into tighter restrictions then, that would have helped them longer term. Businesses would now be in Tier 2, like Liverpool, if it weren’t for Andy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Glad to see most supermarkets have now handed back business rate relief money to the Government, totalling circa 2billion. That will greatly help Britain going forwards in a post covid, post Brexit era. No doubt it will Britain level up across the country 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I fully support this crackdown, as will the majority of the country. I can guarantee you those who won’t support it though, Labour!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer In your eyes, the Government must intervene on everything. You attack the Government for business closures, the economic consequences of lockdowns etc, but you want a never ending lockdown. Labour in Wales have banned alcohol in pubs and closed them from 6. Labour have no clue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No surprise though is it. The media have been a disgrace most of this year in peddling false news, inaccurate stories and being completely biased in their reporting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tonysmi91701776 They also have to close by 6pm, that’s when most people finish work. It’s impossible for them in Wales.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The ban on alcohol in Labour led Wales🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 is absolutely bonkers. That’s not covid restrictions, that’s control of what people can buy. I do hope Labour lift the ban on review a week before Christmas, as those businesses need to be allowed time to recoup some lost earnings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems #Brexit negotiations has stalled because of the French determination to prevent British competitiveness and not give us full control of our waters. Britain should not falter in our position, so the time has come to end the talks if the EU won’t budge. No deal under WTO. 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer You’re a joke!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UKLabour But you wanted longer and harder lockdowns, so how would Labour have not let Britain down? Desperation. The Tories have done better than Labour would have ever done. Labour have banned the sale of alcohol in Wales, imagine that in England too. Be no business left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UKLabour The UK will rebound under the Conservatives, as it always does. First country to get a vaccine, the Conservatives have not let Britain down.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sore losers. Everything is better the British way. That’s why we left. 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In England, Tories have tried to balance the economy &amp; health. The tiered restrictions are designed to open up the economy, but control the virus, based on how bad it is in an area. In Labour led Wales, Labour just love power &amp; control. Banning alcohol in pubs is part of that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Labour led Welsh Government brings in a total ban on alcohol sales in pubs, bars &amp; restaurants tomorrow. That’s no alcohol at any time in these venues. Most will just close. Labour have not held a vote on it, pure dictatorship. England are lucky to have the Conservatives.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Motherfudgey Lying about what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@expostie3 We have left the EU, FACT, but we still abide by EU rules until 31 Dec as part of the transition period. So no, they are not lying, we have already left. The transition period is just following their rules while we do a trade deal, while OUTSIDE the EU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mckinlay_liz Only Government of liars is the one in Scotland, led by Nicola Sturgeon. Higher rate of covid than in England, higher deaths in care-homes, lies on the Salmond case. Maybe have a closer look at home. Take care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer Your plan is a never ending lockdown, don’t think that’s going to help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In 29 days, we will be out of the transition period. Brexit has happened &amp; we will leave that transition period with or without a deal on 31 December. The left can get #ToryLies trending, but it remains the fact the Tories have stayed true to their word. 🇬🇧 #downingstreetbriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour and the left hate success don’t they. As soon as there’s something positive in the news, like the fact the UK is the first country to approve a vaccine today, #ToryLies starts trending. Absolutely pathetic.

<|startoftext|>@ChrisDo30828241 It’s the first batch you absolute idiot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeoplesMomentum Doesn’t work like that. The economy had grown 🙄 Plus, this is a completely different situation. This wasn’t down to day to day overspend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@starukkiwi You do realise Boris is PM and does go on visits abroad, don’t you? It’s not just Starmer abstaining, he ordered his party too. Bit different to anybody with half a brain cell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PippaCrerar Call yourself a journalist! 😂 Labour activist more like!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad we are in the midst of a pandemic, severely impacting on health &amp; the economy. However, if there is one party who can get us through, it’s the @Conservatives with @BorisJohnson. Tories will get the economy back on track, whilst we are the first country to approve a vaccine 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamil_azam Clearly you’re delusional.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>29 days until we leave the transition period. 🇬🇧 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour led Wales for you. Ban on alcohol in pubs and social distancing to remain for the foreseeable. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Update: Due to exceptional incompetence, Captain Hindsight has flown up the ranks and is now promoted to General Indecision. Well done @Keir_Starmer.   While the @Conservatives lead the world on a #vaccination rollout, Labour lead the way on, erm, fence sitting? 👏🏼 #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>UK media don’t have headlines like the below in America...not the news they wanted? A Tory Government leading the world on a vaccine rollout &amp; an extensive vaccine portfolio. Starmer aka General Indecision, was clearly a bit taken aback regarding Pfizer too. #PMQs  https://t.co/FIAPEkqCpp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>UK🇬🇧 has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for widespread use. The media &amp; opposition parties will no doubt be very quiet on how well the @Conservatives Government has done on getting the UK ahead of the game on #vaccination.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope they get a lot of credit, doubt the media will mention it mind. Most easy to rollout will be the UK AstraZeneka one, as it doesn’t have to be kept at -70. Part funded by UK Tax Payers too. UK Government also has the biggest portfolio of potential #vaccines in the world #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whatever your views on #vaccination, the best route out of this nightmare &amp; getting the economy back, is the rollout of #vaccines. Pfizer rollout will hopefully be followed by AstraZeneka. The 🇬🇧 Government has done an excellent job getting us ahead of the game on vaccines #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too true. Brexit having major dividends already.... #PMQs #vaccine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boris once again made Keir Starmer and Labour look pointless. Keir (aka Captain Hindsight) has had a promotion, now goes by the name of General Indecision. On the fence still....abstaining from any serious decision he should be making. #PMQs  https://t.co/eFy0JTDsu4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Keir Starmer is useless at #PMQs. Just asking questions, which many of us already know the answer too. He thanks everyone for the vaccine, but a few weeks ago, was attacking the vaccine task force. He moans about the economic consequences, but wants a non stop lockdown. Pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks @pritipatel for fighting on this, it shouldn’t be this difficult to deport criminals. No thanks to dodgy lefty lawyers and Labour supporting the criminals over law abiding British citizens though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lockdown is over. Boris has introduced tiered restrictions &amp; people accuse him of killing the economy &amp; jobs. If Boris hadn’t done tough restrictions, people would say he was slow, putting the economy first &amp; killing people. Far more health/economy balance than Labour-led Wales.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColinDyckes It’s about American politics, we can disagree on some things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cjsnowdon For what? Trying to protect lives. You may not agree with it, but I guarantee that without restrictions, if deaths rose sharply in the weeks to Christmas, there would be people saying the Tories are responsible for more deaths. This is far more balanced than Labour led Wales!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColinDyckes It’s not about accepting it or not, if nothing changes, clearly it will be accepted. However, I don’t believe Biden would have won without fraud. Democrats have deliberately locked people out of viewing counting, gone against court orders etc. Clearly hiding something...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColinDyckes No no no. Florida for example had huge postal votes, yet they counted the majority before Election Day. All the states that kept counting for days after, were all the key states that had suspected fraud. A sudden stop in counting for hours during the night. I don’t believe it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColinDyckes I believe its clear fraud won it for Biden. A few states with razor sharp majorities for Biden, all with massive issues and reported fraud cases. The rest of America swung heavily to Trump from 2016, with him getting millions of votes more than last time.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EssexPR Least you can serve alcohol, unlike pubs in Wales. I know somebody who desperately wants to open but without being able to sell alcohol, and being forced to shut ut 6, it’s not viable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Terrible decision by Labour to ban the sale of alcohol in pubs, bars and restaurants, whilst also forcing them to close at 6pm. Labour have been failing Wales for decades. Only the @WelshConserv can defeat Labour in Wales next year. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds about right. Captain Hindsight doing a class A job as usual.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He wants them to fail, constantly undermines Gov, whilst abstaining on any decision making, in order to have more attack wriggle room. He wants things to collapse, that way he has attack lines &amp; ammunition. The worse the crisis, the more Labour can exploit for political gain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Keir Starmer is going to instruct Labour to abstain on new Coronavirus regs, then he really does show no leadership &amp; has no right to have a go at Boris. He just doesn’t want to take a position, so he can play both sides. Labour always attack, with no credible alternative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour Councillor promoting vandalism and destruction. Shock.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour want lockdown to last until Christmas and beyond. They just don’t want to be seen to vote against restrictions....so they sit on the fence, as usual. They can then play off both sides, as they did with Brexit successfully for so long, until people finally realised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy December folks!! Not a happy news day, but at least we have #Christmas coming soon. #1stDecember<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The High Street is being blown to shreds at the moment. New brands falling each day. Debenhams is a huge blow, on top of the likes of Miss Selfridge and Topshop yesterday. I really feel for what is happening to some massive brands and the impact it will have. I’m sentimental 😞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad news about this 142 year old brand. I loved doing a bit of Debenhams at Christmas! Devastating news for the economy and jobs in the UK.   https://t.co/z3MaDDvxbT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So in fact, @theSNP are giving nothing at all. All optical illusions and a way to try and score some political points. Sadly, many will fall for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonjayJJ @Ianblackford_MP @Jac_Curley_ @NicolaSturgeon @BorisJohnson Except the tax goes to Scotland and they can change it themselves. Do some research!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rockapepolitics @JamesfWells @WelshGovernment No, they will give a lot to Labour by taking away Conservative votes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UK_4_Democracy You don’t know what that means, unless you live in Wales under Labour. Now they are wrecking Wales.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet the UK isn’t part of who they are? This woman is dangerous and power hungry. Just sad that she has the ability to hoodwink people on a massive scale.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mancman10 You may not agree with everything the Tories have done, but they at least try to balance health with the economy. They have also put billions into things like the furlough scheme, business grants etc. Labour are just incompetent!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour are destroying Wales more each day. Covid has shown just how inept Labour are, as if some of us didn’t know already. Labour can never have a go at the Tories after the shambles they have created in #Wales. At least the UK Government tried to balance health with the economy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour have fu*ked Wales!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour always have, always will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour can’t make decisions can they. Awful party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can the @Conservatives increase opening times for pubs, bars and restaurants in England to 11pm, whilst continuing serving alcohol, yet Labour think it’s a good idea to ban alcohol sales in all venues, whilst forcing hospitality to close at 6pm. Labour have gone OTT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This👇🏼Labour are running Wales into the ground, they need a massive shock in May 2021.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Conservative run England (non Tier 3): Alcohol served all day and night in all pubs, bars and restaurants. Must close at 11pm.   Labour run Wales: NO alcohol allowed to be sold in pubs, bars and restaurants at ANY time. Must close at 6pm.  MASSIVE DIFFERENCE!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Aldeanuk @DaisyAdeleleo England it’s going down (under control), Wales it’s shooting back up. Guessing it’s based on that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just dawned on me that I won’t be dancing in a club this year to various banging Christmas songs, in the couple of weeks before 25th Dec. How grim. Literally no build up this year....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gambitman14 @nickeardleybbc Facts, look it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidgsumner @nickeardleybbc Well then, no businesses should go under then should they, or any jobs be lost. But, there are....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarenEMcMillan @DBeattie85 @p_bov1 @nickeardleybbc Many business won’t survive, and people will lose their jobs. Those people then have no job and income. It’s not the time to be giving out bonuses in my opinion, while others lose jobs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gambitman14 @nickeardleybbc Well Scotland has been given billions for businesses, yet it hasn’t all been passed on. Now we know one of the reasons why.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KameekMusic Exactly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kyle141220 Becuase I don’t want people to lose their jobs and think it’s better to go to businesses to help keep them afloat? Don’t even have to look at your account to know you don’t really have much intelligence and are anti Tory, anti Government, anti business, anti common sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ghost_wales Can’t even do it before 6pm in pubs etc. Alcohol is banned all day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickeardleybbc Surely this is better to go the businesses that are being hammered by more and more restrictions? I get they have done a great job through covid, but they still have jobs, many are losing theirs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too true 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A sensible policy that allows shops to open safely, businesses to try and recoup lost revenue and an increase in hours will help reduce bottleneck issues.   Shame hospitality isn’t quite so easy....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also better than Labour controlled Wales, where alcohol sales are banned in pubs, bars and restaurants. I just pray we are out of all this within a few months, as it is having such a detrimental impact on people’s lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour dictatorship for you. Remember they banned the sale of bedding, birthday cards, clothes etc in supermarkets during their ‘fire-break’. The same ‘firebreak’ lockdown that would allow pubs to trade in Dec. Mark Drakeford loves the power to control what Wales can do &amp; buy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This👇🏼  A complete blanket ban on alcohol sales and early closing times, in the weeks leading up to Christmas, is a complete disaster for many. Balmy policy by Welsh Labour and Mark Drakeford.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good to know we are prepared for this vital next step. I’m sure the media will do a good job at informing people we aren’t and how other countries are so much better prepared.... #NeverTrustTheMSM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rita Ora likes to lie it seems..... didn’t do anything for her bday she says in the post on the left. Then got caught, and had to then apologise for doing something on her bday, where she broke all the rules, whilst pretending she didn’t realise we were still in lockdown 🙄  https://t.co/PHX6Q0S0Gv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Makes you think👇🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why would 51% want to vote for @SadiqKhan I will never know. He’s been a compete and utter failure in every way for #London, breaking promises, missing targets and not dealing with what matters to people. He’s far more interested in virtue signalling and blaming others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour want to continue the lockdown in England until Christmas?! These people are nuts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate Mondays. Anybody a fan?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New picture for the 🎯 at Christmas!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR Imagine Labour’s Wales, complete ban on alcohol sales.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>💙💙<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One rule for celebs, another for the rest of us it seems. The contempt Rita Ora must have of us, if she thinks we are stupid enough to believe this crass statement. She thinks that she can just do what she wants, with no consequences. Hate the arrogance of some!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@warningshout To ban alcohol sales completely, even for take out, and a blanket ban across the whole of Wales, is shocking. I didn’t think Labour could get any worse, this means businesses are screwed in Wales.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No mulled wine at Christmas markets in Labour’s Wales then, or any alcohol in pubs and bars. Wales needs to kick Labour out next year, it’s one barmy policy after the other by Mark Drakeford and his cronies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour’s Mark Drakeford and SNP’s Nicola Sturgeon, just want power. Just look at the things they’re doing. Dictatorship leaders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You may think it’s bad having to order food (or a Scotch Egg) with alcohol in English pubs &amp; bars, but Labour in Wales have banned alcohol sales completely. Think about that, pubs &amp; bars in Wales not allowed to serve booze AT ALL before Christmas. Labour always take it too far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ITVWales @fmwales Completely barmy. A pub that can’t serve alcohol in the 4 weeks leading up to Christmas. And closing at 6pm for food and non alcoholic drinks, when the majority are in work before that. Labours Mark Drakeford in Wales really does go complete batshit crazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PurdyTp Im sure it was!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I understand restrictions are needed, but Labour’s latest policy in Wales is barmy. Mark Drakeford’s latest decision to force pubs &amp; restaurants to close at 6pm, whilst introducing a total ban on alcohol sales in hospitality will put thousands of jobs &amp; livelihoods on the line.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is Rita Ora thick, or just plain arrogant? She doesn’t give a toss. One rule for the rich and famous, another for us. She thought the lockdown was ending last weekend, when everything is still closed? What a load of absolute bulls*it.  https://t.co/QCCgcUbinz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pubs are no longer allowed to sell alcohol AT ALL from Friday in Wales. Well, what would be the point in opening then? A pub is a boozer. Nobody will go. If you close them at 6pm also, most people couldn’t go anyway, as most people work. This is bonkers stuff from Welsh Labour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. Labour Welsh Government stating that all hospitality venues will have to close at 6pm, for the WHOLE of Wales, when that is the only time most people can go (after work) and NO alcohol to be served in pubs at all. There’s literally no point going to the pub then! #Wales<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂 love this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Zero.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nmwdesign Where to begin with this. Much of the spread is from people who have it, but no symptoms. It you can identify them, you can limit the spread. Not hard to understand, and certainly no need for caps, especially when it is you that can’t understand basics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What’s this about Rita Ora breaking the rules and having a lavish party?Wouldn’t surprise me. It seems the rich and famous think the rules don’t apply to them, only us mere peasant folk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you look at the likes of many European countries, their hospitality is closed till later in December or even January. Nobody likes restrictions, but they are only as tough as they are now, because a minority of selfish people didn’t follow the rules to prevent them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many high profile twitter accounts have spent the last few months attacking Government over restrictions &amp; undermining them, when if they had spent that time encouraging compliance of the rules in homes instead, the restrictions wouldn’t be anywhere near as tough as they are now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matt_dathan @thejonnyreilly And?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SheilaStenhouse My logic is that protests don’t help anything, has it helped? No. Changes nothing. I didn’t say where I thought most of the infection spread was coming from, which in my opinion is mostly coming from indoor house mixing. Your tweet is flawed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 Maybe if a minority of some selfish individuals had stuck to the rules, it wouldn’t be like this now. Some spoil it for others, inc damaging businesses. The role of any Government is to protect lives. Very tough balancing act to protect the economy too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heard my first Christmas song of the year on the radio....it’s coming!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ghost_wales Think there’s more chance of abolishing it, if the Conservatives won it first. There is no chance of anybody other than Labour and Tories winning next yr. Any vote away form Tories helps Labour, and there’s less chance of change then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You may not like every decision the Government has made &amp; I’m the first to say, sometimes I’ve disagreed with the approach taken. However, there are no simple answers, they have a very thin rope to tread &amp; won’t please everybody. If you think Labour is the answer, you’ve lost it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acgrayling Do bore off. We’ve left. You lost. Pointless these polls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really can’t stand @NicolaSturgeon. She has the ability to hoodwink a lot of people, very slippery and completely untrustworthy. She doesn’t have the people in mind, she has power in mind. Sooner she’s voted out, the better. #marr<|endoftext|>

She can’t be trusted &amp; neither can the media, which let the likes of the SNP &amp; Labour in Wales, do what they want, without any scrutiny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robertsessford1 The media in this country only ever compare when we are worse, when things change and we are better, no comparison. The media in this country can’t be trusted.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Broonpot @MrDanCarroll Hahaha. Oh and the @theSNP know all about respecting democratic results don’t they....how many have they respected? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@usherwpa @PaulMer53 @CarolineCreator @Queen_Avatar_ @bantamsdad @patrotuc56 @James_Gregory3 @Gingerpatriot1 @A1istair @burypeewee @LoneFox0101 @OnAngelWings @MarineWren @Cheeseo76847269 Cheers mate! Back at you. 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Better when we all stick together!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrDanCarroll I know people that have voted for the SNP, and that wasn’t based on their stance in independence. They believe they had been decided. So again, I would disagree with you. Yes, many do want another vote. But it’s because they lost the first. That’s how I see it, we disagree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrDanCarroll Just because people vote for SNP MPs, doesn’t mean they did so to leave the UK. Force a country to stay? It voted to stay itself 6 yrs ago. Things will always change, you don’t keep repeating votes. I doubt if they voted to leave in 2014, there would be a push to do another vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can @SadiqKhan please start doing his job in #London. His failure in everything within his remit, says a lot. I fear that London is so hardcore Labour, it would vote for a bin bag of trash if it had a Labour rosette on. Londoners need to vote for @ShaunBaileyUK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrDanCarroll I’m against any new Scottish independence vote, as that was a once in a lifetime vote. We didn’t have votes to leave the EU when things changed with them, or Brussels got more powers. I believe in democracy, and votes should be respected, a vote less than 10 yrs later, isn’t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrDanCarroll London voted different. It’s not separated out, it’s votes across the UK. They were part of that process. That does not change the UK independence vote. To say they want to be in the EU, so they want to leave the UK, makes no sense. These types of votes are not the same as a GE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrDanCarroll Disagree. Brexit happened yes, but Scotland were involved in that vote as well. So that makes absolutely no difference. It took something like 40 years to have a vote on the EU, a lot happened in that time. You can’t just have votes every few years. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QWERTYorAZERTY Haha! Remain lost. They had no argument. Much like the yes Scotland campaign for independence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Slight correction: 6 not 4 years. All points still stand. It was meant to be a once in a lifetime vote, and that is how it should stay. You can’t just push for one again because you didn’t like how it went the first time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agw1437 We won’t know about spread outdoors, and I do believe the majority is indoors, however, I don’t think any protects will be helping anybody. Can’t just pick and choose which protests are allowed to break current covid restrictions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AntiWoke19 @jakepainter2 Yup. Just because I don’t support today protests, doesn’t mean I support BLM. I don’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scotland won’t be having another independence referendum while Boris is PM. Period. I know @theSNP &amp; @NicolaSturgeon are desperate for power &amp; it doesn’t matter to them that only 4 years ago Scotland voted to stay or that there are many other priorities, other than independence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer You take nothing seriously<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All she cares about is power. Vile woman.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jakepainter2 Problem is, even peaceful protests are breaking the current rules in place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR Oh I agree, it did start before lockdown, it started while we were in a regional tier system and when restrictions were brought in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimmyThePie @Chuckcat4 @BBCandrewkerr @JohnSwinney Last time I saw, Scotland voted to stay in the union. And that was a once in a lifetime vote. Good luck trying to get another vote with a UK Tory Government 😂 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimmyThePie @Chuckcat4 @BBCandrewkerr @JohnSwinney The Tories are pro the union, it’s as simple as that. One United Kingdom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grs68 @BBCandrewkerr @JohnSwinney What a load of rubbish. Scotland receives more money per head than England does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Protests in London won’t achieve anything positive, the only thing it could achieve is spreading covid more. This will lengthen the time London is in Tier 2. As I’ve said all along, if a select minority of selfish people had followed the rules, we wouldn’t be in this place now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ghost_wales I agree with the sentiment, but it’ll just help Labour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brisemac @Chuckcat4 @BBCandrewkerr @JohnSwinney It has more money per head than England<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chuckcat4 @BBCandrewkerr @JohnSwinney It certainly spends more than it contributes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is on top of threats to change road names like Churchill Way in #Wales. All I say is, do NOT vote for Labour next year. Wales must not let this Labour woke win. History and culture matter. I can’t wait for new laws to try and prevent this kind of nonsense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brexitparty_uk The Tories are investing billions into the North to level up, but covid has been unprecedented this year. They are trying to protect the health of the North. Stop playing games, you really have moved on from Brexit haven’t you, on to the next thing..lost a lot of respect for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whatever you think of vaccines, this is a step closer to getting back to normality. I welcome this news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely terrible by the Labour Mayor. History should be celebrated. Many of these historic figures did huge good and to cover, board up or take done statues is unacceptable. I’ve heard Labour in Wales plans to change street names like Churchill Way as well 🤬<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 That’s not true. To say that lockdown 1 didn’t work, because we had another is absolute rubbish. We had the whole summer with low cases because of how well the first lockdown worked. Why can’t people not go to the extremes on either side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlanHol45870796 Tiers have been strengthened, so that’s irrelevant on my point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a sh*t situation &amp; I feel desperately for businesses. However, this has always been in our hands, in everyone’s hands. If everyone follows the rules, tiers will change. Many state it’s mostly being driven in homes, true, but Government can’t control that, people do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MediaGuido This is bull. Channel 4 at 2nd? As if.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the Tiers look to be heavily based on this....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Errrr NO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just realised that #imacelebrity really isn’t the harsh living conditions we are used to watching.

<|startoftext|>This👇🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shows what happens when a Mayor doesn’t play politics and actually listens to the Government. ‘King’ Labour Mayor Burnham, wasn’t quite so good for Manchester after all, was he. Labour have continually tried to exploit covid for political gain, that has to stop now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour &amp; @theSNP are always out of sync with the public, same as when they didn’t want to listen to the democratic will of the people on Brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The_Dog_Sees The two are linked. Labour played politics, delayed Manchester going into tier 3. That’s meant covid hasn’t gone down enough there, and they remain in tier 3. Labour have caused Manchester more issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Manchester would be in Tier 2 with Liverpool, if Labour Mayor @AndyBurnhamGM hadn’t played politics. Government asked Manchester &amp; Liverpool to go into Tier 3 - Liverpool did as asked &amp; are now in Tier 2. Labour played games in Manchester &amp; lost critical time #tiersystem<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have a feeling that once the vaccines have been fully rolled out next spring, the economy is going to bounce back &amp; spring massively into action. The economy &amp; jobs growth is going to beat gloomy expectations/forecasts, as it did when we voted to leave. A few more months to go 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@montie @GillJames54 That was before a massive unprecedented global pandemic. We either prioritise UK or overseas, I know what I’d prioritise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree 💯   I think @BorisJohnson deserves credit for staying so firm. 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So predictable. It’s always the same people demanding more and more lockdowns, that are the ones who then attack the Government when there are job losses and the economy is severely impacted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only Labour want her back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC The UK is still the 2nd biggest contributor in the G7 for aid, AFTER the cut. However, the cut is vital to prioritise and protect the lives of British people 🇬🇧 over people overseas. I full support this decision. #SpendingReview<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GuidoFawkes Good riddance if she can’t accept that it’s far better to chop the foreign aid budget by £4billion and use that money instead to level up in the UK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She needs to bloody resign. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet Labour oppose it. Shock.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe if the presenter didn’t interrupt the Conservative/Non left wing guests, it would have higher viewing figures. It’s biased and left wing these days, nobody wants to watch such tripe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too right it will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chancellor @RishiSunak wiped the floor with @AnnelieseDodds. Made her look absolutely pathetic &amp; weak, which isn’t hard to do with Labour. Well done Rishi, I have full faith in you, Boris &amp; the @Conservatives to turn our economy around next year. 🇬🇧 #SpendingReview #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Desperate measures. Hope people don’t fall for this. Labour have not changed in the slightest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour are never clear on anything!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love this from Boris! 💙<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abbievdub @BorisJohnson What do you mean by legacy benefits? The @Conservatives have provided unprecedented financial support in the form of more tax payers money going into grants, loans, and more benefits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We all know that Labour can’t manage finances and the UK economy in normal times, let alone a pandemic that is hitting the economy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FANTASTIC NEWS.   Britain must come first. We must prioritise British workers and families in times of huge financial pressures and economic hardships. 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧   I am pleased that Rishi Sunak and @BorisJohnson recognise that.   #SpendingReview #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kevin_Maguire @AnnelieseDodds @RishiSunak Somebody is clearly delusional.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2020 has been hard, unprecedented in modern times. At a time of huge pressures on public finances &amp; our economy being damaged, there is no other party I’d want in place to help us recover than the @Conservatives. They can nurture the economy back to health. #SpendingReview #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m glad Rishi Sunak &amp; Boris have slashed the foreign aid budget. This year has been catastrophic on the public finances and money should be prioritised at home in the UK. 🇬🇧 #SpendingReview<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who thinks @SadiqKhan should be kicked out of office next year? #London deserves better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer So what would Labour do to sort the finances out? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HurricaneHeHe @Conservatives They announced more money for the NHS, taking it to £394m extra, BEFORE covid. As I said, do some research.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tayloramiles @AndyHammers Bit different, only some have the vaccine. Plus, flu is seasonal. Ridiculous comparison!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HurricaneHeHe @Conservatives Already started, do keep up. If you don’t know that more more is already going into the NHS per week, you clearly need to do some research.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dislike Biden on so many levels. Find him to be a slippery snake, tho he’s clearly clever enough to have hoodwinked some many.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Promise was made by the @Conservatives, and it was delivered. We have taken back control of our fishing waters. Now let’s get to the end of the transition period. So much more to come, but #Brexit is a long term thing, not an instant benefit. 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nicely said 🎉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afneil I do sometimes. Normally after work, but he can do what he wants.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shirl0716 I don’t believe any areas should be in Tier 3 in the run up to Christmas, hence why I wanted everyone to follow the rules to prevent it. However, London wasn’t in Tier 3 before lockdown and I certainly don’t think it should be after. It is the power engine of the economy as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you wake up on Thursday....  https://t.co/oGBVSnsbeK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaptnCrash Mate, it lifts the spirits 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have BBC actually confirmed Gavin and Stacey are doing more episodes? 🤞🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a great time it will be. 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#London should NOT go into Tier 3. Yes, selfish people breaking the rules have meant that things are worse than they should have been, BUT, London is critical for the UK economy. Keeping it closed in the 4 weeks before Christmas would be catastrophic for the UK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What an absolute joke. Some of the ideas and tactics used by Extinction Rebellion are just nuts, and make me sick. More than half the time it’s f all to do with climate change, it’s just an excuse to cause some carnage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hevmills Haha! I had a day off yesterday 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HHepplewhite 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It may only be Monday, but I’m on the booze already 🙈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope everyone will be jolly careful until Easter.... 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPJHodges It did. That’s bullshit. Cases were coming down before we went into lockdown. Cases would have been far higher without the tiers. To say it had no effect, shows a deep flawed understanding of the facts. It would have worked better, had everyone followed them though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour serve nobody but themselves. Labour should be resigned to the dustbin. The end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But the media and left don’t want you to know that....would make the Government look far too competent for their lefty bias.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahaha! Something I would do... 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BritainElects @YouGov Labour knocking out the park once more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thompson2_d Well, I’m happy it’s starting to open again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A slow, but necessary step to get us back to normality. Up to a maximum of 4,000 fans to be allowed into sporting events in England from next month.  https://t.co/XTQ5drdZug<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shamima Bergen should stay out of the UK permanently, she lost her right to live here when she left. Vile woman. I hope the Supreme Court make the right decision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good stuff, I agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@SadiqKhan has to go. He literally does nothing good for London. It’s not that he’s failed on a couple of things, he’s failed on everything. He breaks promises, lies and blames everything on others for his incompetence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HurricaneHeHe @Melissa3665 @GrahamAllen_1 It’s not 6 million. If 3 states flipped, trump would win. There’s less than 200k ballots between them all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HurricaneHeHe @Melissa3665 @GrahamAllen_1 I don’t believe Biden won fairly if I’m honest, but I think he’ll get away with it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Melissa3665 @GrahamAllen_1 Time is running out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thought #Ratchet was on for a second then, but it’s #ImaCeleb playing the same music!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Arsenal are shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s called virtue signalling and trying to get some good PR out of covid. Completely unfair to those who have lost their jobs, and others who have worked the whole year and had zero perks like this. Wholly unacceptable and smacks in the face of equality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour’s @SadiqKhan has failed EVERY resident in London, in every borough. He hasn’t delivered his promises, he’s bankrupted TfL, he’s failed to deliver crossrail on time, he hasn’t built the houses he promised, nor got crime under control. #London needs to vote @ShaunBaileyUK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaneGerson @AnnelieseDodds Exactly! Useless cow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears Ewww.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC @toryboypierce Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s a longer term strategy....gives us a lot more freedom long term to do big trade. Not an overnight thing tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>39 days until the end of the Brexit transition period..... 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it’s safe to say, people don’t have the most flattering words to describe Labour these days 😂👇🏼Quite a funny read of comments, nearly 2k of very accurate words I must say!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon You were the one calling for it. You change your mind one day to the next, which is whatever way you think public opinion is shifting too. Try leading and getting a grip on your remit in LONDON.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leebee999 @Mobile_Homme The green one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just can’t take anything Labour’s @AnnelieseDodds says, seriously. She just says what she thinks people want to hear, whilst also saying that everything the Government has done, was what she recommended they do. According to her, furlough was her idea. Delusional woman. #Marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vital that the backlog of the NHS is cleared, otherwise, it would have all been for nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Anybody who has voted fraudulently, should be prosecuted. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toniwriter Purple<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👀👀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly what I was thinking....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great that this lockdown ends on 2 December, however, if we are all in tougher tiered restrictions, then it’s basically still a lockdown. Don’t go crazy Boris, we need to feel some normality again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best news I’ve heard today!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty accurate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great job! Got me moving #Strictly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BritainElects @OpiniumResearch Labour knocking it out the park.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR We all know they can lose it at the end. West Ham being the perfect example. Playing well though atm🤞🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is the first word that comes to mind, when somebody says Labour?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpursOfficial Great start!! #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great start!!!! #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are footballers STILL taking the knee. Absolutely taking the piss now.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Looking forward to this game later. #COYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidLammy The only people who said ‘relaunch’ was the media. Bore off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What do Labour stand for? I really can’t see what the point of them is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Keep it up @trussliz.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Key thing to remember, don’t vote for @SadiqKhan and Labour next year. Simples.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree. Never seen so many pictures of her though!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get to see this one at the moment. Happy #Caturday  https://t.co/f81Yp2ze5U<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeborahMeaden I think the civil servants should be sacked there for not meeting their job requirements and disobeying orders from their manager .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Starmist_ On that currently!!! 👌🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who’s going to help me get to 5k followers?!? Less than 100 away!!! Drinks on me post lockdown 😂 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A socialist movement. No thanks. I’ll pass on that and stick with the Tories.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulBrandITV What happened to a verbal warning, then a written warning, before dismissal? Missed a few stages there Paul.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@MattHancock says he's formally asked the medicines regulator MHRA to assess the Pfizer vaccine. Things definitely moving fast now, with first doses being rolled out next month. Wouldn’t be surprised if other vaccines keep coming then. Finally an end in sight?🤞🏼#DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank go’s the @Conservatives are in charge is all I can say. We’d be in complete ruin with Labour in charge of the UK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BritainElects @RedfieldWilton All the more reason to get Brexit trade deal/or no deal done and dusted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a lovely sight 😍  One year later, Boris is still the PM.   The @Conservatives are still the party of the workers, upholding democracy and delivering Brexit. 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@Keir_Starmer saying he would have sacked Priti Patel, is pretty empty words considering Corbyn has now been readmitted to Labour, Angela Rayner is deputy leader &amp; goes around calling people ‘scum’ &amp; many of his other MPs are vile. I hate bullies, but it’s clear Patel is not one  https://t.co/gaqMh8lURz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afneil But they re-counted all the fraudulent ballots. Bit silly. Have to try and rely on court cases.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you’re keen for taking action against unacceptable behaviour, remind me again @Keir_Starmer, why is Angela Rayner still within Labour as deputy leader? Her behaviour, falls well below what is expected of an MP, such as when she called a Tory MP ‘scum’. All talk. No leadership.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer What did  you do about Angela Rayner calling an MP scum? Nothing. All talk and no action. Absolutely no leadership from you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonny86065726 However you spin it, and regardless of whether you think it’s true, it goes against the behaviour expected of an MP. She should have faced disciplinary action.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Keir Starmer saying he would have sacked Priti Patel because the report says she got ‘frustrated’ at times &amp; ‘shouted’. That’s not bullying. If he sacked people in Labour for bullying, there wouldn’t be many left. He didn’t sack Angela Rayner for calling an MP scum. All talk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour should stick to getting their own house in order before commenting on the Priti case. I like Priti, and she has nothing but praise form MPs and people she has worked with. The are a few however, who want her out. This is not bullying and the report says that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Says the man who campaigned to elect Corbyn as Prime Minister &amp; served under his shadow cabinet, while doing/saying nothing against antisemitism &amp; bullying within Labour. @Conservatives will take no lectures from Labour or Starmer. Priti Patel is not a bully &amp; is going nowhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>💯👇🏼  The left hate Priti Patel because she’s a strong Home Secretary. This will not push her out, she’s made of stronger stuff than that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@pritipatel is tough &amp; has high expectations of those in the HO. We need Priti Patel to be a strong Home Secretary who get things done &amp; can fight back. @10DowningStreet &amp; @BorisJohnson should continue the support. Notice the left didn’t care about Bercow bullying allegations...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA I don’t see how they can get away with not checking signatures. It’s allowed fraud and the wrong winner to be announced as president elect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boom!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just noticed that Emily Thornberry was on #bbcqt tonight. Good enough reason not to watch it, if I didn’t already have one. Anybody watch it? I’m sure she embarrassed herself again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who supports Priti Patel? I certainly do! I’m glad @BorisJohnson is standing firmly behind @pritipatel! The left want her out because she can be strong. The lefties want anyone out, that they deem are a threat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Typical Labour. Anti British until the end. They’d be the first to have a go if the @Conservatives left the country vulnerable, but don’t back a £16.5b boost in funding our defence  🇬🇧 🤷🏼‍♂️ 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Until it can be proved that she has done something seriously wrong, I am fully behind Priti Patel. One of my fave Conservative MPs. The media and left may rip into her, but it’s cos they fear her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Loving Rudy here👇🏼. He’s right to attack the biased media. Corruption on a huge scale.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a joke.  https://t.co/C5CjcKQb62<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichelBarnier @DavidGHFrost Pathetic. Use Microsoft teams or zoom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There’s literally no point anymore. You don’t have to suspend negotiations, you just do it remotely, like most of us are doing now for work. This is pointless. Just leave with no deal and be done with this nonsense. We leave the EU transition period in around 40 days.  🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boris Johnson says the UK will reclaim its mantle as the world's foremost naval power "if there is one policy that strengthens the union it is building more ships". Totally agree. I also agree with the extra spending on cyber. A truly Global Britain, post Brexit. 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Virtual meals?! Oh sod off Piers. Nobody cares what you think anymore. People are sick and tired of your constant negativity &amp; scaremongering. We are making constantly making sacrifices, but people do need to live as well. Christmas has to be as close to normal as possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely pathetic. Complete woke and getting beyond a joke now. #DefundTheBBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very pleased on this. Well done Boris!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This👇🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears I believe the full lockdown will end on 2nd Dec as Boris has said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fully support more money for defence, in this dangerous world. We should be proud of a solid UK defence. With cyber crime on the rise, it is vital that area is increased as well. Good to see @Conservatives under @BorisJohnson investing heavy in 🇬🇧 defence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For all the gin lovers out there, which do you prefer it with?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If this doesn’t make you think there’s fraud going on, nothing will. Dodgy stuff every day!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Jordan is my favourite so far!#imacelebrity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexiteerHead It was in the manifesto<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The UK is the priority, not the rest of the world. If our economy is smaller, that’s hits our country hard. To help combat that and recoup the billions spent this year, the aid budget should be cut. The end.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Seany1969 I don’t, he infiltrates my social media<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robbie_ws Labour locked down a second time too early if anything. It means cases can now rise fast, with 6 weeks to go before Xmas. I guarantee the situation will be a lot more grim in Wales than England at Xmas. Labour make a mess at everything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let Labour remain in opposition for eternity, where they belong.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Piers Morgan is happy with his son going to a mass protest &amp; doing all the things he wants to do, BUT, he’s against ordinary families meeting for Christmas, calling it dangerous. I think Pier Morgan is dangerous, his constant negativity &amp; anti Government propaganda is depressing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 To be fair, the Tory manifesto mentioned Reaching Net Zero by 2050, with investment in clean energy solutions and green infrastructure to reduce carbon emissions and pollution....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a mess. Fraud is so rife, it is clear Biden did not win. All the issues are in the key battleground states, where Biden narrowly ‘won’. Full AUDIT needed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vote for @ShaunBaileyUK &amp; @Conservatives next year Londoners. @SadiqKhan has failed London. #MayorElections #London<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disgusting how Labour are now attacking the Government for not running full tender procurement processes for PPE. Back in March &amp; April Labour didn’t care about rules, it was just about getting the PPE. It wasn’t about money, it was about saving lives. Now, it’s changed... #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Buying PPE fast was needed to save lives. Few months later, Labour use it to attack. Shameful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Astonishing that Keir Starmer now attacks the Conservative Government for moving heaven &amp; earth to get more PPE, even if it meant not doing competitive tendering at times. It was a national emergency, there was no time, as Labour kept saying at the time. Labour are pathetic #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely strong &amp; passionate performance by Boris at #PMQs. No doubt the biased media will spin it otherwise. He’s made Starmer look pathetic &amp; incompetent. Fully support the PM’s stance on devolution in Scotland &amp; Wales. Labour are just pointless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump He got 7 million more votes than 2016.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But we are so unprepared. Or is that what the media want people to believe....? I’m trusting @BorisJohnson and @Conservatives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennaEllisEsq Technical issue says it all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoePorterUK I’m coming to yours<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No no no. Labour can’t cling to power, they need to be voted out in Wales early next year. They are FAILING Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s clear the loony lefties run the show. It’s the hard left that is really in charge. @Keir_Starmer is just the face of a cesspit of racist trash. A Brexit blocking face that is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People make complaints about antisemitism in Labour: very very slow process, no outcome.   Jeremy Corbyn appeals a decision to suspend him for the racist, failed leader he was: fast tracked appeal. Readmitted to Labour.   Pretty obvious that @Keir_Starmer shows no leadership.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is anybody actually surprised Labour have reinstated Jeremy Corbyn? Asking for a friend.   Same old Labour, same old leadership.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GuidoFawkes 🤢🤢🤢🤢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bill_Cameron @fullabeanz Oh definitely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GuidoFawkes @val_leave 😂 couldn’t make it up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*Pretends to be shocked*  Suspending Jeremy Corbyn was just an attempt to distract attention &amp; be perceived as doing something. Be in no doubt, Labour have not changed. They are still the nasty, racist, incompetent, anti British, woke, covid exploiting, nut jobs they were before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In hindsight, chucking Corbyn out was a bit of a waste of time then. @Keir_Starmer (aka Captain Hindsight himself) was just pretending to do something, in order to overshadow the fact that Labour was revealed as a cesspit of racists. Labour are the true nasty party of the UK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Afterglow85 @ghost_wales That’s disgusting. Some pricks out there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve just about had enough of #Covid_19. I just want a normal life again, I won’t ever complain about the weather again, promise!  https://t.co/WCjrlZK8Ae<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afneil I don’t agree. We can see so many answered question, so many irregularities and they must be investigated. You are just like Biden, quickly move on, nothing to see, don’t look into multiple reports of fraud, elect Biden. The day you ignore fraud claims, the day democracy ends.  https://t.co/DITy7PmEDi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes yes yes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I personally think devolution is a complete disaster, emphasised massively during the covid crisis. The likes of @theSNP &amp; Labour in Wales, clearly have far too much power &amp; have exploited the virus for political gain &amp; to undermine Boris/UK Government. We are one UK 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have to prioritise the UK at the moment. Coronavirus has cost the UK substantially when it comes to finance. We have spent record sums and now in more debt than ever. Funding the UK must be the priority over the rest of the world. Period. 🇬🇧 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is great news. Covid-19 has cost the UK taxpayers hundreds of billions, inc financing the furlough scheme and business grants. Priority has to be given to the UK, rather than foreign aid. I fully support Boris in cutting the aid budget &amp; would personally like it cut in half.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see Sweden are doing massive lockdowns now, after cases have spiralled out of control. All those saying they got it right by not locking down, are looking a bit stupid right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @MDeeAnn If it had been at the normal rate, trump would have won Pennsylvania. Shows how rigged it is.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Agreed. Massive mistake. Reign the powers back in Boris.<|endoftext|>

Nigel is in campaigning mode now, facts don’t matter, only political attacks. Much like Labour. Only @BorisJohnson is getting on with the job &amp; will Get Brexit Done 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PDF53 @izcohar6 @GMB 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It doesn’t matter what Boris or the Government do, the likes of Piers Morgan, the media and all the crazy socialist lefties in this country, will always attack. Government is damned if they do and damned if they don’t. Sometimes I despair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Government has now secured 350m doses of various vaccines against covid (provided they are approved), inc Moderna. I’m sure the media will spin it negatively against the Government. Absolutely sick of the daily media bias attacks &amp; virtue signalling. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@louisewil86 @GMB Being Tory or whatever is nothing to do with it. Piers doesn’t listen to the answers, he doesn’t let Matt speak, he shouts constantly and doesn’t act in a professional manner. Most professionals do not act like that, but he isn’t a serious journalist or news presenter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyday is #OddSocksDay for me. Pairs only last a few weeks after Christmas, then they’re #oddsocks again. Best way!   Also agree with the sentiment here👇🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vivjones10 Many reasons, but I especially like the fact he’s a fighter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@louisewil86 @GMB Piers Morgan is not holding anybody to account. He’s just doing it for attention. At the end of the interview, we got nothing from it. Hancock doesn’t even get chance to speak or answer anything. Piers is rude, arrogant &amp; unprofessional. If that’s how I was in work, I’d be fired.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeborahMeaden @DominicGrieve1 You’ve lost it, he’s one of the worst that ever existed. You only like him because you wanted to overturn Brexit, like he did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anna_Soubry Have you looked at your own?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree 💯 ⁦@BorisJohnson⁩. Glad to have you on side.   https://t.co/4nC8dyeGFm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Piers Morgan proving again why there is no point Government putting ministers forward for @GMB. He isn’t interested in seeking information for the viewers, or listening. He just wants to attack them, try &amp; damage the Government &amp; put on a show. He’s a complete unprofessional joke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a Labour MP who clearly either doesn’t get the rules, or is trying to score some points, by exploiting the crisis again.   You ARE permitted to work. Boris also DID adhere to social distancing, but that doesn’t stop track &amp; trace if in a meeting more than a certain time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been a while since one of these videos.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Simple question.....simple answer. If you do believe it, you’re deluded. If you don’t, pray Trump and his lawyers can prove it all in court. Tough job proving millions of votes were fraudulent, but we have to try, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>💯 agree. Labour are truly awful in Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿. The people need to vote for something else next year, not more of the same Labour failure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🍿 🍿 🍺 I hope and pray that Trump can prove it all in court.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shame the wind didn’t blow @JonAshworth away. Utter useless MP, but that’s Labour MPs for you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Even Ant picked up on it👇🏼......who was it that said it? I don’t like arrogance. #imacelebrity #ImACeleb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did somebody just say ‘MBE’? Bit arrogant when just introducing yourself. #imacelebrity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a pretty good tourism advert for Wales. I’m sure @MarkDrakeford will take the credit. #imacelebrity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbclaurak It wasn’t a torrid soap opera week for anybody but the media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not again. 🤦🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would add in the economy/jobs/low taxes to that, but otherwise, I would agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillEtheridgeuk @Stuartshields75 Why would you vote for the Brexit Party, when we have left the EU, and Boris is staying firm against them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@karenwatson53 What’s Boris done to make him a traitor?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Stop lying to get some political advantage. You’re as bad as Labour quoting American stuff. Brexit is happening and you’re getting irritating now you’re campaigning for your new party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤞🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is not the Governments job to get people to lose weight. To say so, is ridiculous. This is not a nanny state.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like Trump more now, than I did before. Anybody agree?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>6 days after Wales leave their ‘fire break’ and cases are doubling in most areas. Wow! Imagine that at Christmas. The Labour Welsh Government and @MarkDrakeford have seriously messed up. There’s another 6 weeks until Christmas and everyone then mixes.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Couldn’t have put it better👇🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With @BorisJohnson and @DavidGHFrost in charge of Brexit, I have no doubt we will either get a deal that works for us, or we leave with no deal. Keep the faith people. Dominic Cummings made a massive impact, but it’s still in safe hands. 🇬🇧 #marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good. Boris is the man we need. 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is news, how?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>❤️❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m not, and most of the country I would say aren’t either. We do not want a socialist Labour Party running this country and so you will be in opposition forever with stuff like this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@giffordjackie An MP shouldn’t be a Spad to the PM in my opinion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jamin2g Same as before. Literally an obsession. They then don’t talk about things that matter, like our economy growing. The news for a week has been about Cummings or Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It wouldn’t make ANY sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is just criminal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@loservillekings My tweets and views are nothing to do with who employs me thank you. Personal account and all that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Xxx49798210 Brexit, is the exit. British exit, that was done in Jan. Now is the trade deal, and the end of the transition period, deal or no deal is 31 Dec. Quite simple really, so maybe you have missed something....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The media are a total disgrace. Two days of top headlines on @BBCNews regarding Dominic Cummings, yet the likes of the economy growing a record amount, barely mentioned. I also didn’t notice the media so interested regarding @MargaretFerrier travelling the country WITH covid 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dominic Cummings wouldn’t be going if the Brexit we voted for, wasn’t about to come true. @BorisJohnson won’t sell us out. We left, now we stop following EU rules. It’s all done and dusted basically. 48 days people. 48 days. 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was one knowledgeable listener. I do hope we show @SadiqKhan the door next year. He’s been utterly useless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lathamphil1 Making that up in your head aren’t you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Leave won. 🇬🇧  Brexit got done. 🇬🇧  Transition period nearly over. 🇬🇧  Thanks Dominic Cummings. 👍🏼  #DominicGoing, but will live on forever with the impact he made in No 10 Downing Street, helping deliver the will of the people &amp; beat a Marxist, Socialist Labour Party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@readmybook Gloating about what though? He wanted to leave by the end of the year. So you knew this would happen all year. I’ll gloat he delivered Brexit and we’ve left the nasty, corrupt EU behind. Remainers lost. Yay!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I personally liked Dominic Cummings. I believe without him, there would have been no general election, no huge majority, no remainer meltdown &amp; no Brexit. He will be missed in No 10. He was only around to sort out Brexit though, and in 48 days, we will no longer follow EU rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To all the remainers that still don’t accept Brexit &amp; are gloating that Dominic Cummings has now left No 10, this doesn’t mean Brexit is cancelled. You lost. We left. #DominicGoing now, shows the wheels are firmly in motion to leave the transition period in 48 days time. 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cut_the_crap_ec @SurfaceSkimmer @BorisJohnson Cummings himself said he was going to leave after Brexit. Don’t talk nonsense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Seany1969 A Labour Party that didn’t respect the referendum result, still don’t. Starmer was the shadow Brexit secretary. They haven’t changed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most wouldn’t have their seats without him either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kirstiealley Could the electoral college members vote ur down if they believe there was fraud?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nick_Pye 🥱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh 💯 true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour should never be trusted to put Britain’s 🇬🇧 interests first. They couldn’t be trusted to respect our Vote Leave. They can’t be trusted with the economy, spending money effectively, law &amp; order, jobs, or anything really. Look at the mess in Labour led Wales.  #FridayFeeling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Completely delusional👇🏼#BrexitReality 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterAlexander @maggieNYT I don’t think anybody can argue that he’s popular. Trump got 73m votes. More than any other sitting president. Also, more votes than any winner before 2020.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lewis_goodall How are these clear wins? There are hundreds of thousands of ballots being reported as fraud, blocked viewing of counting, dead people voting, machines switching votes, ppl voting in states they don’t live in. These are not clear wins at all with massive fraudulent claims.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Media are frothing at the mouth about Cummings leaving. He was never going to be around long term, as he was the Brexit man. It’s not top headline news worthy either @BBCNews &amp; all the other media cronies now on cloud 9. Like the media in America over Trump, you’re pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidLammy British public deserve less of your tweets and bitterness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexwickham Not really what he said though....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gotta love him and how he calls out the fake news. Man got some balls.  https://t.co/nDaTuBSzw6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree. That’s the biased, fake news media for you. Both in the UK and USA, brainwashing in operation. People must resist. Turn off the media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnelieseDodds Go away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Completely agree. Most teachers have had the majority of the year off, on full pay. What the discount for? Then there’s others, who have worked all year, often doing things covid related, no discount. A massive sham.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HHepplewhite Depends if they hand count the fraudulent ballots....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PlasFron @robinbull1 @Dianna46669303 @BBCNews Your point? It’s still a massive rebound. We are still going through the pandemic, I never expected us to be above pre pandemic levels<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HKrassenstein Trump has well over 71 million votes. You can’t compare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>UK economy grew by 15.5% in July to September, which was the biggest on record. No more recession, as predicted many months ago. ⁦@BBCNews⁩ don’t even have this as their top story. I hate the MSM and their blatant bias.   https://t.co/Yj5NljjlGu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vivjones10 I want him to stay indefinitely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How are America still counting in the likes of Georgia, Arizona &amp; Pennsylvania?! The UK count millions of votes in one night, yet a week after the 🇺🇸 election, and they’re still counting. Absolutely pathetic &amp; open to massive fraud. Funny how they are all the knife edge states.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank fu*k!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dragon_wingz @charliekirk11 Problem is, you won’t know which ones are the illegal ones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Except a few million were fraudulent!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can the courts, not deem Michigan null and void? Biden clearly did not win. Fraud is on a massive scale. 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amazing_haz @Wizard_Predicts Exactly. Ridiculous. Pure fraud. UK count millions upon millions in one night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Conservatlve_JA Just something I’ve noticed. What that means I don’t know....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Conservatlve_JA As if. Only young Tories saying this really...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GJHeducation I can talk about what I like thanks. Education in Wales for example, regarding cancelling the exams next year is ridiculous. I can comment on that if I choose, as I can about anything. Bye.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour keep messing up financially and then beg the UK Government for bailouts. Why should UK tax payers fund Croydon Council. That’s the problem with voting for Labour, they destroy finances. If Government just bails everyone out, no incentive for Labour to manage effectively.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love this picture 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GJHeducation The fact you’re drooling over the fact I made a typo says it all. Twitter is very different to work. But there is no point in debating anything with you, you’re just plain rude and delusional<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GJHeducation 🤣🤣 I work for a council myself and I know how they work. If they have run out of money, it’s cos is poor management. Likely UK Gov stepping in. Again. On the Welsh thing, pretty pathetic because you have diff views. The let down is Labour, who have let down the communities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This could eliminate the machines being dodgy, but won’t sort the fraudulent ballots issue. This needs to be done in all battleground states, as well as a full audit of the ballots. Fraudulent ballots &amp; illegal ballots need to be removed FIRST.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where’s all the millions of extra cash the UK Government have given them? Awfully run.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can’t help but find the media an absolute disgrace. They bang on about unsubstantiated claims, but the biggest ones come from them. I know it’s fake news most the time, but can’t do anything. About time the media were scrutinised &amp; taken off air for bias &amp; inaccurate stories.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great stuff Boris! 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never forget our heroes. They deserve our gratitude for their bravery and sacrifice. #ArmisticeDay  https://t.co/DPmJX1Wq0W<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is  absolutely disgusting. These are sick bas*ards pretending to care about anything else other than attention seeking and virtue signalling. So disrespectful and does NOTHING but anger people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After the polls before the 🇺🇸 election, nobody will take this serious. They said Biden would win Wisconsin by 17% 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HHepplewhite @RudyGiuliani Any news?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My mum in the picture @LindaBEdger 🥳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly, the media in this country are a disgrace in every way. Nobody will ever bother to come forward to concerns if everyone passes it off as false.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why would anybody concede when there are many incidents of fraud reported? It has to be looked into, whether it can be proved in court or not. People have signed statements saying how it exists, so wrong not to look. #TrumpConcede? NO!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be hilarious. No food delivered, no oil, no petrol, nothing. No illegal votes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Barely made any difference. And now everyone will go bonkers. It’ll be through the roof within a week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely disgusting. Lock them up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 has the highest rate of infection of Covid-19 in the UK 🇬🇧, AFTER their lockdown, what the hell is it going to be in a few weeks?! Streets are packed. Labour Welsh Government has lost control. There are major outbreaks in hospitals, I know, my aunty caught it in one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wish John Major would shut up. Nobody cares about his opinion any more. Too desperate for airtime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Any votes counted without republicans present, are illegal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m sorry, but it simply isn’t acceptable. With over 100m mail in ballots, illegal votes are clearly on a scale never seen before. That will have flipped a few states. Biden only won by flipping a few states, by the slimmest of margins. Whether it can be proved, I don’t know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*waits for twitter to sensor the tweet*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This👇🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColinWard3 🥱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂 looks like legal action made her do this. Courts are a wonderful thing when they aren’t corrupt and full of lefties.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watch it go through the roof now as well!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DCBMEP Hope so!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimRunsHisMouth @AndyHammers Of course they did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love how Van Tam describes things. Choo Choo. 🚂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shhhh! A vaccine by Xmas from Pfizer, mass testing up to 500k a day by the UK Government. Not a good day for the media, too positive. They don’t want ppl to know we’re testing more than any other country in Europe, or mass testing is rolling out #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many people have a go at Boris &amp; the Government, but at the end of the day, they are doing everything they can to get us back to normal life, whether we agree with every decision or not. This is national effort now. I have faith. #DowningStreetBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boris: “Let’s get the virus back in it’s box.” #DowningStreetBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why the hell are we watching Biden instead of Boris on @BBCNews. He’s not even the 🇺🇸 president right now. This is ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vicanall @piersmorgan @realDonaldTrump You don’t need to write a column to say that. This is pure clickbait.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You’ve been warned Wales. Lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s nothing to do with Biden, it’s do do w that the vaccine announcement today. Fake news media yet again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good. The House of Lords isn’t fit for purpose anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricMMatheny Not enough to win<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robbie_ws Does it not bother you that the election could be based on a lot of fraudulent activity?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Trump was right about the vaccine coming soon. Suspect, that the announcement from Pfizer comes a week after the US election. Biden will now take all credit for bringing in a vaccine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottBentonMP And the referendum on whether to leave or remain. The sheer arrogance of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ianblackford_MP @JoeBiden Find this hilarious considering you never accepted the referendum in 2016.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂🤣 This from @Ianblackford_MP and @theSNP. When did they ever accept they lost the 2016 referendum? They showed no grace when they lost a fair election. They sadly spent 4 years trying to block Brexit and still ain’t over it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😅😂😂🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnaCabrera Liar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanmaguire1973 @RebelleTx @kayleighmcenany So why did they have to get a court order for acccess?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Patrick51087359 @kayleighmcenany How can they prove dodgy stuff if the law was broken and they weren’t allowed access in some counties to watch the count?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UTakeDrugsDanny @Jimcorrsays He didn’t. Bush took legal action.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RebelleTx @kayleighmcenany How if they can’t get access to the count?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhilHegedusich @kayleighmcenany Is it? In every county?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mallon69 @1extremelady2 @kayleighmcenany A lie then 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mallon69 @1extremelady2 @kayleighmcenany I don’t doubt. Bit odd considering they’ve spent the last month saying it’s too dangerous cos of the pandemic. Was that all a lie?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@of_arbys @kayleighmcenany I don’t believe all are, just some.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anewanonguy @kayleighmcenany That’s you mate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@of_arbys @kayleighmcenany And there’s the democrat 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@of_arbys @kayleighmcenany Prove it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@of_arbys @kayleighmcenany Not in all locations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany If the democrats can’t prove there was no fraudulent activity or irregularities, then the votes counted should be deemed illegal. The fact there was no republican watchers means they can’t prove it was fair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vivjones10 Yes agree, some plonkers around, but the Government hasn’t under reacted, that’s just people. I find this ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How the hell can the Government be under-reacting? We are in a full lockdown, testing up to 500k a day and furlough open until next March. Like wtf!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@moonlight_riley @ScottPresler @realDonaldTrump Like the democrats did when Trump won in 2016?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenKahlig @nytimes Not even close? The likes of Pennsylvania is less than 1% in it, as are other states, and that’s with millions of paper mail in ballots open to fraud. Just 4 states flipping to Trump that are less than 1% between them, would change the election. Hard to prove in court I admit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytimes Yet he didn’t give up against Gore. He should know better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More scanned for Biden no doubt. Biden has only been projected the winner by a handful of states that were tight. If they, after further investigation/audit/recount/court proceedings, flip to Trump, things can quickly change. I believe Trump won, need to prove it now in court.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hadym @GaSecofState Other states have issues. If just 4 have issues like this, Biden loses. Every state having issues right now or irregularities, need to be audited.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ASTRONxte @EricTrump If you think there’s a blue wave, your deluded. About a handful of states are razor tight, and with so many irregularities, none of those results can really be deemed accurate. Whether that can be proven in court (as republicans were banned from viewing counts) is another matter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulieMetcalfe16 @Tucker31611548 @RobbieJJensen @EricTrump Nothing is official actually until it’s certified in December. Brush up on your facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage We only left in January, so we haven’t had 4 year to do a trade deal. Liar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalebJHull @Texas_Yankee4 Now they don’t care about covid 🤔🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarolineLucas So you still don’t believe in democracy? Leave won, you didn’t accept it. Boris won. He’s out PM. You don’t accept that either. You’re a disgrace for an MP, a true embarrassment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alanbellamy11 @EricTrump Proof goes through the courts. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColinDyckes Democrats blocked republicans watching the count in many areas, the likes of Pennsylvania overruled state rules, allowing  ballots to come in for days after the election, IT glitches, ppl voting that arnt entitled etc. Why are you ignoring those? Those have to be checked<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EamonJavers @PeterAlexander @CNBC Clearly the democrats do not abide by the law, you’re ignoring clear irregularities and suspicious activities in these counts. It’s clear to anybody fraud has gone on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricTrump The democrats wouldn’t reject them because they know they need them to overturn Trumps clear lead. This fraud is on a massive scale<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Evidence will take time to gather, but a key problem is that the democrats have been blocking republicans from watching the count in key counties and states. That means that they have no idea what has gone on in order to gather that evidence. A full audit needs to be done urgent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This HAS to happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All the key battleground states in 🇺🇸 that counted majority of mail in ballots BEFORE Election Day, such as Florida, have Trump winning. All those that started counting on Election Day and were still accepting ballots until yesterday, have Biden narrowly ahead. It’s clear fraud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Add to this, this is used across many other states too. Means the numbers could be way way out. Chances the glitch only happened in one country in Michigan is very low. This is now a mix of so many errors, and with key states on a knife edge, need to get this corrected urgently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevinAl1976 How many ballots are left to be counted? Have the military votes been counted?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Berumster @realDonaldTrump How’s you’re right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OHPredictive How many votes are left?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VitaVitaVita48 @CHueyBurns It’s gone 9pm EST now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShannonBream What happens if they haven’t done it and now all the ballots are mixed in? How could they possibly segregate them now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perfectly said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IngrahamAngle How come the UK can count millions on one night, but yet places like Arizona takes nearly a week?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1776Stonewall Stop the fraud!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Idonttwit @JohnOnealt @BradStoney1776 No military ballots have been counted in Georgia yet tho<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>One thing after the other....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sir_frankuk And it’s now going to do a recount. Also thousands of missing military ballots, which woudl favour trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dreamca22749288 There are many videos, and I’ve seen some shocking stuff. A lot of evidence will have to be provided to courts, due to sensitive info and personal information.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The list could go on. Democrats are cheating and evidence should be brought to courts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ppl saying Trump should concede. Would you concede based on some states that are knife edge &amp; when there are reported fraud incidents? I wouldn’t. Georgia is less than 2k with ballots missing. Pennsylvania are counting late ballots, Nevada has ballots of ppl that don’t live there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jamin2g It’ll finish around 60k ahead. Problem is more than that will be fraudulent or late ballots received.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@molly_knight @realDonaldTrump This kind of comment says how corrupt things are. There are still states undeclared, many incidences of voter fraud and evidence emerging, so no person should concede defeat with so much uncertainty around the results being accurate. Thai very comment proves what he’s up against<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SaltyDuchess It’s because they’re still accepting ballots<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boakyewaaglover @DC_Draino There should be an audit trail of tabulations. Any after the court order should be taken out, as well as any that arrived after the election. If that’s done, Trump would win. They’re hiding something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RAF_tweets There’s thousands upon thousands. People aren’t going to go to court for 1 vote. And how is a court case going to review hundreds of thousands. It’s impossible. Fraud on a national scale will change the presidency<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What this election reminds me of, is when you see a film &amp; somebody needs help. They run to the police, but their bent, they run to somebody else, they’re in on it. Where are people meant to go if their vote was stolen or cancelled? Ballots have been counted that were late. Fraud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HHepplewhite Hope you’re right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbcnickrobinson @FoxNews Then you have CNN completely fake news, blocking the truth and completely one sided<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VaMaFraVi @mindimcalli @DC_Draino Nothing stopping them damaging trump ballots, then redoing them as Biden ones. They won’t let republicans watch, so clearly dodgy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hnterziggy Down more like<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s clear that Joe Biden did very well with seniors, particularly those aged in the 125-200 range! #ElectionResults2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Roswell_nigga @GabeGuidarini Have the military ballots been counted yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@0_politics2 But yet if ballots received after Election Day are excuded, Trump wins. Needs to go to US Supreme Court.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytimes The fraudulent process<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DocRockulus @JamesOKeefeIII @USPS @realDonaldTrump There are hundreds of cases like this, that’s the issue. That on a. Huge scale means it makes a huge difference to the result<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those last few percent of votes seem to be a lot harder to count than the first 80 or 90%. Not enough legit ballots, so making more. It’s not realistic that turnout is pretty much 100%, votes are turning up randomly and in some states, they won’t let republicans watch the count.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanieocarroll @bailscd @bbclaurak There was a woman on the TV earlier stating she was denied her vote in person, as she’d already voted according to the system. Stealing votes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbclaurak Legal ballots yea. Not ones from the dead, the wrong people or late ones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytimes Gives them extra time to get more votes from the dead, and find some extra hidden ones under the floorboards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@millie701011 Disgusting isn’t it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who would expect this in a democracy like America. Absolutely awful. Biden will claim full victory tomorrow, along with the media calling it, BUT it’s based on a few knife edge states going his way AFTER massive fraudulent postal ballots. With the fraud, Trump would win. Fight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only just realised it’s #BonfireNight2020. This lockdown/covid mess of a year is messing me up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This👇🏼  With up to 10% of ballots sent to the wrongs address, individuals coming out saying that they’d had their vote stolen, thousands having voted who don’t live in Nevada anymore, it’s serious fraud. Likely that Biden will be declared the winner for president, based on Nevada<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cleared corrupt. This proves it. Trump win Pennsylvania, and Biden is doing everything he can to fraudulently claim the state.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamVTV Clearly something to hide then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that Biden’s Democrats are doing this, to stop Republicans from watching the ballot count, shows they have something to hide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been zoned out of British politics lately, have I missed anything?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the counting should be stopped until the republicans can watch the counting. Democrats are corrupt. Too much fraud going on in the critical states left. I hear dead people’s votes being counted, Trump ballots being destroyed, no checking on signature verification, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Problem is, the democrats are counting dead people’s votes, votes that have come in late and Republicans have been refused to watch the count.....suspicious! Trump votes have also gone missing, been invalidated etc. Fraud is on a big scale it make Biden win in key states.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is something very strange going on in a select few states. Funnily enough, the critical states where Trump was winning and the whole presidency relies on..... 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ghackney78 @5thCap @VinceNe59902610 @CambridgEcon101 @urifinzi @SunshineSt8Sam @realDonaldTrump Should have got their votes back before polls closed really.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andybiggs4az A whole 24hrs? They’re counting at a snails pace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@urifinzi @SunshineSt8Sam @realDonaldTrump These were made in Election Day. I’m Pennsylvania, their still accepting new ballots for days<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jay_Beecher What’s the ratio? I hear he needs around 56%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nate_Cohn where is Nevada heading in your opinion?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@D0gFacedPony @Suziwonga75 Corrupt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The votes left to count in Nevada ....are they in person or post-in ballot? That will basically tell us the result.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AJ_1066 I don’t know what to believe anymore, but I don’t believe some states have counted properly. I think Trump has increased his bite massively overall (2m or so) inc in Florida, but I think dodgy stuff in Arizona has gone on, including discounting votes in a district<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoonMiniie I don’t get how they haven’t called Georgia, yet have called Arizona<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomhfh All comes down to Arizona and yet there’s been a lot of shenanigans going on there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tnewtondunn What if Arizona call was wrong? typical fake news<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wtf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tnewtondunn That’s if he get Arizona. It hasn’t been called by some.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is all getting ridiculous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@d_memoriae I think it’s suspect machines went down in election day in Pennsylvania, think it’s odd they don’t start counting before Election Day and note that many ballots have miraculously disappeared and then been found<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@d_memoriae Yes I know its operated by different rules, stupid ones. All states should be consistent. That would avoid millions being counted after Election Day and open to fraud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why the likes of Pennsylvania is corrupt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR Which way?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump At the end of the day, Pennsylvania should have started counting post ballots weeks ago, like Florida, to avoid this. It’s not normal in any democracy to be counting millions days later.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPJHodges Hardly. He’s up in the vote from 2016. Yes he’s losing a few states he won, but also dodgy stuff going on in some. Regardless, he’s massively up in the vote in many areas, so hardly rejected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It ain’t going to happen. The EU are inflexible and a disgrace. We will have to walk away at some point, this is pointless. 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>VERY STRANGE indeed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RockboltG I’m hearing a lot of bad stuff going on there. Apparently lots of ballots rejected from in person voting due to the ink used on the ballots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t think Trump is a happy man, and I don’t blame him. He’s up massively in most states, but a few, there definitely seems to be some odd things happening, such as machines going down, hand voting in person votes &amp; postal votes magically appearing. What do we think?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I smell fraud and dodgy going’s on with these postal ballots. Nonetheless, Trump is still doing massively well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By my current calculation, Trump is going to lose the whole election, all because of one state that he wouldn’t afford to lose from 2016....Arizona! He’s on track at the moment for 268 votes I think, he needed 270 to win. Ouch. #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@josh_soane Not sure that’s a good reason to stay awake 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do I go to bed? Will I miss anything? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears Makes it a lot harder if he loses Arizona. Would need to take Pen, Michigan, Wisconsin then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@0_politics2 @Rabberoonies He’s like 200k votes behind though....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@0_politics2 @Rabberoonies What do you think about Arizona now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIZMAGA What does he need to be up by to cushion him for the massive mail in vote? Anybody know?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@princebtc28 @CHIZMAGA They have to make up over 200k votes. That’s hard....depends what votes are left. Are all the mail in ballot votes already in?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIZMAGA Yet. Arizona is not looking great....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Arizona not looking good for Trump #ElectionNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIZMAGA Could be key<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surely it’s time to call Florida for TRUMP??!!! Let the sun shine on a great day ☀️ #ElectionNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIZMAGA No mail ballots counted though....heavily skewing it so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whatever happens, polling companies in America are absolute awful. #ElectionNight #Elections2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIZMAGA Does anybody think this could flip to Biden?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anybody worried about Pennsylvania? #ElectionNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@0_politics2 Ohio is worrying. I also though Pennsylvania was counting mail ballots last<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyhewertson Changed a few times, abc at the moment. BBC was too slow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Florida is giving me whiplash.... #ElectionNight #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coalspeaker Who does this benefit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the one I’m most nervous about #ElectionNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nasty cow (Trumps niece) on BBC right now. How is Biden healthy compared to Trump? He’s a walking corpse. #ElectionNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@0_politics2 Not good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m getting very nervous now. Anybody else?  #ElectionNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting some reports Trump is up in Florida, other reports state he is down in 2016. Which is accurate? #ElectionNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Biden wins Florida, I’m off to bed.  #ElectionNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobWilson_RDG As long as Biden is only doing better in the likes of California<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Coming from @SadiqKhan 🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RendleGary Was just saying the same thing. It’s all pro Biden anti Trump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@the1murdock @EricTrump @RoxySpencer11 Whaaaaat?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottPresler Thing is, this doesn’t include which why independents have gone. Critical people go out and vote. This isn’t enough!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIZMAGA What’s the mail in ballots advantage to the dems?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulfish2skyco2 How much you bet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wivenswold Think you’ll find there’s a lot of us...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SadiqKhan @JoeBiden Don’t speak on behalf of others. We are not all rooting for Biden thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The guy is a sad, attention seeking, waste of space.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@honeybadgeronyt It’s not gone particularly well. Cases are still going up in many areas, and considering the ‘firebreak’ ends next week, I can see Labour doing another one or two in Wales within the next few months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad that we live in a world where there are so many terrorists. Need to be very alert going forwards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, final predictions... 🇺🇸 🇺🇸   Who will win #Election2020 ?  #PresidentialElection2020 #ElectionNight #ElectionDay #RETWEET<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIZMAGA Can we be sure of this though?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour making a balls up of everything they do in Wales. Completely unacceptable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For all those stating that Nigel Farage is the UK’s Trump, that is a load of absolute garbage, many differences. Trump had the majority of his country behind him &amp; he won the US election in 2016. Farage couldn’t even win a constituency to become an MP, despite several attempts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@0_politics2 Me with bells on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnelieseDodds Rishi has done an excellent job. He’s reacted quickly to changing needs and situations. It’s not a one fits all, for a long period of time. We’d be bankrupt with that approach. He changes support as it is needed. Just go away if you have nothing useful to say. Typical Labour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour Dodds is useless. The chancellor is reacting quickly to a an ever moving pandemic &amp; changing situation. It is right that as things move, his help &amp; support adapts &amp; reacts. @RishiSunak has done a brilliant job, it’s about time Labour stopped this nonsense.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 @Wicksylax @Keir_Starmer Starmer just wants to exploit everybody’s woes for political gain. He’s a sad excuse for a man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sootmeister Haha! I’m just in boxers working from home most days 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Definitely fresh out today! Winter hat needed 🥶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GregoryZachBell @realDonaldTrump How is that known?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreatAlexandor We can all have differences, it’s normal. But with lockdown, for me, it could have been avoided. It’s damaging in so many ways for people. Also, if the same people having parties now, don’t change their behaviour, it might not even work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GazWatty1 @sandieshoes I support Trump for other reasons other than covid, mainly because he stands up for America, better on the economy etc, whereas Biden is completely useless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The supermarkets. Are. Not. Closing. Ffs. What is wrong with people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Get stuffed. Only people to blame are the people who didn’t follow the rules &amp; had indoor parties etc. Sunak has been an excellent chancellor. Labour would have been a disaster. So easy to moan and attack from opposition, anything thing trying to get a country through a pandemic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Several reasons probably. I would have thought it’s to allow businesses as much time as possible to prepare and make arrangements. Businesses might need to sell off stock, update staff etc. I would also say it’s to allow people to prepare, as well as the vote in Parliament.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB @piersmorgan @susannareid100 Load of rubbish. Pure trash journalism &amp; scare tactic propaganda. Many will die of non covid related things, hence the need to keep the economy open with targeted local restorations. That was the right approach &amp; if everyone had followed the rules, we wouldn’t need a lockdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some may not agree with everything the @Conservatives are doing right now, some things are definitely not the usual party way, but neither is a global pandemic. Once this is all over, the party will be able to go back to it’s normal ways. Brexit will be done as well...have faith.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mariacaulfield @SussexUni @BorisJohnson Well said. Been saying this for weeks. I believe a lot of it will be down to indoor parties, that otherwise might have been outdoor gatherings in the summer. House-parties with large groups, in enclosed spaces with no social distancing is ripe for spreading covid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do some want schools closed? It’s not health related. Children have been out of school for most of the year, which is worrying for young children. School is essential for learning, development, mental health &amp; social interaction. It’s critical. Do not #PutSchoolsInTheLockdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyBurnhamGM @JoeBiden Not a clue. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Morganlefay110 @funder What state ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FelaProducer But Biden isn’t in favour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dante_Elephante Where?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realTrumpForce A car crash.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR Do you think the lockdown will bring down cases/hospital admissions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vivjones10 @realDonaldTrump You going to stay up watching results come in?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think non voters in 2016 will win it for Trump. They are often not weighted correctly in polls because of the fact they don’t normally vote. I think this election they’ll be out in their droves. Incoming red wave for @realDonaldTrump? 🌊 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR Doesn’t matter how strict you are, ppl can still have house parties. Students can still have large gatherings in halls of residence. I don’t believe in lockdowns are the answer, hence I wanted to avoid one. Everyone doing their bit is the right thing to do in my opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterBarker23 @christopherhope @SWYforEurope The majority then 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I support Brexit. I support Boris. I back the Government in trying to balance so many issues. I don’t support another lockdown, but I blame selfish rule breakers for it. I support Trump. I hate opportunists who try to exploit the pandemic, like Nigel Farage &amp; Labour Keir Starmer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulfish2skyco2 Boris never said this tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lewis_goodall @TraceyRees2 He’s setting up a new party because the Tories are delivering Brexit and he needs to stay relevant. His party will be the anti lockdown party, yet again, it is only time limited and will pretty much be over before any more elections. Then what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jamie_Sense @Nigel_Farage You do realise the Conservatives never boxed in Churchill, that was the Labour mayor. The Conservatives are working on new laws to prevent payouts and councils taking statues down. It’s not as simple as because he’s the PM, he can do what he likes. There are processes and rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCSendon70 @Conservatives Change them how? Turn them in an anti lockdown party you mean? The Conservatives don’t want to lock down, they gave everyone the chance to avoid any further lockdowns. Some took the piss. At the end of the day, it’s very different having to run the country through a pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCSendon70 People can have differing opinions, but you don’t set up a new party for each of those issues. It’s nothing but an attempt to rebrand from Brexit to get some attention, and what better way than to exploit the Brexit crisis for political gain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cliff_grieve @christopherhope We technically left, but yes, we still abide by rules until 31 Dec. For a virus that won’t be around effecting our lives in a year, creating a new party seems a bit extreme. It’s all for the attention he craves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@freethinker967 @Ara_MaHubbard @christopherhope All Nigel offers is the a few lines on the latest news topic. Before Brexit trade talks have even finished, Farage is into his next things. It’s pathetic. That’s not leadership.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cliff_grieve @christopherhope I don’t know if you haven’t noticed, but we left the EU in January and are currently negotiating a trade deal. Before that is even finalised, Farage is onto the next. Regarding covid, it’s an ever changing situation, one that isn’t predictable or static. Very fickle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LordMoleUK You could have just cancelled your membership, didn’t need to write a letter. Definitely better off with Nigel, he likes attention seeking too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ronlynn53 You don’t start a new party up for ever different issue. We are still dealing with Brexit and signing trade deals around the world. Nigel just doesn’t like it when the attention isn’t on him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage @PrisonPlanet Pathetic. The new Labour Party, exploiting the crisis for political gain. Missed the limelight did you? Boris is still delivering Brexit, so now you move onto something else. Lost any respect I had for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ara_MaHubbard @christopherhope But then we’ll end up with Labour councillors. No thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YorksBrexit @christopherhope Covid won’t even be around in the next general election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NilWil1972 @christopherhope But with it much closer with Labour now, they will likely let Labour steal seats. And for what? Nothing. It’s just desperation for airtime. I used to respect Nigel, but to exploit covid and push a new party just to be anti lockdown is low.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Farage &amp; Tice just love the attention. Boris has stood firm on Brexit, we left in Jan as promised, we are leaving transition period Dec 31 as promised &amp; he’s standing up to the EU. So Farage decides to exploit covid instead. Reform UK will just let Labour steal lots of seats 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UKlPVoter @GrumpyOldLab @christopherhope It keeps Labour out. Kind of huge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sapgasm @christopherhope But Boris has delivered Brexit, and that’s the thanks he gets. Farage just craves attention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christopherhope So Boris is delivering Brexit, against all the odds, that everyone wanted, yet some Brexiteers now want to abandon him to vote for this new Farage party (all cos of a temp lockdown), which will then let Labour steal lots of seats. Absolutely pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christopherhope Just stinks of desperation for attention. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christopherhope Pointless. After COVID, back to irrelevant, much like they are now after Brexit. Nigel, Tice etc are just desperate for attention and airtime. Pathetic really. By the time the next election comes, covid will be over.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Sparkles8675309 @Reginageorge_L @JoJoFromJerz Have you seen many Trump TV ads lately?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamLowry60 Not particularly great. Pretty much evens. But Biden was fav.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just put a decent size bet on Trump. Now he HAS to win! 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jjmacclad 😂 I’m with you on that! Haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@youdonewhat That I can definitely agree with<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If we see this much chaos right now with #panicbuying in supermarkets, I dread to think of how they will be a week before Christmas. The supermarkets are normally rammed then, but with social distancing, we’ll be in queues for hours and hours. This year just keeps on giving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are so many people #panicbuying. The supermarkets didn’t close last time, they won’t be closing this time. This is getting ridiculous now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time for an early haircut....not being caught out like last time!  💇🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxxysTweets Prediction?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears @O17A03 I agree, it could be yes. But cancelling a 5 yr old going to school for any longer isn’t the answer. It’s also my opinion that the lockdown could have been avoided. Far too many people broke the rules. A lot of the spread is from within people’s homes, that’s all the parties.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears @O17A03 You’d have basically cancelled children’s education a whole year then. That is devastating for certain ages, as they don’t learn any skills, including interacting with others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@berniespofforth Some shouldn’t have acted like children and broken rules that were designed to avoid another damaging lockdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DCBMEP @BBCPolitics What’s the latest for the likes of Pennsylvania, Florida and Wisconsin?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If certain people’s behaviour is anything to go by, we could be in this lockdown for the rest of the year then. 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Says it all. He’ll happily talk about covid every day now until the next election, to hide his miserable record and the fact he supported Corbyn and campaigned to elect him as our PM. He did nothing in the shadow cabinet but yet and block brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer Oh here we go....same old tired record. We all know the reason why we are here, which you’ve made worse by constantly undermining the Government. Do go away. You bring nothing to the table. You keep trying to exploit the crisis, as your shadow cabinet has revealed you’re doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarolineLucas Pipe down with your constant negativity. UK testing more than anybody else in Europe daily. Huge task, done at speed. It’s not all doom and gloom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toadmeister @BritishSos We know where people are catching it, house-parties! But how do you stop #COVIDIOTS from going to those and spreading it further? We are only in this lockdown becuase of selfish people breaking the rules. Spoils it for the rest of us now, who went to pubs safely. #ridge #marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>💯   Education is key to a child’s development. It’s just as much about the social interaction in some cases. When they have missed most of the year, it is critical schools stay open. If teachers don’t want to be there, they are clearly in the wrong job and should leave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boris &amp; the Gov have one simple problem, they are damned if they do &amp; damned if they don’t. They have tried to keep things open, people in work &amp; things as normal as poss, but when people don’t get behind them &amp; follow the rules, they are forced into lockdown. #covididiots #Ridge<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Johanne42580334 So what would you do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Glenco1975 Well, the cases didn’t rise by themselves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Glenco1975 So who’s to blame then!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please remember that Boris &amp; the Government is between a rock and a hard place. Most people are going to hate them no matter what they do. Damned if they do, damned if they don’t. They have to react to public behaviour. Period. #Lockdown2 #Marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course. Not Boris’s fault there are some cun*s in this country, that refused to abide by the rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some people made their beds, now they have to lie in it. Some of us went above &amp; beyond to make things better &amp; to try &amp; avoid #lockdown2, and now we suffer the consequences of dick heads who couldn’t give a sh*t about anybody but themselves. I hope they suffer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’d rather 🇺🇸 election distraction than all this bull:shit....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@francisobrienUK Don’t play those games mate. Let’s be serious, we wouldn’t be in this position if people hadn’t attended indoor parties etc. I understand you want to go for the popular vote, but I’m going down the reality of the situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So should I do a virtually party. Drinks obvs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kappachino1970 Deal 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So who’s coming to my birthday party on 10 November?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon Here we to, change opinions based on which way the wind blows.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kevin_Maguire No it’s not. He was trying to keep the economy open, to save jobs and businesses. Unfortunately, there were more selfish ignorant rule breakers than he realised. #Lockdown2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you’re a teacher demanding that to #closetheschools then you’re in the wrong profession. They’ve been shut most the year. #Lockdown2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, after that announcement from Boris, our Prime Minister, looks like we’re back to the 23 March, just with much crapper weather. Thanks to all the rule breakers that have caused this. I hope those parties &amp;  gatherings were worth it, this is on you #Pressconference #Lockdown2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeverleyG64 Couldn’t agree more. Boris will get the blame, but it is firmly on those ignorant selfish bastards having indoor parties and braking all the rules. Boris trusted the public to comply to prevent #Lockdown2, some couldn’t help themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THIS👇🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biggest cu*t ever👇🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Why don’t you sit in the freezer for a few hours and give us all some peace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Susan_Bpatriot @Speech4allFree Done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClarkeMicah @SheelaghG Labour would happily have us live the rest of the year in lockdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So so true 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanEacock It’s 6 ish now apparently<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnanorth @EssexPR Exactly...it spreads like wildfire. Hence why the mostly young/university students have created this. If they’d stuck to the rules, we wouldn’t be heading into a lockdown again. So many moaning about it have either broken the rules, or haven’t encouraged compliance. I blame them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR @Pavlovsdog86 Maybe we just have too many selfish pricks in this country. Whether we do a lockdown or not, nothing will change if people don’t stop having parties<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR If you’re infected &amp; stick the the rule of six, maximum you can infect is 5 people. You break the rules &amp; go to a party of 40 people, you could infect all those 40. That on a national scale, it’s no wonder things have got worse. It’s basics. You have an agenda, change the record.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Starmist_ It’s not about being perfect, but having a massive house party is clearly selfish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR You knew it was coming. You knew not everyone was complying with the rules. Whether you agreed with the rules or not, you knew compliance was the only thing that could prevent a lockdown. You did nothing to encourage people to follow the rules. Here are the consequences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jn_ady @barbaracantalk What a load of absolute crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m in both. I’m pissed off at a #Lockdown2, but blame the rule breakers. Boris trusted us to all follow the rules and prevent another #lockdown. Too many selfish ignorant idiots having parties. The damage they have done is criminal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kinkswaugh Thanks. I’m just so frustrated as a minority have destroyed so much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A #Lockdown2 will be worse than the first lockdown. We don’t even have warm weather to enjoy the outdoors, or the sight of summer now. It’s dark, cold nights. It will mean we’re all locked up. Why couldn’t everyone just stick to the rules. We could have then avoided this. Idiots!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realBlackInk @HHepplewhite People spread it, not the Government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kinkswaugh November 10th 😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jacks1912s You can barely go anywhere in the world right now, it’s not travel. It’s the house parties. Stats show most nee cases are being spread indoors, in homes. That’s parties. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RockboltG Idiots not adhering to any rule. It’s on them. The country has the opportunity to avoid a lockdown, some took the piss by going to parties and huge gatherings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wicksylax I don’t agree with #lockdown2, but I knew one would come if cases &amp; deaths went too high again. I’m well pissed off cos people played into the hands of the scientists by breaking so many rules and attending indoor parties. It’s on them. They’ve destroyed the economy now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can’t even go to the pub on my birthday now. I stuck to the rules, not cos I wanted too, but to prevent further restrictions on all our lives, people’s jobs &amp; businesses. I really despise those ignorant, selfish people who didn’t follow the rules. They have destroyed so much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>However people try to spin this, it wouldn’t have happened if people had followed the rule of six. Risk of spread is going to be higher if people have indoor parties with tons of people and no social distancing. Boris warned people there would be consequences, here it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Senser3 Police have released stats in some areas, breaking up 000’s of parties. I know of many people going to them. Close contact, indoors, it’s no wonder it’s spread. A lot of it being down to students as well. It was shit for me following the rules, but I did it to prevent a lockdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@enuffsa1d If their family got it and got seriously ill, they’d only blame the government. Honestly, you just can’t make it up. Too many ignorant, selfish people around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For all the people complaining of a potential damaging #Lockdown2, which I don’t want or agree with either, why did you not all follow the rules to prevent one?! I agree a lockdown is damaging, hence why I followed the rules to PREVENT one. Boris trusted everyone to do the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>💯 agree. Problem is, too many people didn’t follow the rules &amp; went to house-parties, which are the worst, being close contact &amp; indoors. It’s now put Boris in an impossible position. I won’t blame him, I’ll blame the ignorant people who have caused the spread. We were warned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jon_statistics @FranWright2 @BorisJohnson No it’ll sit on then ones who didn’t listen and follow the rules. If they had, things could have stayed the same as they did in the summer. It’s not the Governments fault so many people had house parties etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonAshworth Oh you do talk a load of rubbish. A lockdown is the last resort, it could be avoided if people listen and follow the rules. All you did was undermine the Government, thereby increasing the risk of it spreading and forcing us into a lockdown. Labour want to destroy the economy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Senser3 @bbclaurak Well, I’ll care if they close the pubs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ran out of characters 😂 they’re in with street gatherings haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Problem is, reason we are teetering on the verge of #Lockdown2 is because there are a minority in this country who have recklessly not followed the rules. All those super spreader house parties &amp; street gatherings. But they’ll still do the same with a new #lockdown, so no point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewGibsonMBA @Glenco1975 It’s simple maths, that if somebody is infected and they follow the rule of six, maximum they infect is 5 others. If they are reckless and selfish and don’t follow the rules, thereby go to a party of 40, they potentially infect 39 others. Far greater risk of spread.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeninsulaPestCo @anthea_bailey You’re missing a key point. Having mass gatherings and indoor house parties, clearly WILL increase the risk. That’s not rocket science. So anybody that carried on doing so, are selfish. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG. The man has just died and Nicola Sturgeon is already trying to make political points on the death of Sean Connery. The woman has no shame. EVERYTHING to her is an opportunity to exploit, much like the Labour party’s philosophy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mumbomania Flawed science didn’t make people go to house parties, mass gatherings and make people selfish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why couldn’t EVERYONE see that a #lockdown2 would be damaging, &amp; pull together to follow all the rules &amp; AVOID one? Some in this country, who carried on having house/street parties, in my view, are to blame for this. Boris put his trust in the British people, some fu*ked it up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Announced BEFORE Keir Starmer sent his tweet. No doubt he’ll start pretending it’s happening because of what he said. Captain Hindsight can frankly piss off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KirstieMAllsopp Happy Halloween!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanCornwell6 Whether lockdowns work or not is not my point. Most of the increase in cases has come from indoors, it’s all the house parties and gatherings. The student halls etc. It’s not rocket science that as soon as students went back to uni, the weather got worse, cases spread inside.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think we can all agree, this is one grim Halloween. Whatever way you look at this. #HappyHalloween #Lockdown2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>💯 agree. Whether the #Lockdown2 rumours are true or not, the only reason restrictions are getting tighter is because cases, hospital admissions &amp; sadly deaths have shot up. That is on the rule breakers, the selfish pri*ks who went to parties, mass gatherings &amp; protests. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer A press conference has already been announced, so your tweet is a lie. Clear that this tweet is to try and show it was Labour who forced them to do one, whereas, it wasn’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer Bore off, press conference already announced. Do keep up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Glenco1975 What exactly do you disagree with? I don’t agree with another lockdown. So we agree on that. What I’m saying is that the reason cases, hospital admissions and deaths have gone up, is becuase of the people who are spreading it at parties etc. You can’t really deny that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ninahazelby As I said, if rumours are true. I’m sick of the media regardless. They cause so much anxiety and half of what they say is complete bull.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HHepplewhite Isn’t he the complete opposite though. I fear with him he’d ignore anything for his agenda. Think he would be potentially dangerous in health. My opinion tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sean Connery has sadly died. It still feels weird when somebody dies who I’ve watched on TV. #RIP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember, it was in our hands. It needed a joint effort of EVERYONE doing their part to avoid a #Lockdown2. Too many selfish idiots have potentially spoilt it for the rest of us. Boris knows the damage another national lockdown could do, so he trusted everyone to follow the rules<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MCCohill @BettyBowers Good point, be better to spend it in Pennsylvania in my opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mouvement33 You mean because the dem governor stopped more than 250 being let in. There were thousands outside.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MCCohill @BettyBowers Why not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PattyJo00781271 @CHIZMAGA That’s crazy wait. I’m on U.K. and it’s never more than 10 mins as we have so many polling booths. Does that not put off so many from voting?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So many stupid people in this country. Luckily a small minority, but that’s still millions of stupid people. Honestly, the mind boggles sometimes....  https://t.co/WF30k1nlrS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollypops3109 I didn’t ask you to convince me. You make statements that are ridiculous and when I ask a simple question, you can’t answer it. You say Boris wants the economy to be destroyed, but can’t answer how that benefits him. Shows you don’t have a clue what you’re talking about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollypops3109 Can you answer my question. Or are you unable to do so?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexhrbfc I think a Prime Minister has to trust the public, but it’s a shame a minority haven’t followed the rules. I don’t believe a national lockdown is the answer, as Keir Starmer wants. That punishes areas that HAVE followed the rules and listened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollypops3109 More conspiracy theories. Answer me this, what does Boris and the Conservatives have to gain from a destroyed economy and mass unemployment?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears He trusted the public to follow the rules to avoid any national lockdown. So was he wrong to trust people like you to follow the rules? Also, nothing is final yet, these are rumours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollypops3109 That’s right, the Conservatives want to crash the economy, that’ll go down well and get them elected again. You’re on crack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarnieRiptide That will be down the Labour Mayor @SadiqKhan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaxHeadroom68 @kidcobbler @m2odo @SamCoatesSky Before Covid hit, we had record employment, mega low unemployment, deficit was nearly gone, Brexit delivered, so no it wasn’t still shit at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed. Ridiculous to be counting ballots after the election. 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexhrbfc Oh I don’t think that at all, I don’t agree with a national lockdown or a circuit breaker they have introduced in Wales. Cases still going up in Wales, and the Labour Government there are shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaracasFlute @m2odo @SamCoatesSky Actually, there’s a Labour Government in Wales, and they’re SHIT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kidcobbler @m2odo @SamCoatesSky Labour would probably be the iceberg, that’s how much damage they cause when in power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthewbrumby @Josh_Macc We need the virus gone, but also for people to take some responsibility for their own actions. Are any of us ourselves during this pandemic?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexhrbfc Shows that not all the public can be trusted. Labour don’t trust the public, Boris did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t agree with any lockdown 2 &amp; I won’t support it. However, I won’t blame the Government for introducing one. Boris warned everyone 2 months ago of the consequences of not following the rules. I will blame the people breaking the rules, attending house parties, protests etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrDanCarroll We don’t know what he’s doing yet, it’s all rumours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danmcdonxld It’s this kind of behaviour of mass crowds, parties etc that is sending us into a national lockdown. Everyone was warned of the consequences of not following the rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Josh_Macc Because they’re trying to protect lives? I disagree with a national lockdown, massively, by I know they didn’t rule it out if cases/deaths spiralled. Therefore, I stuck to the rules. If you’re one of the rule breakers attending parties etc, any lockdown is on you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonathanMcNam20 @m2odo @SamCoatesSky Government haven’t caused the virus, government hasn’t spread it either. I’ve stuck to the rules, cancelled house-parties and planned nights out. If everyone had done the same, we wouldn’t be teetering on a national lockdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrDanCarroll It’s not a u-turn, they didn’t want to do a lockdown but didn’t rule it out. If you didn’t rule something out, it’s a developing situation. People were given the opportunity to avoid one, some broke the rules &amp; have potentially messed it up! We don’t know what they’ll do yet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexMacca01 @Josh_Macc It’s not Boris who spreads the virus. Whether I agree with a lockdown or not (which I don’t), he warned everyone he would lockdown if cases &amp; deaths went too high. Therefore, that’s a clear warning to avoid a lockdown, you follow the rules. That’s common sense, not blind loyalty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If there is a national lockdown, it’s not a u-turn. Boris never ruled anything out, he instead gave everyone the opportunity to avoid a lockdown, if they followed the Government rules. Some selfish idiots didn’t &amp; went to parties etc. That will be who is to blame. Media bullshit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some people can’t take responsibility for their own actions. Boris gave people the opportunity to avoid a lockdown, but some selfish people didn’t follow the rules, went to protests, had house parties etc. It is them who are to blame for any lockdown, NOT Boris or the Government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@O17A03 Some people can’t take responsibility for their own actions. Boris gave people the opportunity to avoid a lockdown, but some selfish people didn’t follow the rules. Went to protests, had house parties etc. It is them who are to blame for any lockdown, NOT Boris or the Government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Josh_Macc Was waiting for this. People were given the opportunity to avoid another national lockdown by sticking to guidelines, some selfish ppl refused to abide by the rules &amp; attended houseparties. They need to take responsibility for their own actions. Its not Boris’s, nor Gov’s fault.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BritishAlba I’d lock them up. It’s criminal. Not just spreading the virus, but the consequences of potentially forcing the country into another full lockdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some people have let themselves down by having parties etc. We could have avoided a full national lockdown. Boris gave us the opportunity to avoid one, and what did some do, fu*k it up. I’ll be furious if we have another lockdown, but I will firmly blame selfish rule breakers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If rumours are true &amp; Boris does a full national lockdown, it will be down to the selfish people who haven’t been following the rules. It’s the house-parties, mass gatherings &amp; protests. We’ve all seen the videos &amp; pictures. People were warned of the consequences 2 months ago! 😤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@saxover @m2odo @SamCoatesSky Clearly you ain’t so clever then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SueWhitaker11 Thing with Labour, they have no morals. They do everything for their own careers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HHepplewhite I saw it coming last time, I see it again now. I think it will hinge potentially on Pennsylvania<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilthorman @SammyG9 @GJHeducation What trust got to do with anything? Good job you don’t need to then ay. I love the way I’m the one that’s ‘untrustworthy’, yet I’m the one that’s stuck to the rules to help saves lives &amp; to avoid a damaging lockdown. Think you all need to sort out your priorities. Pathetic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GJHeducation @SammyG9 Bringing up Cummings from April isn’t helping anybody right now is it, it’s not the reason we are here. It’s a shit situation, and using Cummings to excuse reckless behaviour is farcical really. I suppose everybody has a reason to excuse anything they do now 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GJHeducation @SammyG9 I think the fact you’re a teacher is the scary part of all of this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@m2odo @SamCoatesSky Labour would be far far worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lynn is right👇🏼A Marxist, Socialist Labour Government in charge of the entire UK. A racist party with Corbyn or Captain Hindsight Starmer leading, flip flopping all over the joint, dictating what we can buy, in charge of Brexit talks, pulling down statues, unpatriotic. Imagine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GJHeducation You know the story, I ain’t going to go through it. If any child was ill, I think it’s perfectly reasonable to go to a hospital, don’t you? To compare Cummings (who did everything in respect of his child) to that of ppl deliberately putting lives at risk with parties, says it all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GJHeducation Lol back onto Cummings. Cummings didn’t mix with anybody, didn’t put lives at risk &amp; certainly didn’t spread anything. He was perfectly within the rules with regards to going north for potential childcare issues. You seriously blame him for people having house-parties? Grow up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤷🏼‍♂️ No idea! He’s back on those pills keeping him awake....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realsb4feelings The Government can’t step in for every daily event. It runs the country, but not specific issues in town and cities. As I said, the met police is Labour Mayors job. It’s about time @SadiqKhan started doing his job. Now I do want the Gov to get involved and dissolve his position.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realsb4feelings The Labour Mayor controls the Police in London, on a day to day basis. Boris can’t deal with every issue, across the whole of the UK on a day to day basis 🙄 That’s the whole point of Mayors etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is very strange. Is this true or has somebody got into doctoring photos?   If true, I’d like to know why suddenly the BBC have taken another vile left turn. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears Yes, very much so. I believe it will be hugely damaging. I also believe it could have been avoided, if people had decided not to attend parties, mass gatherings and protests. It’s very much brought on by a few selfish idiots, who thought they could do what they want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour really is reliant on the unions. No thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK This story is bullshit. The only places that have had Tier 3 in place long enough to see if it’s working is Liverpool, and cases are massively falling. Desperate for a story @DailyMailUK? Take a few weeks to see if it’s working.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OpiniumResearch @JamesEnders How does Biden lead the economy and jobs?! He wants the whole country shut down, fracking and oil eliminated etc etc. The fake news media have done a good job on the electorate if this is true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears I had only 1 year left in London before I was due to move. It’s affected us all. But I see day in day out, the same ones majorly breaking the rules, are the same ones moaning about a potential lockdown. They will also all go home to parents/grandparents at Xmas, watch it spike<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Well all of those people in the video breaking rules should be banned from seeing parents or grandparents then. They want it both ways. Then blame the Gov if their loved ones die. You may only be young once, but being young isn’t just for one year ffs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears Well all of those people in the video breaking rules should be banned from seeing parents or grandparents then. They want it both ways. Then blame the Gov if their loved ones die. You may only be young once, but being young isn’t just for one year ffs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Josh_Macc @JoshSmithSpears That’s bollocks. I’ve not been able to go out like I used too, I’ve had house-parties cancelled, my house warming and many many nights out. But at the end of the day, we’re meant to be in it together. We’ve all had our lives affected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InspGadgetBlogs Well this isn’t allowed is it. It’s down the the Labour Mayor to get the Met Police out. Why say it’s allowed, when it clearly isn’t. Grow up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears @lukerobertblack I agree it’s minor to under 44, but there are clearly people breaking the rules, attending indoor parties who are young, then mixing with older people. That’s out of order. It will send us into a devastating lockdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely shameful. Where’s the police? It seems very selective in their London operation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears @lukerobertblack Well, that’s not the case all over, otherwise it wouldn’t have spread to them. Also, people will start mixing more the closer Xmas gets. The more people have it, the higher the risk of more older people getting it. It could have been contained if ppl had followed the rule of 6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIZMAGA Be nice for him to meet his supporters there tho!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears @lukerobertblack So you wore as mask to that party then? I don’t think so. Tons of 18-25 yr old are not wearing masks at indoor parties etc. Then it spreads, and eventually that starts leaking out to older ppl, esp in the run up to Xmas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears @lukerobertblack So how are they getting it then? There’s a clear spread gradually. Also, how are the young going to stay away from anybody over 60 at Christmas. They arnt! Hence why they need to stop spreading it at parties, now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lukerobertblack @JoshSmithSpears Maybe the younger generations shouldn’t be spreading it to the old then. Problem solved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adsantweets @NeilDotObrien There always going to be a higher risk of spread if your at a house party indoors with 30 people. It’s basic fact that the risk will increase, hence it being lowered sticking to the 6 person rule. I’m sick of people moaning, when it’s the same people going to a full blown party<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears Once. You could have had it before, it got it the next day. Unless you are tested daily, you can’t say you have never had it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you attended house parties, large gatherings, broke the rules in a way that risked the spread, you have no right to moan at any potential national lockdown. Boris warned of the consequences of not following the rules months ago. Increase in deaths, hospital cases is on you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears You don’t know that. Anybody could have had it, not shown symptoms, not known and then spread it. You moan about the potential of a second national lockdown, but you did the very thing that has increased cases &amp; hospital admissions, by attending large parties.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears Tier 3 base restrictions, most have more. PLUS, if people had followed the rules, we wouldn’t have needed tier 3 at all. It’s only spread because of all the indoor parties, gatherings etc. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting annoyed about the people who are complaining the most about the potential national lockdown, being the ones that have been breaking all the rules &amp; attending house parties/large gatherings. You have lost the moral high-ground. Boris warned of the consequences 2 MONTHS AGO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears But we wouldn’t be potentially going into a second national lockdown if everyone had stuck to the rules. That, is what will wreck the economy the most. We could have kept it like the summer, but far too many thought they could break the rules with no consequences<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears Well that’s understandable. He warned us of the consequences of not following the rules 2 MONTHS AGO! Too many people having indoor parties etc. The only people to blame for any lockdown, will be the ones who went to parties &amp; mass gatherings. I cancelled all mine,as did my mates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears Anybody else and you’d be fully locked down, likes Labour run Wales. You’d also be banned from buying certain things in the supermarkets. I thought you didn’t like socialism and Marxists?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParkerTerd Heard a few stories like that. Don’t surprise me tho!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BritainElects @RedfieldWilton Hasn’t this come down in support for a national lockdown?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We all knew that Labour’s @AndyBurnhamGM was playing games with people’s lives. His game playing and politics point scoring has undoubtedly cost lives. Good job Boris put an end to his virtue signalling and forced Manchester into Tier 3. This is no time for Labour’s games.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy Friday folks!!!! Who’s got that #FridayFeeling?  https://t.co/zEDw9gUten<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do find it funny how anybody is willing to vote for Biden. He can barely string a sentence together, his plans don’t add up, he dodges any serious questions, and there is plenty of footage that shows that he’s a compulsive liar. He has barely campaigned this election 🙄🤷🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone give the below account a follow. Conservative and proud brexiteer👇🏼🇬🇧  @Happy_days_72<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If they are entering Tier 3, then they are already at Tier 2, which includes the standard rule of six, not socially mixing indoors etc. So what the hell is all that👇🏼I’m sorry, but I do blame the young for us teetering on the verge of another national lockdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Femi_Sorry Nobody would have gone out without the discounts. Jobs would have been lost, business bust.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrantTucker It kept millions in jobs and saved many businesses, so no. I also believe the majority who used the scheme, did so in a safe way, surely yours is the most stupid tweet of the day?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This👇🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrumpWarRoom So unacceptable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SocialM85897394 😂 somehow, if Trump wins, I don’t think it’ll be down to Farage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not Corbyn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nobody wants this current Labour Party in power, corrupt and racist to the eyeballs. Corbyn has infected the whole party, his front bench all stood by and did nothing. Starmer stood by &amp; watched people get driven out of the party, then campaigned to put Corbyn as PM. #bbcqt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@susiesale6 I feel for you, my mums going mad in Wales atm. Labour dictatorship needs to be voted out next year!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Days like this, I’m so thankful we have @BorisJohnson and the @Conservatives in Government. 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anybody noticed that all of Keir Starmers cabinet are now saying that when it comes to Corbyn, he just had a ‘blind spot’ when it came to anti semitism. What a crock of sh*t. Many of these people like Rayner &amp; Starmer did absolutely nothing. Labour are still an absolute disgrace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Captain Hindsight stood by throughout it all, did nothing, while being one of the closest people to Jeremy Corbyn. Keir Starmer just spent all his time either campaigning to put Corbyn into No10, or coming up with new ways to block #Brexit &amp; push for a second referendum. ❌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@powertoimpeach @realDonaldTrump They should vote by the election. If they can’t get their ballots back in time, they vote in person. Not hard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@Keir_Starmer has no morals. He does what he wants, for his own career. He knew exactly what was going on when Corbyn was leader, he backed him, served in his cabinet &amp; campaigned to make him Prime Minister, whilst trying to defy the referendum result. He isn’t a leader. Fraud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Melissa5857 It’s all about him. No integrity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can’t stand Angela Rayner. She changes her morals daily to suit her agenda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This👇🏼   Starmer is just trying to save his own skin now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Melissa5857 @Keir_Starmer Starmer is only doing it to save himself. He knows Corbyn will bring him down otherwise. Starmer stood by Corbyn throughout last year, campaigned for him, knowing all of this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rachael_Swindon Good riddance. He’ll never be allowed back in as he’s now toxic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vote Trump 🇺🇸   UK economy likely to rebound massively in the third quarter too.   Any national lockdown would destroy that. It must be avoided at all costs, but for that to happen, we need to follow the rules from Government, or risk a miserable Christmas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is Corbyn still part of the Labour Party?   Why does Starmer ignore unacceptable behaviour by his own Labour MPs?   Why did Starmer try to elect Corbyn as PM, knowing he had ignored the antisemitism engulfing the party.   @Keir_Starmer isn’t new leadership.  Sickening👇🏼  https://t.co/OLqKlhcpoN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh look, #WeAreCorbyn is trending. Says it all. Labour truly are a nasty party. They don’t have new leadership in Keir Starmer, he’s the same person who stood next to Corbyn, backing him up, standing by when all the antisemitism went on. He was too fixated with stopping Brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just read the Corbyn statement. He still believes antisemitism was hyped. Delusional. He takes no responsibility whatsoever. Absolutely no shame.   Will Keir Starmer expel him? I doubt it. He too, buries his head in the sand on unacceptable behaviour in the Labour Party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lewis_goodall @tinkernurse But then sits back and does nothing. Bit like Starmer did when he stood side by side with Corbyn. Wasn’t Starmer part of the problem then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bonjour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Definitely agree with this. Abolish the Labour Party - they are rotten to the core. Incompetent to the highest level and absolutely no leadership.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A few things to note on the Labour Party leadership....  Keir Starmer wants you to forget that he was the architect of Labour’s second referendum policy, ignoring the referendum result of the people. He now wants you to forget that he stood by &amp; endorsed Corbyn for PM #EHRCReport<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Labour Party hasn’t changed under Keir Starmer. It’s the same old nasty, racist, antisemitic party, as it was under Corbyn.   We have @SadiqKhan, @DawnButlerBrent &amp; @DavidLammy pushing racial divides. Many others pushing class wars and Angela Rayner calling people ‘scum’.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Labour Party is rife with racism &amp; antisemitism. It doesn’t just stop now the EHRC report has been published, or because Corbyn isn’t leader.   Keir Starmer doesn’t even take decisive action on his MPs brandishing other MPs ‘scum’.   Labour is the same old cesspit of trash.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour are rotten to the core.   Corbyn should resign as an MP for the way he did nothing. What he and Labour have done is truly awful, but the even sadder thing....  Keir Starmer doesn’t take decisive action either on issues or unacceptable behaviour either. #EHRCReport<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can we not just abolish them as a party now then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Tucker   VOTE Trump America 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking forward to the release of the #EHRC. Been a long time coming, just hope it exposes the level of #LabourAntisemitism &amp; something is done about it. Very much doubt anything will change. Keir Starmer is useless, he’s ignored all issues/behaviour in the party lately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yuck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIZMAGA What’s the deficit for mail in ballots ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And some wonder why cases have gone up...it’s these selfish people that will have us all in lockdown come Christmas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BJ_Gardener @piersmorgan Brexit is worth every penny to be out of that corrupt, threatening EU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂😂😂   https://t.co/8hSkXyqxy5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree. A full national lockdown would be a disaster, far too many consequences, like business going bust, job losses, cancelled operations &amp; a mental health disaster. Stick to what you’re doing Boris. Let’s all get behind the Gov, follow the rules &amp; tell @piersmorgan  to fu*k off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whatever you think of Trump, you can’t deny the media in America (as well as the UK, are biased and corrupt). The likes of CNN have basically wall to wall negative coverage of Trump and constant positive stories about Biden. It’s ridiculous!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@avamariabee @piersmorgan If we all follow the rules, we don’t. Too many selfish people breaking them tho. Lockdown will create its own problems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@avamariabee @piersmorgan It’s as simple as follow the rules, and then we won’t need a full second national lockdown. It’s selfish people causing all this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let the national lockdown in France &amp; Germany be a warning. Our Government have warned us that it doesn’t want to do a second national lockdown &amp; Boris is resisting so far. BUT be in no doubt, there will be consequences if we don’t follow the rules &amp; get hospital admissions down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish @piersmorgan would piss off. A rich celeb wanting ordinary working class people locked up indefinitely. Just because France or Germany do a national lockdown, doesn’t mean we have to follow. Full lockdowns do so much damage, we are already in the most debt since the war.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I support @BorisJohnson &amp; the  Government in what it is doing. It is trying to protect lives, whilst also trying to keep the economy open, businesses from going bust &amp; people from losing their jobs. I don’t however support a national lockdown like France &amp; Germany are doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think we all know what the media are going to say now. Why is the UK not doing another national lockdown like France &amp; Germany. You can almost smell their excitement at the next narrative. ‘Boris is too slow to react’ will be the line. The economy has an impact on health too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>France set to enter second national lockdown 👀👀  https://t.co/yAgIVjnAgk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Celtics11_0 @CHIZMAGA Exactly. If more republican people are voting in person early, there’s going to be less of them on Election Day voting. Nobody can be sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1️⃣ TfL is your responsibility and any increase is down to you.  2️⃣ You don’t seem to take responsibility for any of your failures.  3️⃣ Why only mention BAME-owner businesses? What about white-owned businesses? Screw them then is it? They don’t matter. Disgusting attitude.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon It’s you that’s doing it. What exactly do you positively do again?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onthanopalsko @CHIZMAGA That’s good then!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon Fix London’s issues, isn’t that your job?!? You’re currently failing at everything in London. You’ve broken promises and failed to deliver. Let alone bankrupting the transport network. Stop trying to distract from your incompetency!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIZMAGA Yes but is Biden increasing his lead in mail in votes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No no no. It would mean areas with low levels of covid having their economy damaged unnecessarily. Full lockdowns also have very severe consequences on livelihoods, businesses, jobs and mental health. It needs to be specifically targeted, with everyone following the rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#EatOutToHelpOut kept millions in jobs, that could have been lost otherwise. If those jobs had been lost, there would have been many more people unable to provide for their family. It also helped keep businesses afloat. Labour are the party of virtue signalling, not solutions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Working from home is losing its shine for me.... missing the office now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has @MarkDrakeford got nothing better to do, than send pointless letters? 🤷🏼‍♂️   If he spent more time dealing with the issues in Wales, rather than virtue signalling &amp; introducing such ridiculous policies, that dictate what people can &amp; can’t buy, we might not be in this position.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If rumours are true &amp; more places likely to go into lockdowns, it will be down to the people in those areas who haven’t been following the rules. We’ve all seen the rule breaking &amp; how the police are forced to break up parties. People were warned of the consequences 2 months ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has to be @RishiSunak all the way. He’s been doing a fantastic job, in the most dreadful times. An impossible task to do, damned if he doesn’t, damned if he does. I think the fact we see many personal attacks on him, shows he’s clearly doing a good job &amp; has rattled Labour. #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like Danny Dyer, but he really shouldn’t get involved in politics. End of the day, we have elected representatives, many of them are working class from within in the Conservative Party. I’m happy we have Boris as PM, not a typical politician, he gets us working folk. #PMQs  https://t.co/jK7pjcAeHD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vivjones10 @realDonaldTrump Depends what ones you look at, however, in same battleground states, there seems to be an uptick slightly for Trump....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Nailed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexhrbfc @SadiqKhan @DavidLammy @DawnButlerBrent I’m just stating fact in general. They do stoke division, all the time. That’s what causes people to be scared to say things sometimes. It’s not politicising anything, it’s stating my opinion. It’s the Labour Party that exploits things. Lammy is already at it tonight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. Just wow. Is this what it’s come too? I blame Labour for all this racial divide. The likes of @SadiqKhan, @DavidLammy and @DawnButlerBrent are some of the worst for trying to create racial and class wars. They should be ashamed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vote Trump America 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon What bit of what I said was untrue? It’s incredibly sad they died, that wasn’t my point and you know it. My point was that Sadiq Khan is lying saying they’re fleeing war and persecution from France. Fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes @pritipatel!!! 👏🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Lot more work to do, but good start. People need to know how corrupt Biden is. Lying through his teeth from one day to the next.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon Lies. They are not fleeing war or persecution coming from the likes of France.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are not fleeing war or persecution coming from the likes of France. To say they are, is a complete lie. Typical Labour politician, lying through his teeth...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boom! 🇬🇧 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears I had the last one, what happened to that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears Put it on here 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HorshamGardener They won’t unless the things I stated go down. Hence why I think we should all follow the rules atm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@errjustsaying @standardnews What do you think? I’d be inclined to say normal non voters would go to Trump...and they’ll vote on the day itself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@standardnews @errjustsaying So are the non voters from 2016 going to vote for Trump or Biden?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HorshamGardener I’d like a Christmas without Tier 2,3 or 4 restrictions thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@turquoise1112 The only reason we have such tough restrictions is because far too many people, mostly the young, didn’t follow the rules and had house parties and mass gatherings. It’s nobody’s fault but the ones who didn’t follow the rules in September/October.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To the 50 Tory MPs asking Boris for a road map out of tough restrictions, I have one simple thing to say, it’s as simple as follow the rules. If everyone follows the rules to get cases, hospital admissions &amp; the R rate down, restrictions can be lifted. Everyone work together!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kirstiealley Who do you think will win?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPJHodges @philiprichards5 He doesn’t even what day it is, or whether he’s going for the senate or even trumps name.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InWicc @johnestevens @realsb4feelings Not going to share as it’s personal, but it’s been made clear how much they are getting from UC and they are confused as to why the media are pushing this narrative that the Government arnt providing any financial support, which is clearly a lie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can the @BBCNews &amp; @itvnews ask some families what they are spending the extra benefits on, if they aren’t spending it on food? Government has increased benefits by putting billions extra into the welfare system, as well as giving councils millions to support those in need. Ta!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Conveniently, Mr Bias himself leaves out it’s the Labour Welsh Government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Conveniently left out it is the Labour Government in Wales.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour Government in Wales is making a complete disaster of things. Dictating what people can and can’t buy is ridiculous and completely unacceptable. I hear in this case though, it’s been resolved. After investigation, it seems the ban was only for a short period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FTP1996 @BritishAlba @DanielJHannan Exactly, even though they already funded it indirectly too. It’s all one big PR stunt. The vote last week was a stunt too. People want free stuff and money constantly, now they want if three times for the same thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@k_gdwn @Country24291070 Even if it doesn’t, the billions put into the welfare system goes directly to the parents. Are they not spending it on food?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>8k retweets on this meaningless tweet from Rashford (aka his PR agency). When Gov announces more money for things, hardly any retweets. Sheer virtue signalling, as school meals outside of term time has already been funded by Gov, either through councils or/&amp; by extra benefits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PDF53 @anthea_bailey @MarcusRashford I agree, but let’s be serious, the media, celebs and Labour would still have done that publicity stunt vote last week, and so we’d still be in the same place today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bexibettyboo1 @PDF53 @anthea_bailey @MarcusRashford Problem is, they have so much on, having to rebut Labour, media and celebs playing politics is such a waste of time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@k_gdwn @Country24291070 I think you can’t fund the same thing three times. People saying they have to fund it directly, but it’s been funded indirectly already via councils &amp; extra money in benefits. The talk of a u-turn because of many being unable to understand the facts, is quite frankly, ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BritishAlba @DanielJHannan But it’s already been paid for, both in money given to councils and billions into the welfare system. It’s now going to be kid for a third time. It’s getting ridiculous!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have a nation unable to grasp &amp; understand that #FreeSchoolMeals outside of term time, HAS already been funded via councils &amp; the welfare system. There has been Gov support. If a u-turn comes because of the sheer virtue signalling, meals are basically being funded three times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kateferguson4 @uncleporkie Take the money out of the billions already put into the welfare system. Can’t have the money twice, or three times if you count the extra money gone into councils too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I fear that covid and associated lockdowns and furlough, has made people expect constant free money all the time now. It’s like we’ve gone back to the days of unlimited benefits under Labour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthea_bailey Agree. The Government has given way more than the cost of free school meals outside of term time in extra money for councils and the welfare system. Yet because it wasnt direct, they get bombarded in the media. Can’t have the money twice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the Government does u-turn on free school meals outside term time, it should take the money out of the extra funds it had already put into the welfare system. Can’t have it both ways. The Government has funded it via councils and the welfare system instead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seaningle And the PR company he has doing his tweets etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did love this when it came out. Had me in stitches! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keithboykin Whatever you think of Trump, Biden has been caught lying about fracking, oil, social security and medicare. Blatant lying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HKrassenstein One that blatantly lies all the time. Not really a good look saying one thing to people, then on TV saying something else and denying what you originally said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthewjdowd What I don’t get is how 58% trust Biden, when if you watch previous videos of him saying things, he’s clearly a liar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billscher Didn’t pick up the surge until a week before tho....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DFBHarvard Agree. Though the polls are making me jittery....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DPJHodges @fitalass I don’t call it desperate, I call it trying to be the President of all of America and reach most areas, rather than Biden being invisible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤣😂  This is why Labour’s policy is so ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCNews Why does it state free school meals, the whole conversation is about meals outside of school term. The Government has already fully funded free school meals. Even meals outside of school term, the Gov is giving councils funding to help. This is so misleading.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@notronomis @witherjay Called a name? It’s called setting an example in Parliament. I woudnt call a colleague scum regardless of whether I agreed with them or not.

<|startoftext|>People need to clue themselves up with the facts on the whole Marcus Rashford campaign, before shouting their mouth off. Comms may have been poor, but the support &amp; extra funding the Government have put into both Councils &amp; the benefits systems this year is billions #Marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcCorbishley Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Enough is enough. The Welsh Labour Government are destroying the economy, jobs, livelihoods &amp; mental health in Wales. Dictating what is &amp; what isn’t ‘essential’ is just plain wrong &amp; nothing to do with covid. It’s far too controlling. Unfair &amp; unjust. Labour have to go. #Marr<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We may all need to stick together to defeat the virus, but we should also all stick together to defeat you and the Labour Welsh Government. (Elections are in May for Welsh 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 voters)   Some things you are doing, is nothing to do with covid, it’s about Labour control in Wales.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarthyBernard @MarcusRashford It’s called UC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is Labour socialism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that was a nice escape getting drunk at a mates....back to normality! Way past Government curfew 😂   Don’t forget, clocks go back tonight.... shame we can’t spring forward a few months and be out of this ghastly pandemic and in a club dancing likes there’s no tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JD041965 @lynn_taylor503 Wales is run by a Marxist, Socialist, Labour dictatorship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy Saturday night folks. Britain might be very different at the moment, and certain things definitely don’t make sense, but we must take time out to at least try and take our minds off things. Keep smiling. I’m off to get drunk!  🍷 🍻 #SaturdayVibes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People getting angry with Welsh Labour for banning the sale of ‘non essential’ items. I don’t blame the guy to be fair. It’s a ridiculous policy by the Labour Government in Wales. It’s not for health reasons, it’s control. This is what a UK led Labour Government would look like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To clarify, that is the Welsh Labour Government. @MarkDrakeford and Labour on a power trip.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaybo_n @NufcEngland1966 @BBCNews I know it’s the tax payers money, my point is, Government have given support. Not that the media would have you believe that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobWilson_RDG 🤞🏼 If not, we can vote Labour out in the Welsh Government elections next year!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stokieadam @stuartmitton1 You do realise BILLIONS extra was put into the welfare system. That means people get more money to pay for food through their benefits<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@callytaylor Labour Welsh Government is on a power trip.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Siany76 @ThisisDavina This is the Welsh Labour Government for you. It’s disgusting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tommylions56 Before covid, under the Tories we had record employment, very low unemployment etc. And you think he just wants to destroy it all? So tell me, what is the great reset then? What does he gain from it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tommylions56 Why would Boris want to close the economy? That wont get him votes. If the economy is damaged, thousands of jobs are lost, he won’t get re-elected. So why would he want the economy destroyed? That’s ridiculous to suggest that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tommylions56 I know politics thanks. This pandemic has given a lot more power to the devolved nations. It’s unprecedented. Normally the Tories in UK Government would manage the economy for the whole UK. However, this pandemic has allowed Labour in wales to close down the economy for ‘health’.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tommylions56 You said that picture was part of his response. It’s not, it’s not in England, if it was, you’d feel it. Don’t mislead, it takes any credibility you have. Tbh, keeping this post up is inaccurate. But that’s your choice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tommylions56 You know it’s classed as a health issue. But regardless, your point was that stopping people buying cards etc was crazy. I agree, but that was not Boris’s idea or decision. Boris hasn’t done that in England. So why let Labour get away with it and target Boris? I don’t get that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIZMAGA How do you know? Great news if true though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tommylions56 All covid restrictions are related to health, that’s devolved to the Labour Welsh Government. Boris can’t do anything, it’s the same as Scotland is run by Sturgeon &amp; SNP Government. You can’t blame Boris for decisions by Labour Government in Wales. We don’t have this in England.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarethGLHQ @Phoebejoy1611 Labour are a disgrace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tommylions56 I suggest you correct your tweet, at least be accurate. The Labour Welsh Government have locked down Wales and banned the sale of non essential items. I agree, it’s crazy, but it’s not Boris.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tommylions56 This is Wales, that’s run by LABOUR!!! Nothing to do with Boris Johnson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iromg I think a Kiev would make a better leader than Keir Starmer to be honest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LabourLeaver @GiftCee @BBCNews Good questions 🤷🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aaabenjwhite @myerschrismyer1 It’s a lot more complex than that, but as I said, there is government support if needed. Isn’t that what the whole conversation is about?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aaabenjwhite @myerschrismyer1 If there are hungry children, it’s must be down to the parents not feeding them then as they should. The parents have the money and support from Government, it’s there if they need it. There is unprecedented support atm, inc more from UC etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickurrz @BBCNews The Gov have given direct funding for things like food poverty. Billions of Government funding has also gone into the welfare system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amandamilling @Keir_Starmer @AngelaRayner Thank you @amandamilling. I would like to add, it’s also had a major impact on the abuse some of us now get on twitter too. Some can take the abuse, but others can’t. It’s simply not acceptable. It’s almost legitimised it. Labour are a disgrace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrendaWolton @ghost_wales No joke. I don’t know why I’m surprised, this is Labour when they get a bit of power. Covid has allowed them way too much power in Wales to do whatever they want. They hide behind ‘health reasons’. It F all to do with covid, it’s controlling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColinDyckes 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thisisnothappen Councils have been given billions by Government to cover different things. 63m directly to help with food poverty. The Government has also put billions extra into the welfare system to help with struggling families for food. There’s a link on one of my tweets on my profile.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NWJK Horrific isn’t it. Somebody I know said earlier how she knows somebody who had a house fire, if that were to happy now, they’d not be able to buy stuff like clothing &amp; bedding. It’s beyond. It wasn’t even like this in March &amp; April, when covid was far worse. Labour are disgusting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBradley_Mans The same Angela Rayner who called another MP ‘scum’ this week. This has since caused a toxic explosion of lefties attacking people all over twitter. Kinda gentler politics from the Labour left ay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KingBobIIV Problem is, many don’t. Most glance at a heading and will assume it’s Tory with that header.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KingBobIIV This is in Wales, run by Labour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aaabenjwhite @myerschrismyer1 Poorest children are supported. Child tax credits/benefits &amp; universal credit are given to help pay for food. End of the day, the state is not responsible for funding all meals through the school holidays, that’s a parents role. If in desperate need, there is Gov help available.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Deviates @BBradley_Mans @MarcusRashford It’s enough to feed a child. To say children will starve when there is so much financial support to those that need it, is false.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@libbeyjude @BBCNews They’ve been given EXTRA funding just this week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Deviates @BBradley_Mans @MarcusRashford The Government has given councils EXTRA funding for this. It has also put billions EXTRA into the welfare system. Parents can get universal credits, child tax credits and extra support if they need it. The councils are also encouraged to support with the extra money they’ve had<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon @MarcusRashford Stepped in? The Government has given these Councils you mention billions in funding. This is how they are able to fund FSM and do this. Without Gov funding, they couldn’t. So they haven’t stepped in, they’ve already been given the money’s to support the most vulnerable families.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden If that’s the case, can’t vote for Biden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>💯🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 @Conservatives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Deviates @BBradley_Mans @MarcusRashford How are kids starving if the Government is giving billions to councils to support the most vulnerable families, parents get child tax credits and universal credit. There is Government support. So how exactly do the parents not have the money with all that support from Gov?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SueWhitaker11 @sandieshoes Absolutely ridiculous. The Government is giving billions to council to support the poorest families and businesses are getting millions in support too. Clearly a staunch Labour supporter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jay_Beecher Chop chop 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just heard @BBCNews say that regarding the Marcus Rashford campaign, local Councils have ‘stepped in’ to provide free school meals, when the Government wouldn’t. Yet those Councils are paying for those meals with the funding they’ve had from....the Government!! Can’t make it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBradley_Mans @MarcusRashford Well said Ben!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking at the tweets from Marcus Rashford today, he’s clearly unaware that the Government is funding Councils, which enable them to fund meals directly. That's the whole point. Gov has given billions to Councils to directly support the most vulnerable families.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBradley_Mans Media won’t report this. Doesn’t fit their agenda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THIS👇🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mikey1732 I think alcohol is essential when under a Labour led Welsh Government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have to give Labour credit for one thing they have done in Wales.  They have categorised alcohol as an ‘essential’ item to buy in the supermarket. They must know themselves that under a Labour Welsh Government, everyone needs alcohol to get through it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NWJK @ghost_wales I think alcohol is essential with Labour in charge mind 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeslieH24367191 Agree, he was awful. Hence why I hope it has huge ratings<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ghost_wales  https://t.co/dAKAiAudtt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ghost_wales And bedding. Apparently it’s not essential in winter. It’s beyond now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RhonddaBryant Who made the Labour Party god to decide what is and isn’t ‘essential’. How can you possibly say the likes of bedding in winter isn’t essential? This is Labour drunk on power in Wales. State control.  https://t.co/pFgF5q4EPu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amazon sales will be up. Labour run Wales is turning into a dictatorship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrantTucker This is Labour control for you. They are out of control in Wales. Drunk on power since the pandemic began.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoePorterUK Think we’ve all been called it this week then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Streakyblue1951 Exactly. They said on sky news earlier they don’t seem a hairdryer to be essential. But what if you work in tv, your hair dryer broke and then you can’t buy a new one. It’s disgusting. Labour are a disgrace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@n_thrope Labour have become nazis in wales. Dictatorship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought you had some common sense and intelligence, @sajidjavid. This is a big mistake in my eyes and I do believe Biden would be catastrophic for Britain in trade talks. Biden can barely string a sentence together atm as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sajidjavid @Telegraph Bye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Government is providing billions of extra welfare support, as well as paying the bulk of wages. It provides child tax credits &amp; universal credit for the poorest families. Sir Marcus Rashford wants taxpayers to pay even more, rather than him &amp; his rich football mates contribute.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Josh_Macc Ok, so what would you do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Josh_Macc I agree mental health is an issue, but so is protecting the elderly. That means not letting it get out of hand. I think it’s very balanced. They ain’t letting it rip, then ain’t doing a national lockdown like Labour want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Josh_Macc It’s all about ‘young’ people to you then? Fuck everyone else. I doubt young people liked going to war, but they did it for their country. So why are the young now spreading it to the older people? It’s clearly happening. To simply say it’s just the young is ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Josh_Macc Government has been in less than 11 months &amp; most of that has been with a pandemic. Failing the economy? So you would open it all up then? If you did that, hospitals would fill up &amp; there would be less room for cancer patients. You’re delusional thinking there’s an easy answer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Government is doing everything it can to drive down cases &amp; to stop hospital admissions &amp; deaths spiralling. It is also trying to protect the economy as much as it can.   An impossible task. They are damned if they do and damned if they don’t. Let’s all do our bit yea? #bbcqt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ghost_wales Omg. I hope you’ve tanked up at the pub. Makes my blood boil, even after a pub outing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ghost_wales @LindaBEdger Keep it up mate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iromg you’re a man with a sensible opinion, what do you think of everything going on in Wales that the Labour are introducing? Not only are Labour locking the whole of Wales down, but supermarkets can only sell ‘essential’ items now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂😂😂 I shouldn’t laugh, but Labour are a joke. How anybody could vote for them is beyond parody. They are destroying Wales.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You want to be independent though? And yet 700m isn’t enough? Come on Nicola, why don’t you tell the truth. Scotland can’t afford to go it alone. Better off as one 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Lefties everywhere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sick of the Labour Party &amp; loony lefties not only trying to divide this country &amp; start a race war, but are also desperately trying to start a class war as well.

<|startoftext|>@AndyBurnhamGM Absolute rubbish. If Manchester was in Tier 2 restrictions as you say for 3 months, very strange how the pubs &amp; bars were packed out.

<|startoftext|>Boris and Rishi do bounce off each other well. Love these two!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very frustrated that whatever the Government does, it’s still not good enough for some. Damned if they do, damned if they don’t. They are doing everything they can to stop hospital admissions &amp; deaths spiralling, whilst also trying to protect the economy &amp; jobs. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seeing a lot of ‘Young Tories’ that have completely lost their mind during this pandemic. Clear sign of a lack of maturity coming out in some, showing how little to no good they are in a crisis.

<|startoftext|>@Josh_Macc Many would have said that about Thatcher at many points early on, but arnt you a Thatcherite?

<|startoftext|>.@Conservatives doing what it can to help the economy, businesses &amp; people get through this crisis. I am proud of the unprecedented support that @RishiSunak &amp; @BorisJohnson have been giving. Labour on the other hand, just do media stunts &amp; political games to exploit the crisis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is pure virtue signalling. Government provides lots of support to help the poorest feed their kids. There is universal credit &amp; child tax credits. So if the kids are hungry, what is the money spent on? Fundamentally, responsibility lies with the parents. #FreeSchoolMeals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatyJayne101 Why would they #EatNowtToHelpOut, if their parents get UC &amp;/or child tax credits? Those benefits are there to help the poorest feed their kids. If the children aren’t being fed when the parents are getting financial help, then the parents are shirking responsibility.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mannyldn_93 @BBCPolitics Parents do get help though, in for form of child tax credits and UC. To simply say they don’t, is a lie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Easy for opposition parties &amp; non elected politicians to say, very different trying to balance the needs of everyone. There is support available for the poorest kids, such as UC &amp; child tax credits, so no child should go hungry. Fundamentally, the responsibility is the parents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCEssex Last week you were begging for Tier 2, or was that just for the money?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WelshLabour @AngelaRayner Angela is off her nut. Closing down the whole economy in Wales, with most businesses shut, with limited financial support, is not the way to go. Nor does it make sense for areas with next to no cases to be locked down. Labour policy is crazy. England has a far better strategy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR A minority of 60m, could be 5m not observing the rules. So to you, 5m having house parties etc won’t spread the virus &amp; it will have no effect on number of cases. Nor will individual behaviour 🙄 I know Piers Morgan has lost it to one extreme, you’re going to the other extreme.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sept 2019 - A Tory MP uses the word "humbug" in Parliament. A moral outrage erupts from the left.   Oct 2020 - Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner calls a Tory MP "scum".

<|startoftext|>@0_politics2 Yuck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR To say spike in cases is nothing to do with individual behaviour is ridiculous. If a person has it, doesn’t self isolated, it has an effect. You can clearly see cases amongst the young jumped through Sept/Oct. That is the behaviour of students going to uni, having parties etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR The problem, as you know, is it spreading mostly in homes. So solution is to encourage people not to break the rule of six etc (aka no house parties, mass gatherings), R rate goes down, hospitality restrictions lifted, economy opens. Or encourage rule breaking &amp; things get worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR And by you constantly moaning about the restrictions &amp; yet doing nothing to encourage people to work together, to get cases down/things better, all you do is increase the likelihood of us being stuck in these restrictions for longer. You’re turning into a Piers with an agenda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR It’s true tho. If some people hadn’t been breaking them so much with houseparties &amp; mass gatherings, we wouldn’t have Tier 2 &amp; 3 right now. The only way we’ll get rid of restrictions, is by getting the R back down &amp; thus following the rules now, whether you like it or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellGardner 😂 I’ve had a lot of shit today too, most since stormzy was on the Brits haha. Some nasty lefty trolls on here, just let it go over your head.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR None of these rules would have been brought in if people had followed the rules. Not hard to work out, if people don’t comply, the Government will take further action &amp; introduce more restrictions. I don’t like them either Adam, but as I’ve repeatedly said, it’s down to us all.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Liv_Lever I’m sick of covid and all the virtue signalling from Labour yes. Politics never used to be so intense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JadeWatches @Keir_Starmer Why would there be a child that hasn’t eaten for 3 days, when their parents get child tax credits and universal credit? It means the parents arnt spending the money on food. Which makes me think, why.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mummy_Central That’s not true. But let’s just say it is, so why arnt the parents feeding them then? Every parent gets child tax credits to pay for food. So no children should be hungry, they should be the priority. The Government also gives universal credit to the poorest, so there is support.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jenn7_4 @SwindonPete81 You said you’d disown yours if they had a different opinion to you, take a good look at yourself. Plus, nobody wants children to starve. There is Government support for the most vulnerable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>State on this👇🏼🤦🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mummy_Central As I said, help is available for the most vulnerable and those in poverty. Your ignorance, there is no help for unfortunately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just updated Twitter. Bit different looking. Think I’ve worked it all out...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zarahsultana The poorest children are supported. Child tax credits are also given to help pay for food. At the end of the day, the state is not responsible for funding all meals through the school holidays, that’s a parents role. If in desperate need, there is Government help available.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulPsmith67 @KrestenRasmusse @spacebar69 @DavidGHFrost @DomWalsh13 @MichelBarnier What’s your excuse? Just plain stupid or just rude in general?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lloydda02708611 @lisanandy Exactly. And we were in a deep recession in 2008-2010. I don’t recall Labour funding school meals in the holidays then...again, it’s all just virtue signalling and media stunts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@griffo65 @Iromg @GuidoFawkes @AngelaRayner Angela Rayner has blocked half the country. She doesn’t like anybody calling her out on anything. Welcome to the ‘blocked’ club 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ursuladarrigan @christmas__ape @PaulBrandITV They were. Even Andy Burnham has confirmed. Why lie? They were offered £22m for track n trace and £60m for biz support. Andy turned down the £60m. They are giving it anyway to local councils. So £82m in total!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vivjones10 @ChrisClarksonMP She can’t have anybody disagreeing with her or calling her lies out. Arrogance personified!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KrestenRasmusse @spacebar69 @DavidGHFrost @DomWalsh13 @MichelBarnier Because we are an independent country, the EU can’t dictate out fishing water, rules etc. Canada got a trade deal, this is spite firm the EU now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yikes. Think their student loan needed to be increased a tad 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kinzoid @spacebar69 @DavidGHFrost @DomWalsh13 @MichelBarnier Talks wouldn’t have restarted if they hadn’t moved on something...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine the media pressure on a Conservative to resign, had they referred to a Labour MP as ‘scum’ in the House of Commons. Yet nothing when Angela Rayner calls a Tory scum. Like the fact there was no media pressure for SNP MP Margaret Ferrier to resign. The media bias is toxic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spacebar69 @DavidGHFrost @DomWalsh13 @MichelBarnier It got the EU to move. Now it’s on them. If they still don’t budge, it will be off again. We had to call their bluff, they blinked. We will see how it goes. Boris will stand firm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best thing to do Londoners....vote for @ShaunBaileyUK next year. #London can’t afford any more of @SadiqKhan’s waste. Enough is enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The nasty lefties are out in force again, with a massive push to get #ToryScum trending. Sad &amp; pathetic. Ironically, the way they behave, it’s not really the Tories that are ‘scum’ is it. Take a look in the mirror! While Labour play politics, the @Conservatives get on with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think @ChrisClarksonMP was being very accurate in what he was saying. I also think that Angela Rayner was showing herself to be the nasty, spiteful &amp; vindictive person we know she is. I’ve called out out before &amp; for all lies she tells, hence I’m blocked, like half the country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamHarriss00 The Government is not responsible for every child, that’s is a parents job. There is help available if some families are struggling. People also get child tax credits to help pay for things like food. Stop trying to create a narrative that doesn’t exist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PippaCrerar Why don’t you put your Labour affiliation on your profile, I think it’s fair that everyone can see you don’t do journalism, just labour activism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This👇🏼Devolved Governments are making decisions that have major consequences on people’s lives, and yet they get next to no scrutiny. We all knew she’d extend her ‘short, sharp’ lockdown. Much like Wales will likely do with their national ‘firebreak’ lockdown. Enough is enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This👇🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@izcohar6 @silverstrivers Exactly. They just can’t help themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The media are completely biased. They lie and mislead the public, to push an anti Government, anti Boris, anti Brexit and anti British agenda.   #RETWEET if you agree. 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hannah_Spanner6 @richardintheuk @bbclaurak Delusional<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Media trying to mislead again. They may as well be wearing Labour rosettes. Government had offered the £60m on top of the £22m for T&amp;T. Burnham rejected it. Boris said it would be distributed to the constituencies/local levels instead. All Burnham achieved was delays. #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BethRigby This tweet actually makes me angry. The £60m (on top of the £22m) offered by Government was turned down by Burnham &amp; was in line with what Government gave places like Liverpool &amp; Lancashire. To say he fought for his people, when he was already offered that, is a LIE. #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BethRigby He was offered the £60m by Government and turned it down. So how has he won? Pure media bias, misleading the public yet again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcusRashford If you can’t afford to have more than two children, then don’t have any more. I fully support the 2-child UC cap. The benefits system before meant that some could take advantage of it, earning more than hard working families.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@splootman @AddictScrabble @BorisJohnson If people abide by the rules, a national lockdown won’t be needed. Problem is, there’s no so much division in the country, people are not following the rules. If rules arnt followed, the infection will spread. People who break those rules, will only have themselves to blame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boris is making Keir Starmer look like an absolute idiot. Labour attacking everything for the sheer sake of it. So weak &amp; flappy. Nobody wants this corrosive behaviour from Labour. It is not a good idea for a full national lockdown. @BorisJohnson is absolutely correct. #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Loving the fact @BorisJohnson is going straight in on @SadiqKhan, blaming him for bankrupting TfL 🔥 #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lockdown138 @christmas__ape @PaulBrandITV Burnham has himself admitted that. So get off your high horse you absolute melt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Weeto_boy @gwynne_steve @Fi3ld23 @EllMac8 @Suebeloo1971 @Keir_Starmer There is a financial model in place. Based on that, the business support for Manchester would have been £58m, they were offered £60m. Yet that was rejected. It is not just Manchester going into Tier 3, has to be fair. Burnham was playing politics to make Government look bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeaveEUOfficial Farage clearly missing the limelight. The Government doesn’t need this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Burnham also pretended to only find out about Manchester being put into Tier 3, whilst grandstanding on his press conference outside town hall. He was actually told 2hrs before by a Government minister. Labour play politics and still they manage to deceive people. Brexit again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So many people have been duped &amp; brainwashed by Labour’s Andy Burnham. How exactly has he protected the north? He delayed them going into Tier 3, risking lives. Hospital admissions are up. He also turned down £60m, of the total £82 million offered (22m T&amp;T, 60m biz support) #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JKCorden Except it was staged and sheer political grandstanding. People who don’t know the facts, shouldn’t get involved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BegbieTheCat @JHMmmm0 Well the funding model is based on population size. On that, both have been treated equally. Your original quote made out that £60m was total offered to Manchester, it wasn’t, £82m was offered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BegbieTheCat @JHMmmm0 Which is exactly why Manchester were offered £22m T&amp;T and £60m BS, for double the size of the population. Funding is based on population size. So it was always fair. Andy Burnham has been playing politics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaptainHaZ @christmas__ape @PaulBrandITV That is a lie. There are two separate pots. One for track and trace, which is the 22m. The other was being negotiated, which they were offered 60m. That is 82m in total offered. What are you not getting? It’s been made clear in the news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still people aren’t understanding the basic facts👇🏼. Andy Burnham &amp; Manchester were offered £82m.  £22m for track and trace, and £60m for business support. It is the £60m for biz support Andy turned down. In total, he was offered £82m. People need to understand the facts - #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BegbieTheCat They were offered £82m. £22m for track and trace, and £60m for business support. It is the 60m for biz support he turned down. In total, he was offered £82m. Would be good if you knew the facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Lev75_ @KayBurley @AndyBurnhamGM @RobertJenrick They were offered £82m. 22m fire track and trace, 60m for business support. Can you do maths?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christmas__ape @PaulBrandITV And Manchester were offered £82m. £22m for track and trace, £60m for business  support.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulBrandITV @RobertJenrick Andy Burnham just wanted the attention &amp; opportunity to play politics for political gain. A typical Labour politician. Same with Keir Starmer pushing for a national lockdown, which isn’t in the interest of the whole nation. Sick of Labour trying to exploit this crisis - #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not every Mayor is about virtue signalling &amp; political game-playing, like in Manchester. Andy Burnham was offered £22m for test &amp; trace, as well as £60m for business support. He turned down the £60m as he wanted to play political games with people’s businesses and lives. #PMQS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hoosiers1986 @realDonaldTrump 💯 Need to keep momentum going!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vivjones10 @JoeBiden Harris is smug, can’t stand her. The media out in America are awful, literally campaigning for Biden. Much like the British media campaign for Labour atm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vivjones10 @JoeBiden I hope so. It’s all starting to get more serious. Always some drama at election time with laptops or emails 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is America taking note of the #LaptopFromHell? Is it damaging Biden? Too many possibilities. #TeamTrump all the way! 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #waleslockdown is a damaging mistake. It’s sad to see so many in Wales completely blinded by @MarkDrakeford &amp; Labour. All Labour care about is power &amp; point scoring. They could even rename Christmas as Drakemas - as some think he’s the second coming. Completely duped. #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCNWT While Keir Starmer himself campaigns for a national lockdown, which would damage jobs, lives and livelihoods. Labour are so all over the place, it’s giving me whiplash.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@foxesdale But a minority don’t, then blame Boris for it all. Its making me quite angry now. Then we’re all punished with tougher restrictions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyBurnhamGM Keir Starmer wants a national lockdown &amp; you agreed with him on it. You’re just making all this up as you go along. Brainwashing people into thinking you’re supporting them, but more like your own career. You can’t say you want to keep business open, if you support Keir.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welsh Labour Government have got it massively wrong on the #waleslockdown aka ‘firebreak’. They kept Wales locked down much longer than England &amp; it got them nowhere. @MarkDrakeford is making a mess of the Welsh economy &amp; gets no scrutiny. Don’t vote for these muppets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LSadler16861851 Tell me about it, does my head in!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@francisobrienUK It’s definitely extra toxic tonight. It’s cos the left feel energised. The left are some of the nastiest, vile bunch of people we have in this country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politicalite @louisrossilevy Boris has apparently failed the north, because he’s trying to prevent cases going up and deaths sharply rising amongst the over 60s? What utter rubbish. What would we get from Labour? A national lockdown.  Quite sad how some of the young in this country have lost their heads.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lesleyarenshaw @PoliticsShmoli1 @paul__johnson It’s not true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sick of trying to explain this to stupid people. If you don’t know the facts, don’t spout rubbish on twitter until you do. ANY area the goes into Tier 3 gets £8 per head of population. That’s 22m for Manchester. That is SEPARATE to the negotiations on biz support (60m offer) 🤦🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bipolarvoice @Colin00007 @PippaCrerar They are two separate pots. The 22m was guaranteed. Any tier 3 gets £8 per head of population, meaning Manchester woudl always get 22m for tier 3. On top of that, negotiations were taking place for business support (the 60m offer). That hasn’t been agreed yet. What’s hard to get?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AddictScrabble @Suebeloo1971 @Keir_Starmer I dunno if anything has been agreed yet. The 22m was the basics for text and trace. The negotiations were for business support, that hasn’t been agreed yet. But some brain dead people are confusing the two and stating government has slashed the 60. 🤦🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Okeating @EllMac8 @BorisJohnson The 22m is a completely diff pot to the 60m. One is for test and trace, the other is for business support. The 22m was always going ahead, the negotiations were for businesses, which hasn’t been agreed yet. If you can’t understand basics, you shouldn’t be misleading on here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EllMac8 @Suebeloo1971 @Keir_Starmer They are separate, what are you struggling to grasp? They were always getting the 22m, as that was for enforcement and test &amp; trace. The negotiations were on the business support package, which was the 60m mentioned. It’s really not hard to understand. Maybe have a read on BBC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paul__johnson 22m is separate to the 60m offered. One is money for enforcement/test and trace, the other is business support. Get the facts right! 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lisanandy Manchester was offered 60m on top of 22m. It wasn’t turned down. Grow up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trymybest18 @TomSwarbrick1 The £22m mentioned by Mr Johnson - which is for expenses such as local enforcement and test and trace - is separate to the £60m business support package that has been mentioned, that hasn’t been agreed yet. Why you mixing them up?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomSwarbrick1 What’s toxic? It’s Andy Burnham playing political games. £22m mentioned is based on £8 per head population, same as all Tier 3  areas. This is for expenses such as local enforcement &amp; test and trace. It is separate to the £60m business support package not agreed yet. Misleading.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPJHodges @mjs121272 He won’t take it becuase he’s playing games.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The North of England isn’t just Manchester. Seems like some in Manchester think they rule the North. They don’t. Also, if some people in Greater Manchester hadn’t been constantly breaking the rules, they woudlnt be in Tier 3 now. All increases in covid is down to non compliance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthea_bailey Burnham is a disgrace. The £22m isn’t even the business support package, it’s the package for test and trace, which is based on £8 per head of population of a tier 3 area. Yet he’s twisted it to brainwash people. So many falling for his virtue  signalling and media charade 🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Suebeloo1971 @Keir_Starmer Are you stupid? They are two separate things. The 22m is based in £8 per head of the population. That is what ALL tier 3 areas get. The other around is the business support package, which they haven’t agreed upon yet. Get your fact ma correct before spouting trash on twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dinosofos Thing is, this 22m is what all tier 3 areas get. It’s based on £8 per head of population. It’s completely different to any support business package. A Labour political stunt by Burnham has literally brainwashed so many.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexhrbfc By having a picture with a business woman? Oh yes, criminal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The lefties absolutely wetting themselves with excitement today over ‘#KingOfTheNorth’. Pure politics. While Andy Burnham &amp; Labour continue their constant virtue signalling &amp; media charade, Boris continues to try balancing saving lives with saving the economy. A tough balance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Realist_187 @AndyBurnhamGM He’s the one that’s prevented a deal. A lot of deluded people on twitter tonight. Andy was playing politics stating he wants to keep businesses open, while at the same time agreeing with Keir Starmer on a national lockdown. Can’t make it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR @BorisJohnson Boris knows this and doesn’t want a national lockdown, unlike Labour. Better hope the country starts abiding by the rules though Adam. Maybe a few tweets in support of driving down cases wouldn’t go a miss 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LukeDyks The way Andy has gone about it was wrong. He could have been more like the Liverpool Mayor. Instead, he gave businesses uncertainty and cases/hospital admissions rise drastically over the period. I don’t think it’s wrong for Government to want to work with local leaders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewRTDavies @djdave1926 @WelshGovernment Let’s be serious @AndrewRTDavies, when do Labour ever listen? They are hell bent on doing what they want, regardless of what is best for the people of Wales.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree, compliance is critical. If people continue to flout the rules, have house parties, gatherings etc, cases and deaths will continue to rise. Then what? A national lockdown none of us want, which has massive consequences on jobs, businesses &amp; mental health. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour’s Andy Burnham has been playing politics for days now &amp; it will have cost lives. Boris is right to impose restrictions on Manchester. Labour can’t say on the one hand they won’t accept businesses closing, then on the other, push for a national lockdown. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Greater Manchester not looking great at all for cases or hospital admissions. @AndyBurnhamGM has wasted days and days arguing with the Government about putting Manchester into a regional lockdown. Labour play politics. That’s all. Disgusting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears It would only last 6 months if people like you keep attending house parties and cases continue to go up. Then everyone goes home and spreads it to older family at Xmas. I cancelled my house party to get cases down. It’s nobody’s fault but the rules breakers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears 6 months?! It’s 28 days. Reviews take place every month for Tier 3. If everyone abided by the rules, woudnt be in it long. You can’t talk when you attend parties that spread it. You’re also now supporting Labour of a full national lockdown. They’ve done a hatchet job on you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears You didn’t answer my question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfKarolSikora @CarolPoyerPeett Circuit breaker = Labour policy.  Fire break = Labour policy.  Labour just want national lockdown. But they also pretend they don’t want to close the economy re. Manchester.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears If he cares about the economy as you say, why has he said he’d like a circuit break national lockdown?!?!?!?!?!?! The two are opposites.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears So what’s the point of negotiating a finance  deal for Tier 3, if he wants Government to do a national circuit break lockdown? He’s playing two games. Official Labour policy is a national lockdown. He’s just doing it for political gain, knowing it’s pointless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears He still wants a national lockdown though. Do you support that? If not, you don’t support Burnham 💯. He’s saying he doesn’t want closures in Manchester on one hand, then on the other he says he wants the whole country closed down. in a circuit break lockdown. He’s fooled you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears Burnham wants a national lockdown! You support a national lockdown now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only failure is local leaders like Burnham, deliberately playing politics to undermine &amp; make the Government look bad. Considering Labour want a national lockdown, it’s odd why Labour couldn’t support local measures in Manchester.  Labour only interested in getting to power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichelBarnier @DavidGHFrost Shove it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blah blah blah. They just don’t want to be seen as the bad guys. They are. There is no point having talks if the EU won’t move on their ridiculous stance on making sure Britain isn’t a true independent country. The EU can shove it where the sun don’t shine. 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyBurnhamGM Yet you are happy for a national lockdown, which would mean even more closures. This is political game playing and you know it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer Labour are a farce. Saying different things each and every day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is ludicrous. Labour have spent the last week refusing to let the Government put Greater Manchester in a regional lockdown, yet demand a national one. Best to focus major restrictions on areas with higher cases, not punish areas with low cases. Labour are off their nut.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour playing politics again, trying to undermine the Government for political gain. Labour refusing to accept Tier 3 restrictions in Greater Manchester, which has a higher level of covid cases &amp; rising hospital admissions, but yet demanding a minimum 3 week NATIONAL lockdown 🤷🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPJHodges It was his idea. He also wanted Tier 2 and wants a national lockdown. The man is a joke. Labour need to be voted out of London.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good move👇🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Scotland aren’t following the ridiculous Labour Welsh Government lockdown farce 👇🏼 Good call.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChristieC733 🤞🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is it with the media lying and misleading all the time. @Peston just said on ITV news that we were heading for a deep recession. Yet Q3 GDP growth is forecast to be a record, around 16% up. Official estimate out next month. That is not a recession!!!! 😤<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Maybe then, people might actually see the damage that Labour do in Wales and vote them out next year. By the UK Government giving Mark Drakeford money all the time, the Welsh people don’t see the damage, as Labour take all the credit for the handouts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So that means....talks will not continue. The end. Move on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR How does the Government crack down on transmissions in homes? It can’t. It’s all about communications. I see many attacking Government for certain restrictions, but if those people had helped push a message to follow the rules 6 weeks ago, we wouldn’t have more restrictions now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR This proves my point, cases are being driven by non compliance of the rules. Selfish people deliberately rule breaking by having gatherings &amp; house parties. Government can’t do anything about what people do in homes, hence why it comes for pubs. Start pushing on rule compliance.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is the problem with Labour, it’s not about what is best for Wales or the UK, it’s about trying to exploit the crisis for political gain.  A national lockdown is not the answer. Calling it a #firebreak in Wales, doesn’t detract from the fact it’s a ludicrous #waleslockdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atticrahman As in moving around from different areas yes. But now everything non essential must close. Back to March 23rd in Labour’s #firebreak national lockdown. Awful decision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This #waleslockdown by Labour will be disastrous for Wales. A full national lockdown is not the answer, it locks down places with hardly any cases. You can guarantee many businesses will close, many jobs will be lost and it will have a severe impact on mental health. #firebreak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mark Drakeford making a mess of #Wales yet again. Punishing the whole of Welsh towns, cities and villages.    RETWEET below👇🏼  #waleslockdown #firebreak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welsh Labour Government is a joke. Destroying Wales. #circuitbreaker   Retweet if you’d like the Welsh Government abolished. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulBrandITV The only joke in Wales, is the Labour Government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The way things are going, I don’t think Labour Mayor @AndyBurnhamGM is going to be seen in a good light in Manchester. Beds filling up, cases high, MP Yasmin Qureshi with covid admitted to hospital. At least he got some airtime &amp; was able to play politics for political gain tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If true, then it will be down to a couple of reasons. Some people continuously breaking the rules in Manchester and @AndyBurnhamGM playing politics, who is trying to blackmail the Government. Labour position is all over the place, which undermines the Government health messsge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kirstiealley wonder who you would have voted in the UK 🇬🇧 elections....hopefully Boris!! Glad you’re voting Trump in 🇺🇸 elections too. Never let anybody silence you, always stick to your guns!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems @AndyBurnhamGM is just trying to blackmail the Government. At the same time hospital beds in Manchester fill up. Not a good look. Government is doing everything it can to keep the economy open (unlike Labour who want a national lockdown), but it also has to protect lives.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AlistairHaimes I believe it is quite high, cos a lot are breaking the rules having indoor house parties. Too many selfish rule breakers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnneTow84880951 I’ve seen many complaining it’s stealing their youth and nobody has has had their youth stolen before, which would be completely untrue considering how many lost theirs at war.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching this film, based in World War 1, it does make you think some in this country are proper spoilt brats. In a few weeks we remember those who died in the war fighting for the UK, some v young. Yet some are moaning about the rule of six &amp; 10pm curfew, designed to save lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anybody watched 1917? About to watch it..... #filmnight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So some counties have locked down completely, most countries have curfews now, including a 9pm one in France. Sweden is introducing restrictions themselves &amp; now Italy with its own rule of six. So we arn’t some stand out country introducing rules that nobody else is, as some say.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears Those civil liberties of not attending parties you mean? 😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kingofkennyhill @AdamJackman3 @leeg1972 @EssexPR But then everything will be closed. I may not understand or agree with certain rules myself, but I can see the more they are broken the tougher the restrictions get. I guess anybody that breaks them, can’t complain when they go up a tier, or we going into a national lockdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR @lucylou582 Agree on that yes, there are far too many deaths from other non covid and my belief is that lockdowns can make that even worse. My point to Lucy was that deaths have started to go back up again since the peak, so her point that it is simply ‘gone’ isn’t true is it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought they were all immune now though? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BethRigby Maybe the indoor parties aren’t such a good idea then...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucylou582 @EssexPR That doesn’t explain deaths going up again though does it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR In an unprecedented pandemic. Nothing they do is known to work &amp; nothing will be universally liked. Some want tougher restrictions, some want none. Point is, the more rule breaking, the tougher the restrictions. Unless you want to be closed, you should want people to follow rules<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IsleOfSceptre @Bob261048 3rd Nov I believe...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leeg1972 @EssexPR Well those same rule breakers will end up closing down all pubs. It’s not rocket science what will happen. If everyone broke the rules, had mass parties &amp; gatherings, cases would go up, as would hospital admissions. We all know the Government would then put everyone into lockdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR You might not agree with certain restrictions the Government have introduced Adam, but you can’t blame the Government for people’s bad behaviour and blatant rule breaking. The reason cases and indeed hospital admissions have gone up, is down to certain people breaking the rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@N9THX Same. Loved then! Hate that Harris too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, if it takes 2-3 weeks to even start seeing the results of a lockdown, there is no way that it’ll just end there. Labour’s idea to keep going into a national lockdown is dangerous. Feel sorry for Wales being run by the serial incompetent Labour Party &amp; @MarkDrakeford. #Marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BREAKING ⚠️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are we really surprised? Labour say different things to different people to get their vote. Everything they do is for political gain, not in the interest of the people.  It is only the @Conservatives and @BorisJohnson that are trying to protect both lives &amp; the economy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@barbaramurphy8 Don’t blame you 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh I do love a bit of Michael Gove on a #SundayMorning. He certainly gets under the skin of the lefties in this country. Keep it up @michaelgove. #Ridge #Marr 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PippaCrerar And a national lockdown (with no guaranteed end date), which Labour are calling for, including Andy Burnham, is a sure fire way to protect jobs and businesses right? 🙄 I think not.  The @Conservatives Government are trying to balance protecting lives &amp; the economy. #Marr #Ridge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you Gove. Labour want to destroy the country &amp; economy, just to try and gain some political points, but it is not in the national interest. Some areas have such low cases, it would do unnecessary damage. The Government is trying to protect lives &amp; the economy. #Ridge #Marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gove is right, Labour &amp; Andy Burnham are playing political games. The Government is doing everything it can to protect lives &amp; stop deaths from spiralling, whilst keeping the majority of the economy open &amp; jobs protected. Damned if they do &amp; damned if they don’t. #Ridge #Marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour have admitted they can’t guarantee Keir Starmer's circuit breaker national lockdown would only last 2-3 weeks. Shad education sec Kate Green said: 'No-one can guarantee what will happen'. There you have it folks, Labour just exploiting the crisis for political gain. #Ridge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look who’s talking, it’s Kirstie Alley. Good on her for not being afraid to say it like it is. Think you should definitely do an interview on your podcast with the man himself, @realDonaldTrump. UK will be thrilled! #TeamTrump #MAGA #Marr #Ridge #SundayThoughts 🇬🇧 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think all my American 🇺🇸 followers should definitely be voting for @realDonaldTrump. He is giving his heart &amp; soul to the American people, his passion is off the scale. He’d also be far better for the UK than Biden. Wouldn’t trust Biden in the slightest. #Trump2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So Labour’s @MarkDrakeford has banned me from entering #Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 to go see my mum, as I live in #London, which is a Tier 2 hotspot. Problem with that is, I live in the area of #Sutton, where we have less cases per 100k than pretty much every single area of Wales. It’s ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This whole devolved Government in Wales &amp; Scotland is corrupt. It’s a complete failure &amp; spreads misinformation. If something is done that people don’t like, it’s Boris &amp; Tories fault. If it’s something good, Labour &amp; SNP take credit, despite the fact it’s UK funded 🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulcblade @HHepplewhite End up in full lockdown, so it isn’t helping anybody really.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MENnewsdesk Yet he calls for a national lockdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But Keir Starmer wants the whole country in a national lockdown and therefore all pubs, restaurants, bars etc closed. The two don’t mix. You can’t on the one hand say you support Andy Burnham for not wanting things closed, but then call for the closure of everything nationwide 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesMelville 8.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexhrbfc @darrengrimes_ Cummings didn’t put anybody at risk. He stuck to all social distancing rules etc. So no rise in covid was down to him. What this got to do with him? 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kally3107 Agree, hence why the south is starting to get worse and hit tier 2 levels etc. It’s frustrating as it can all be prevented.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>VAR saves the day 😂 #EVELIV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely useless Everton!! 😫#EVELIV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Seany1969 Agree, impossible for the Government atm. They’ll always piss off somebody. They just have to balance it as best they can. Hence why I think what they’re doing is the best way, keep things open, but have rules tighter in hotspots. If everyone follows the rules, it’ll get better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tommylions56 And where’s that gunna get us? In a national lockdown with everything closed. Oh, such a result!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Seany1969 Well if we follow them, then everything stays open, that’s surely better than breaking them and then everything is closed. No?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HHepplewhite We’ll be in tier 3 at this rate. I despair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EwMc1969 So why do Labour want a national lockdown for 3 weeks? It’s all game playing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Londoners need to vote for this man next year👇🏼  The @SadiqKhan failed years need to be brought to an end #London.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madcow42 @perryman54 When did I tar everyone with the same brush in my tweet?! I said it is ‘down to the people in those areas who HAVEN’T been following the rules’. Therefore not blaming the ones who have followed the rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you’re siding with the EU and their arrogant, threatening bureaucrats, rather than supporting Britain and the British PM, who is standing up for us, are you even British? 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wbacurtis Same. She’s so overhyped<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WelshNish People could have stuck to the rules and avoided any kind of lockdown. It’s now in everyone’s hands to avoid any national lockdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darrengrimes_ Hardly fair. Bit hard to level up in the hospitality area right now, when we have so many restrictions forced on us, because so many selfish people wouldn’t abide by the rules over the last 6 weeks.  It’s not a north south side thing. It’s covid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How do I pick out of these two incompetent numpties!!?! 🤯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hoddy67 @HHepplewhite I agree. The majority are. But it only takes a minority for it to spread rapidly. Eventually it then spreads from young to old and that is why hospital admissions are now going up. It’s the selfish rule breakers that are to blame for all this. We could have avoided all this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wealdengirl I don’t support full lockdowns. My point is well over a month ago, the country was warned that unless everyone followed the rules, tougher measures woudl come. Some people didn’t follow the rules. Houseparties, street parties etc. It is those who have caused this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sxmmieftw I didn’t blame the north. I blamed the people who haven’t followed the rules. Keep up. The same goes for London being in tier 2, it’s becuase some didn’t follow the rules and have been having parties and mass gatherings. Do read properly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet Labour Mayor Andy Burnham is still playing political games in Manchester. No Government wants to impose restrictions, but we can still avoid a national lockdown, as Boris has said. All these tougher restrictions are cos some didn’t follow the rules. We were warned weeks ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why doesn’t this surprise me eh 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Devastating that Liverpool &amp; Lancashire &amp; soon to be Manchester have had to be locked down. Sadly, it’s not surprising &amp; is down to the people in those areas who haven’t been following the rules. We’ve all seen the videos of rule breaking. People were warned of the consequences.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Hoosiers1986 Yes we do!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremy_hume @SadiqKhan Boris has nothing to gain by killing the economy and doing unpopular decisions. Grow up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you for real @SadiqKhan? Everything you say is to attack Government, with no substance. You have campaigned continuously to kill London’s economy &amp; now you’re pretending to care about the thousands who might lose their job. You want a national lockdown ffs, you hypocrite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Americanpride94 @Sicilian1926 Who’s supporting Trump then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexIden2 Yea, it’s frustrating. Especially loving in the south. But if everybody followed the simple 6 people rule, cases would not have gone up so rapidly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well #London, we’re sadly now officially in Tier 2. If ALL Londoners stick to the rules, we push down cases &amp; hospital admissions, maybe we can go back to Tier 1 next month. Let’s not mess this up. We were warned of the consequences last time. Same goes to the rest of the UK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The media are obsessed with trying to smear and bring down Boris. Very sad. Why is this even news?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tommynielsen2 😂 done!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ElRaynerista The deal Boris negotiated last year was the Withdrawal Agreement. He never had an oven ready trade deal, as that was to be negotiated this year. Seems like it’s not really #BorisTheLiar, but YOU are the liar. I stand with Boris. 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Downing Street have confirmed the Brexit talks are over. Trade deal cannot be reached with the EU at this point.   UK Government are now officially preparing for WTO Brexit. Boris stands firm. 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TzarTooFarr @BorisJohnson We have broke no laws currently. What law have we broken?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So proud of @BorisJohnson today. Proved a lot of people wrong. Never lost faith - A PM that stands up for Britain against the EU, who have not negotiated in good faith. Well done Boris 🇬🇧 👏🏼👊🏼 🇬🇧 No Deal it is then... Australia style. #BrexitReality<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ricky_K67 PM spokesperson has just stated that unless the EU change position immediately, no point Barnier coming to London next week. Boris isn’t budging on his position. Finally a PM standing up for Britain on brexit. Well done Boris!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@moosh07 @BBCPolitics Because they are OUR waters, not the EUs. Are you even British? If so, act it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Leon_SFrench And what is the Canada style agreement then? That works for the EU, but they simply won’t do a deal like that for us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@moosh07 @BBCPolitics They aren’t moving their position on fisheries etc, so it’s pointless to continue if they do not change their approach.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCPolitics To anybody saying this is a bad outcome. It is the EU who have not negotiated in good faith and they are inflexible in doing a trade deal that recognises the UK has an independent country. Well done @BorisJohnson 👏🏼 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s quite comical watching all the remainers who tried to stop #Brexit from ever happening, having a meltdown on Twitter.   @BorisJohnson stuck to his word. We left the EU in January and we will leave the transition period 31 Dec, with or without a trade deal. 🇬🇧 #NoDealBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AntonySCardiff @SkyNews @BorisJohnson Most of us wanted a deal, but the EU weren’t flexible. No trade deal is better than a bad trade deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NuncTempus @SkyNews It’s the one they needed to change slightly, as the EU decided to make threats and start interpreting the n.Ireland protocol different.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m impressed with Boris. He’s stayed true to his word. The EU have been appalling in how they have treated the UK throughout both the WA agreement negotiations and this year for the trade deal negotiations. Threats &amp; an unwillingness to be flexible. No deal it is then! 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NuncTempus @SkyNews That was the WA, this is the trade deal, keep up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Yes @BorisJohnson, we are with you! 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stay firm @BorisJohnson. We are right behind you against the threatening and quite frankly, appalling behaviour of the EU in these negotiations. I personally want a deal, but based on how they are acting, I’m happy to go full steam ahead with no deal. #Brexit 🇬🇧 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When you have to wear a mask to the toilet in a pub....but you know #Brexit is coming fast..... 🇬🇧  https://t.co/VrWmPbhwQx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guess what?! Yup you guessed it, @SadiqKhan has run out of money again for TfL. He ran out of money before covid, during covid, still during covid, but at least he has some extra press officers ay. Londoners will pay the price of a #Labour Mayor. Don’t vote for him next year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AJ_1066 How is it fair to do a blanket London tier 2 on that though 🤷🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always knew the south was better than the north 😂  https://t.co/3VNndEgq8Z<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbclaurak More like, it’s cos Manchester has a high amount of covid 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour Mayor Andy Burnham is refusing to let Manchester go into Tier 3, even though it has one of the highest amount of covid cases in the UK, yet the Labour Leader Keir Starmer wants the whole country closed down completely &amp; every pub, bar, gym, restaurant, and salon closed 🤦🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Liverpool Mayor went up slightly in my estimations yesterday, by working with the Government to put a plan together &amp; secondly, for calling out the reckless behaviour of some selfish people breaking rules. @AndyBurnhamGM, has plummeted. Playing politics, like the rest of Labour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolute joke that Margaret Ferrier will face no action. They may have made it the law after she was tested, but she still broke clear guidelines. As an MP, she should set an example &amp; not only did she not do that, she put lives at risk by visiting places &amp; travelling with covid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dollmay10 I wonder. Labour probs won’t bother opening up again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Labour Welsh Government likely going ahead with 2-3 week full lockdown in Wales, with economy closed inc gyms, pubs, restaurants etc shutting. Kinda makes you think, what was the point in all the lockdowns in each council area, didn’t do much then did it. Utter bonkers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has to be no deal then. They’re demanding fishing access to our waters without compromise, yet it’s our territory as an independent state. This has gone far enough now. If this is how they want to play it, end negotiations. It’ll be tough with no deal, but we can make it work 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcusRashford Well the tax payers can’t constantly fund it, if the parents can’t feed their kids in the school holidays, I’m sure you can dip into those deep footballers pockets of yours and pay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@montie Imagine Labour though! They’d have us in permanent national lockdown.  https://t.co/sRcfQZVDGO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@titch37322943 Never too early these day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If for some crazy reason America didn’t vote to keep @realDonaldTrump as 🇺🇸 president, can Londoners have him to take over from @SadiqKhan please. That would shake it up a bit in #London 😂   #ThursdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoHolz If you’re a Trump supporter, get in!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He needs to go, on so many levels. He has failed at everything he’s done (or not done) in #London. Blames central Government for all his failures, then goes begging for billions in bailouts from Boris. Problem is, most Londoners would vote for 💩 if it had a Labour rosette on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve said it before &amp; I’ll say it again. @SadiqKhan has to be voted out next year as Labour mayor. He doesn’t do his job &amp; has failed in all his duties as mayor of #London. From rising knife crime, to cross-rail delays, to TfL bailouts, to not calling out vandalism by protesters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well said @Jacob_Rees_Mogg! 🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If EVERYONE had followed the rules like the majority of us, that would have prevented further restrictions.  We would not now be going into Tier 2 or full local lockdowns if the rules hadn’t been broken by a few selfish people. This is down to the rule breakers, not Government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyhewertson No, certain young people are ruining it for themselves &amp; others, by not following the rules. Over a month ago the Government warned of the consequences of not following the rules. Some ignored it, had house parties, mass gatherings in the streets etc. That is why!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@democracywins12 @tomhfh He said today was deadline if no movement<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarenJukes2 It was always about limiting risk. The lower the people, the lower the risk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As said below, people that don’t follow the rules have caused all these local lockdowns. Majority in #London have followed the guidelines, but due to some, selfishly breaking the rules, we are all punished by entering Tier 2 with a #londonlockdown, even in places with low cases.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rjlowe87 @SadiqKhan True. He hasn’t done anything right to be honest has he. He’s inept at doing his job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get stuffed. You’ve failed in your job as Labour Mayor for years, and on many different levels. Couldn’t manage a piss up in a brewery, probably because you bankrupted them and closed it down. That’s if they survived all the knife crime you never fixed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sutton has less than 40 cases per 100k, but due to selfish fuc*ers across the rest of London breaking rules, @SadiqKhan has clumped me in an overall London Tier 2 &amp; banned me from seeing anybody outside my house. @fmwales has also banned me from entering Wales, where I’m from 🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BatchelorLtd @SadiqKhan If you broke the rules yes, but people shouldn’t. They clearly don’t believe ppl will stick to them, so have done the whole of London. My area has generally stuck to the rules, hence v low cases, yet now punished because other areas have broke the rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I live in #Sutton. It has less than 40 cases per 100k, by far the lowest in the whole of London. Yet it’s clumped in with the rest of London. London is far too big in my opinion to all be classed the same. I hate ⁦@SadiqKhan⁩ for pushing on this.   https://t.co/pwSbzcFYHD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Says it all about what Labour are all about👇🏼Purely exploiting the crisis again for political gain. Everything they say has no meaning, it’s just a way to attack the @Conservatives, who are doing their very best to protect lives, both from covid, but also from the economic shock.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UKLabour This is so crass and shows exactly why Labour don’t do grown up politics.The furlough scheme, which is still running has been unprecedented. As well as business bounce back loans and grants. He’s always been honest and said, he can’t save every job because it’s a global pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrHarryCole Sutton, which is in a London has around 30 cases per 100k. It would be unfair to treat London as one whole in my opinion, it’s too big. Maybe north or south is better way of doing it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeBates04 😂 I’m quite opinionated, so expect strong tweets from myself Haha! Probably a bit too many 😅 Will do. I have some awesome followers, but always welcome more! I currently have a bet on with my mate to get to 5k followers by Friday, so welcome any shoutout from you! 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeBates04 Hey!! 👋🏼 Fellow proud Brit too! 🇬🇧 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dominiquetaegon I massively disagree. But you know a lot will, and that is why you say it. I find a lot of your tweets these days are purely controversial, designed to get attention and to build a platform to further your own career/agenda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dalc_2908 Oh you’ll love me mate 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Favourite spirit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyBurnhamGM Labour Keir Starmer wants a full national lockdown, so what exactly do you support? Nothing. Labour are a mess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Soooooo close to 4k followers!!!!  Anybody want to get me over the line? 😬 It has taken 11 years....need that little nudge 😅  Would massively appreciate any retweets and new followers 🇬🇧 🇬🇧   #HAPPYHUMPDAY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hendopolis Slightly obsessed with Dom ain’t you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears The alternative is Labour and a full lockdown. It’s that simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Speaking to some people on here, it seems as if people have lost the plot. I swear some people would vote for a turd, as long as it had a Labour rosette on it 🤦🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s that 52/48 split again 🤷🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulBrandITV @YouGov I bet half of those asked don’t know what a circuit breaker entails. A circuit breaker is a national lockdown. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BornLondoner Most important dates. 31 January. We left as planned, once the Tories had a majority. The next date 31 December, we leave the transition period. All the rest is noise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So basically pointless then. After 2 weeks it would start up again &amp; we’d have to do it all over again.  The best strategy is what the @Conservatives Government and @BorisJohnson have announced. A regional approach, whereby we follow the rules and keep the economy open. Simples.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HHepplewhite @HopkinsBRFC Not like that no. Tho I do like a big open mushroom with garlic and melted cheese stuffed in it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politicalite Right wing vote split 3 ways, Labour win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scandalous! @SadiqKhan wanted a 10pm curfew, then he changed his mind &amp; said it was bad for business in London. Now he wants to lock down London for 3 weeks, even though some areas are very low in cases. Same as @Keir_Starmer, all over the place. No leadership. Labour are a joke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BoerboelUK @BorisJohnson Depends if their close to an agreement. If there was no movement, then yes, negotiation ends. Boris said if there was no movement by mid October, then there would be not point continuing. Suggests movement...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Garyscott62 @Bonitapip @theSNP @NicolaSturgeon If that were the case and I really wish it was, why do so many support and vote for Sturgeon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Selfish people who are consistently breaking the basic rules and spreading the virus, are actually prolonging the restrictions they constantly moan about. They are making a national lockdown more likely, that the Labour Party so desperately want. I’m with @BorisJohnson. #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HHepplewhite @theobald_2000 @BorisJohnson We should, but some aren’t as they don’t think they need to. Somebody I know said the other day to me they wouldn’t abide my the tier 2 rules if implemented, as many others are breaking the rules. If enough have that selfish attitude, we will all be forced into national lockdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeremyVineOn5 I support what he says, but the Tories have already stated about new laws coming in to prevent Labour Councils tearing down statues etc. All this party would do is take votes of the Tories and let Labour in. Labour would then wipe out our history and culture in full power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same old Labour Party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would love to see how exactly Scotland would fund itself, considering it relies heavily on England. It spends more money than it takes in taxes, meaning Scotland would suffer outside the UK. And what for? To give @theSNP and @NicolaSturgeon some extra power? Wake up Scotland.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidTooze2 It’s either a regional approach or a national one. Boris wants a regional and Labour wants a national lockdown. I know what I’d prefer of the two.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree re. the circuit breaker👇🏼 It’s Labour using the crisis as a opportunistic stunt to now push for a 2-3 week national lockdown.  I am of the view though that there will always remain the risk of a national lockdown, if we don’t support Boris by following the rules #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any regional lockdowns in this country, is very much down to this kind of behaviour. It doesn’t have to be like this. The Government is doing all it can to drive down cases and prevent deaths spiralling, whilst trying to protect the economy and keep it open #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abigail60173265 I agree. A full national lockdown is ridiculous, as it closes down areas where there are hardly any cases. A regional approach is clearly better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m so pleased to see @BorisJohnson is completely against a national lockdown, unlike the Labour Party. It is up to us all now to support him and help drive down cases. Let’s prevent any national lockdown &amp; keep the economy open, jobs going and businesses flourishing. #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boris is nailing #PMQs today. A clear strategy to get cases down &amp; protect the economy, if we all support it &amp; follow the rules. Starmer continuing to exploit this crisis, wanting to close down our economy &amp; country, putting people’s jobs, businesses &amp; mental health at risk #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Keir Starmer isn’t listening. He’s just determined to push for a national lockdown, even though that will close businesses across the UK, even where cases are low. Opportunistic game playing. Labour &amp; Starmer are shameful. Boris against a national lockdown, which is right. #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Josh_Macc I think people kinda did lose part of their youth in the war. People went to fight in wars at the age of like 18. Hardly enjoying themselves fighting for this country in trenches n all that, but they did it fighting for the people of the U.K. God help the youth now in a war!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paul66153553 I don’t!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Yeeeees Trump!!! Such energy and enthusiasm, a far cry from what we see from sleepy Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Michael_H85 @Nigel_Farage @JohnJMcGivern I want to keep going out, hence why I don’t want pubs bars etc closed. Thats the point. If people don’t follow some simple, limited rules, then we’ll all be housebound. Open you eyes. This ‘I’m not following the rules’ business will result in the very worst result, lockdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darogade @Nigel_Farage @JohnJMcGivern Guess where these young also go? To see parents, to see grandparents. And at Christmas? It’s not as simple as keeping all young separate to anybody over 60. It won’t happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage @JohnJMcGivern This is exactly why we might all end up in a lockdown, with businesses forced to close. I’m all up for parties, but I’d rather not right now and keep the pubs and bars open. Absolute idiots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Less than 300 followers off 4k....thanks all! 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears What you done now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jakimclaren @theSNP @Indyref Somebody started drinking early.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour love a bit of spin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR Imagine if Labour were in, the pubs across the whole country would be shut indefinitely. Let’s all do our bit, and stop any more pubs from being shut.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DesmondSwayne And yet Labour’s Captain Hindsight Starmer wants a national lockdown 🤷🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gunna have a big gym session tonight, thrash out all my frustrations from life and politics 😂👊🏼💪🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tnewtondunn Any restrictions are better than a national lockdown. People need to wake up to that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you want another national lockdown, as Captain Hindsight Keir Starmer is now calling for? #circuitbreaker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkStanding3 @ekusimo1 National debt will always increase until the deficit is gone. Unfortunately Labour left a huge deficit. Tories cut it by 4/5, but unfortunately the pandemic hit. Employment was also at a record higher under this Conservatives Government, until covid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taracartergmc Can’t make it up can you. Keir Starmer is just playing opportunistic and political games. He doesn’t care about what is best, just what he thinks will make him more popular from one day to the next.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CllrAlanRhodes Somebody started drinking early.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nikpet1 That’s why EVERY Labour Government has always left office with higher unemployment than when they went in then. Hardly done much cleaning up, more like made more of a mess. Get your facts right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour have always been the party of unemployment. We can see that if Keir Starmer was in power now, the economy would be shut down indefinitely, cities &amp; towns deserted, businesses boarded up and we’d all be locked up in our houses, living off unemployment benefits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t listen to Kier Starmer opportunistic calls for a #circuitbreaker, just follow the rules from Boris &amp; we can beat this. He wants a full national lockdown, that would cancel NHS operations, destroy more businesses, cause more unemployment. That should be a very last resort.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kier Starmer Press Conference: Opportunistic and ill thought out. It would send the country into another national lockdown, that would do so much damage. If everyone sticks to the rules, we can beat this without a full lockdown, that would damage jobs, business &amp; mental health.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Keir Starmer wants the country in a national lockdown for another 3 weeks. That damages the economy, causes more job losses and effects people’s mental health. Let alone cancelling more NHS operations. The Government is doing what it can to save lives and protect the economy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour &amp; Starmer are not wasting time in exploiting this pandemic for political gain. Consistent flip flopping, supporting, not supporting, then abstaining, all while confusing the public health message from Government. Shameful opportunism from @Keir_Starmer. Not leadership.  https://t.co/loEkpPNuW4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@silversynergy You could not stop education for another few months. Kids would have lost a years education. That wasn’t practical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peston @PaulBrandITV It’s an unprecedented pandemic, and a very tight balancing act.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPJHodges So they don’t want to say either way, and therefore, sit on the fence. That’s not leadership.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UKLabour You’d have us locked down forever, with job losses much much higher. Pathetic that all you can do is attack<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AJ_1066 Tut tut!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate liars &amp; people who twist the facts to suit their agenda 👇🏼 Whatever you think of him, he stressed it was not a prediction, only a possibility *if no further action was taken*. Action was taken. He also admitted the rule of six hadn’t had time to have an impact, it has now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TiceRichard He said they could potentially increase at that rate IF no restrictions were in place. Hence, they put restrictions in place. There are loads of restrictions, inc the rule of six. Therefore, that is why it hasn’t gone on that potential projection! I really do hate liars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I do love a bit of Trump!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Glad to see you’re supporting @realDonaldTrump then, Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Absolute joker!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremy_hume @Pippov66 @dolphhamer @Oneofthesilent1 This is rubbish. For example, when did Robert Jenrick break lockdown rules? He took food to his elderly parents, which you could do. At least get all your facts correct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Erm. Ok. But that is utter bull.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Any more and we’d be closing everything down. It’s about balance ffs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wheatfrom @MarnieRiptide @Conservatives The police issued a statement on Cummings, not heard anything on this, which is blatant rule breaking while travelling with covid. Regardless of how she goes, media should be putting more pressure, as well as all parties. She has no self respect. She should resign<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel like a broken record, but why is Margaret Ferrier still an MP? Where is this police investigation? If she was a @Conservatives MP there would be uproar, protests &amp; the press going wild. As well as constant Labour &amp; SNP attacks. It’s like it never happened... I despair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPJHodges It has to work, otherwise it’s full lockdown, everything shut. People need to make it work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seventiesicon @LindaBEdger That’ll explain the huge 20% drop in GDP then,such a small amount for such a nothing industry. Clearly doesn’t matter 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LozzaFox You can’t shield everyone over 60. It’s impossible. You will then have the young, mixing with the old and a lot of deaths. Anybody over 60 can get seriously ill. You talk sense on some things, this isn’t one of those occasions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Monty_London It’s not great no, but if we follow the rules, we avoid any other businesses being shut. Boris is nowhere near Corbyn levels, you been on the drink? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chesh18 It’s moving to the elderly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrHarryCole So basically, the country wants a full national lockdown. I despair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least Wetherspoons all over the country remain open. Silver lining n all that, in these torrid times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Oneofthesilent1 I think it’s more to how much people are abiding by the rules, tho London has started increasing lately, and people haven’t all been following the rules here. I think the key to defeating this is to follow the basics, keep the economy open, and drive down cases.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seventiesicon @LindaBEdger The UK economy is very much a service led economy, so these areas are vital. Not just to the economy, but to people’s mental health and social interaction. I support Boris in trying to keep these vital areas open.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PookMookie @barbaracantalk Not even Jesus can help you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s worrying that some people in Wales, always see Boris as the bad guy, even though decisions on lockdowns &amp; restrictions in Wales are made by the Welsh Labour Government. That also praise Labour for grants, furlough &amp; economic help, when that is the Conservative Government 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Government is doing everything it can to drive down cases &amp; to stop hospital admissions &amp; deaths spiralling. It is also trying to protect the economy as much as it can.   It’s an impossible task, damned if they do and damned if they don’t.  Let’s all do our bit. Thanks PM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mate challenged me to get to 5k followers by this Friday. Long shot, but I’m giving it a try!   Thanks to all my new followers so far. Loving all you Conservatives, leavers, proud patriots and everyone in between!  Appreciate all follows and retweets 😃 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGov But 43% say they are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BritainElects @Survation Oh dear....think I better wait for survation. Oh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good, they have to go ahead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthea_bailey Lammy has one agenda, to get to power. He won’t let facts get in the way of that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thewrighteous2 @GowTolson Well the ones that are on SAGE. The ones that advise Government, you don’t just chop and change your advisors becuase you don’t like what they’re saying to you. Not how Government works<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ste942000 @thewrighteous2 @GowTolson Yea and as a person who went to uni, I know the parties I used to have day in day out. It’s clear rule breaking has caused this, mostly from uni students. That has now started to spread to older people. So clearly a lot of mixing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ste942000 @thewrighteous2 @GowTolson Also, the 10pm rule does force people to party int he street does it. No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ste942000 @thewrighteous2 @GowTolson It’s pretty obvious that the rule of 6 will limit the risk of spread. If I was infected and attended a house party of 30 people. That’s 30 people potentially infected. If I follow rule of six, I wouldn’t go. I’d only ever be able to spread to 5 people at the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thewrighteous2 @GowTolson Boris has to make the final call on it yes, after advice from his scientific and medical experts. He warned the country this would happen over a month ago if not all people stuck to the rules. House parties, huge gatherings in the street are fun, but they have consequences atm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ste942000 @Keir_Starmer @BorisJohnson That’s utter tripe. Having uni parties, house parties, mass gatherings in the streets, that’s what’s driven it. Going to uni in a pandemic is tough, but if people couldn’t stick to the rules, they shouldn’t have gone this yr. Lockdown were always coming if people took the piss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thewrighteous2 @GowTolson Well he did warn people a month or so ago of what would happen if not everyone followed the rules. Some thought it was funny to party in the street, have big house gatherings etc. Now we are all punished, inc businesses, with potential lockdowns becuase of those selfish people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Emmelle12345 @craigP_______ Grow up. I go out all the time, including to pubs, restaurants, gym etc. I just stick to things like the rule of six when I do. It’s not hard. It’s actually having consideration for others, more vulnerable people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely sick to the back teeth of @Keir_Starmer &amp; Labour always trying to exploit this crisis by blaming @BorisJohnson for everything. We were all told of the need to follow the rules or face the consequences of lockdowns. The Welsh Labour Government have done them in Wales.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour exploiting a pandemic again by blaming the Tories, when the Labour Government in Wales have done the same lockdowns. Labour locked down 80% of Wales! Lockdown measures weren’t inevitable, it was made clear that the ONLY way to avoid them was if EVERYONE stuck to the rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidLammy @BorisJohnson What a load of bollocks. No they weren’t inevitable, hence why a month ago he did a press conference and address stating that everyone must stick to the rules to avoid lockdown. Most did, some didn’t. It is those who are to blame. Boris or Government can’t stop it spreading.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thewrighteous2 @GowTolson Boris didn’t spread it, people did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why it was fundamental that everyone stuck to the rules to prevent lockdowns &amp; hospital admissions. If you were that selfish &amp; couldn’t stop yourself partying in the street, attending large house gatherings etc, then you should have at least stayed clear of anybody older.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Data shows that hospital admissions are now up due to the virus spreading from young to older people. Some said that as most cases were the young (who don’t get ill) there was no need for them to follow the rules. But they also clearly mixed with older people, as many predicted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly why you can’t trust @theSNP or @NicolaSturgeon.   Fact remains though, you have to resign @MargaretFerrier. There is no other option.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@milliedrane No worries. No just the ones doing as the please, but sadly, that’s all it takes and boom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@milliedrane @AlexIden2 @AJ_1066 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AJ_1066 There’s a few on the right as well that have surprised me. Crazy world atm ay!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@milliedrane My tweet was to the ones that haven’t followed the rules, when did I say you haven’t?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GwynneMP So basically, you admit that people are so selfish, that they will break the law to have a party. Nobody has to do something ‘illegal’. It’s a choice they make. If people hadn’t made that choice in the last month to break the rules, I doubt we’d be discussing lockdowns right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking forward to this. Campaign action long overdue!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cardanniz @craigh_uk @PaulBrandITV And if they did nothing, they would be accused of condemning people to death, like some said in April. Lose lose situation for them. Government is in an impossible situation where they are damned if they do and damned if they don’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AJ_1066 God knows. Though I’ve found a lot of people misreading it, interrupting it different, twisting it, imagining it says something different, anything to suit their agenda. Don’t know why I’m surprised, this is Twitter and there are some right idiots on here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the type of idiot on twitter.  I state that people who have broken Government rules/guidelines (which are there to help protect others &amp; to prevent more lockdowns) is what has caused cases to rise &amp; Boris to consider lockdowns. App that’s the same as domestic violence. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreitbartLondon @NeilJamesWeekes Don’t buy this stuff on No10 wooing Biden at all. Load of rubbish. Boris is close to Trump. Obvs have to prepare for every eventuality tho...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dixieburns8118 What for sticking to the rule of six? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kbeanie93 When did I say I wanted lockdowns? I don’t. I want things open. Hence why I’ve followed simple rule of six etc, to avoid lockdowns. If we all did that, there wouldn’t be lockdowns. Rise in covid is down to big house gatherings, parties etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cassalyn01 God knows how many house parties went on. Thing is I love massive gatherings, and had a houseparty planned this wknd myself, but cancelled it. I’d rather stick to the rules now and at least keep things open. Frustrating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenWallace_1 @craigP_______ What happens if that is still the case cone Dec? With lots of students having it? Where do they take it? Hmmm? That’s the issue isn’t it. It don’t stay just with young students 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnmcdonnellMP Get stuffed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChristopheCD When did I EVER say rule breaking was split n/s? I didn’t. It just happens that the cities I mentioned are some of the worst currently and had been rumoured to be locked down soon. Could happen anywhere if ppl break the basics and throw parties.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We’ve gone from arguing over remain or leave, to arguing over whether to let the virus rip or lockdown with tighter restrictions. I want a normal year back. It’s exhausting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Liv_Lever @Conservatives The Government has done loads to protect  jobs and businesses, spending hundreds of billions. ANY restrictions would do damage to the economy and jobs. There is no way the Government can do no restrictions in a pandemic. They warned the public to follow them to avoid lockdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pardonater Pandemic more like. Oh and we ain’t in recession anymore, will be confirmed next month when Q3 GDP figures come out. You’re welcome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Liv_Lever @Conservatives I hardly think any country is doing very well with the economy right now, or jobs. Difficult the have things booming when you have to put so many restrictions in place. We are in a global pandemic. We all know Labour would be far worse in this situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Liv_Lever @Conservatives If they did nothing and deaths spiralled (likely with cases going up and Christmas coming), they’d be accused of killing the elderly and vulnerable. They can’t win. They’re trying to balance health with economy. Think it’s quite unfair all the mud being slung at them tbh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craigh_uk @PaulBrandITV Wasn’t inevitable if people had stuck to the rules. Otherwise, all areas would have the same infection rate. They don’t. This is down to the rule breakers having large gatherings, parties etc. Admittedly a lot were uni parties, but they could have stuck to rules &amp; not had them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bhuyton1995 So that all businesses are closed? Clever idea, not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BevFink Agreed. It’s all the house parties and indoor gatherings that were against the rules that have done most of it, inc uni students. But Government can’t enforce rules on that if people are determined to break them, so they then have only hospitality left. So unfair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Liv_Lever Apart from the ones doing it. I agree, they were idiots. Few selfish people have created the mess &amp; people who have followed the rules, as well as businesses will suffer. It’s awful, but the Government warned people a month ago of the consequences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Feel sorry for all the businesses that have to close and all the people who abided by the rules. So cruel and such a shame. This could have been avoided if everyone had listened and abided by the rules during the last month. People were warned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears That’s not my point, I don’t claim to be an expert about what works. My point is, the Government warned a month ago that if people don’t abide by the rules and cases rise too much, they’ll have to go further, to a more lockdown approach. So those who didn’t listen, are to blame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears No, the people who had large gatherings in homes, house parties, partied in the street, didn’t follow the rules after being warned of the consequences, will be to blame. Government can’t do nothing when cases are sky high there.They said a month ago of the importance of the rules<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @BorisJohnson @MattHancock Whether you agree with it or not, a 10pm closing time for most people means go home, not have a party or games in the street. Clearly don’t care about the risk of spreading the virus...the same people will complain if their parents get it or pubs are closed down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He’s gone from stealing #BuildBackBetter from @BorisJohnson, to now stealing lines from both @theresa_may and @jeremycorbyn. Does that man have anything original to say? 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think we can all guess why.... ditch the rhetoric or scrap it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CollinsMikeyc When did I say lockdowns worked or I was in favour of them? Oh that’s right, I didn’t. I don’t claim to be an expert. BUT, what I did say is that if people don’t follow the rules that are there to prevent lockdowns, then at some point, they’ll be brought in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ycreevy The cases up north? Probably not no. Though if people flout them in London too, no doubt it’ll end up the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hotshorts305 Think I’ve missed the boat on this one ay 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnaBritannia We are in a different place now, cases a lot more in circulation that the summer, though the main thing I believe that will drive it is gatherings in homes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryLouise_84 Same could happen anywhere if people don’t follow the rules, just currently worse in the cities I mentioned. 2 weeks ago we saw videos like this in Liverpool. It only goes to prove my point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulfish2skyco2 Don’t believe a word this paper says anymore, it’s mostly lies since it got a new editor in chief.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laura04861663 @jeremy_hume When did I say to sit indoors and not go out? I certainly don’t do that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRustler83 You in had to stick to the rules using eat out to help out, as well as covid secure offices. So not sure of your  point?  It’s clear that some do not follow the rules, uni parties, house gatherings etc. They are pushing the cases up. Rules are there to prevent lockdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let this be true 🙏🏼  Though I fear Sturgeon can do no wrong to most in Scotland. The media don’t scrutinise her, nor do they pressure that ghastly SNP Margaret Ferrier, that has disgraced herself of late, to resign. Soon people wake up, the better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice fresh crisp day for a walk, clear the mind! Maybe get blown into the pub on the way back...#sundayvibes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wereIgoOne You do realise it can spread to others don’t you? That’s the point...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SheelaghG And what happened then? Oh yes, we got locked down 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craigP_______ @AnnieMacF2 @LennyStone11 You do realise with Christmas coming, if the infection rate is massively high with the young, that will spread to older ppl rapidly. That’s the situation that’s dangerous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craigP_______ Meet Craig.   Craig thinks he’s funny, when in fact nobody is laughing.   Despite what Craig says, Kevin goes out all the time, but limits his groups to 6 to help limit the risk of others catching covid.   Kevin doesn’t listen to the media, but is sensible. Be more like Kevin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SheelaghG When did I say that? Do keep up. These are just the places mostly likely to be locked down, as they have some of the highest rates of covid. Same goes for the south if people don’t all follow the rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beasant_a Lockdowns are the result of people not following the simple rules now, that will keep cases from spiking ridiculously high.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hobbhammer24 Well depends if people stick to the rules don’t it. If not, probably in a few weeks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hauntedspookz So the Government had a growing economy, record employment, decades low unemployment, deficit was massively cut, an 80 majority, was delivering brexit, but then they thought...’you know what, I’m going to destroy all that to control the people’. Wake up and stop talking garbage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR Our death figures are already starting to rise, as well as hospital admissions. Nobody wants lockdowns or closures of businesses, but people do need to start taking the rules more seriously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ingajula @leeds2d You don’t think young people will see parents and grandparents at Christmas? I don’t think that’s really something I need a crystal ball for, pretty obvious. It’s also obvious that if people with covid then spread it, it will have disastrous consequences. Grow up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UK_4_Democracy @BeverlyDaubney @BorisJohnson It’s a pandemic, get a grip. He is also taking back control from the EU at the same time, as well as many other things to protect Britain and its culture. I have every faith in Boris.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve triggered a few today! 👀👀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sy1_iol @jeremy_hume They are massively starting to jump yes. And as we get nearer to Christmas, that’s likely to go up further.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@truckingfridge And then they start mixing with older people and go home for Christmas to see parents and grandparents and boom! What you think happens then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Silverf34781188 Errr, when did I say that? It just happens that the northern cities are the worst atm. If people in the south don’t follow the rules, the same will happen there. Love the way ignorant people try and twist what I say 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MickeyM76533319 @demi_lynne701 I’m keen to avoid lockdowns. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WayneGrimshaw7 @jeremy_hume When did I say that? It just so happens that currently, they are the worst places. Wherever you are, if people want pubs to stay open and places not to be locked down, people need to stick to the main rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dalcon02 Cases have started creeping up, so that kind of kills that argument off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@newtok64 And the way to avoid lockdowns?!? Stick to the effing rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dickturpin02 Well, I’d like the pubs etc to remain open. Keeping cases low is the only way to do thats. I also don’t want a huge wave of deaths after Christmas because all the young took it home to parents and grandparents in the thousands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LordBrexit Simple answer to that. The cases per 100k arn’t at the levels in London as they are of some other cities. London is fairly low compared to the likes of Liverpool. But who knows what will happen, cases can spiral very quickly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sanshee01 Well that’s a selfish attitude and will end up with the country in lockdown. I and many I know, stick to the rules, including the rule of six in pubs and in houses. I cancelled by housewarming party this wknd, because I thought we were all in this together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scotty01041874 @sanshee01 Me too 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sanshee01 That would be a very last resort. I don’t agree with shutting down businesses, but the Government is running out of options if people don’t stop flouting rules such as the rule of 6. We’re all in this together, but some selfish people mess it up for everyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Islamicat I dont agree with BLM protests or the political Marxist organisation behind them. Let’s not confuse my tweet now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeHForThe3rdT1 @demi_lynne701 I’ve massively called those out Lee, on numerous occasions. So let’s not be selective to just one of my tweets, which was regarding what could get locked down. I don’t want lockdowns, but the country has been warned that they’ll come if we don’t ALL stick to some basic rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gyourys @jeremy_hume Deaths and hospital admissions are slowly creeping up. The young getting it would be fine, if they never mixed with older people. Problem is, that ain’t going to happen, especially approaching Christmas. Hence why people need to stick to the rules to avoid lockdowns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sanshee01 Eat out to help out was done in pubs and restaurants in a covid secure way. Limit to people per group, social distancing etc. The rise in cases is mostly coming from uni areas and inside people’s homes from large gatherings &amp; no social distancing. Some people are breaking rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Couldn’t agree more with this. Trump would be better for the UK than Biden ever would.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Deene20919373 I don’t know how that correlates with what I said, but whatever. The actions of everybody has a consequence on everyone. If you mix with 30 in a party, pick it up, don’t show symptoms, then travel home, see parents, grandparents, it spreads further, people get ill. Grow up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leeds2d Agreed. The problem comes when they start mixing with older people, parents, grandparents. It will happen, especially as we approach Christmas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t think she speaks for the many up north, maybe just the few.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grizedale2974 @Sunpoches It’s just frustrating, as we all then face the consequences, including businesses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RendleGary @ninahazelby Switched off a few weeks back. Gone right down in my estimations this year!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Garynjordan Yes and any place that ends up with tougher restrictions or a lockdown, is down to the same reason of people not abiding by the rules. My point was that it’s likely to only be those areas potentially locked down currently, as they have spiralled the most.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour as usual, trying to whip up a storm against the Government, during a pandemic. Classy. Absolutely pathetic, but wouldn’t expect anything else from @lisanandy. How angry was the north when she was trying to overturn the result of the referendum, that they voted for? VERY.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really can’t stand Nicola Sturgeon, she’s just so false. Only thing I do agree with her on, is the fact that Covid MP Margaret Ferrier needs to resign. #Ridge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liz_brown2020 If you think 100% of people are following the rules, there is no massive gatherings happening in homes and no house parties going on, you’re deluded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If true, this is big news. Our history, &amp; culture must be protected from the lefties.   With so many Labour Councils and dodgy Labour Mayors like @SadiqKhan wanting to erase our history and tear some statues down, I was worried.   This is massively welcome @BorisJohnson 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@conservative245 Congratulations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simonbayley @knackered007 If she was Tory MP, it would have been in the media every day wall to wall coverage and she would have been forced to resign. No MP should get away with what she has done. It’s not about what party she is from, it’s about doing the right thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a feeling these polls are overstating Biden. He may be ahead nationally, but I think it’ll be a lot tougher in the states that will decide this election. I definitely wouldn’t right @realDonaldTrump off yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Using any excuse to keep her £80k salary, whilst taking us for mugs. The sheer audacity of Margaret Ferrier to come out with this, after travelling the length of the country knowing she had covid. Absolutely disgraceful behaviour. Literally no shame at all.🤬 #ResignFerrier #Marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willrb5 @MoS_Politics He hasn’t flouted them, it’s false. Other MPs have stated that he had already left. Which shows, that fake news is still alive and kicking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, if true, @BorisJohnson isn’t wrong. Get Trade Deal Done.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What the hell. Even #thewall was emotional tonight. What a night for emotions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uncleporkie Very. I went to put on the wall, really wasn’t expecting that. It got me massively when it happened. So incredibly sad, but was lovely seeing her happy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just accidentally caught #Strictly and a Caroline Flack tribute is on.   What a lovely tribute, so awesome to see her so happy. Quite emotional. Love Caroline, sadly missed. ❤️❤️❤️❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bring on Dec 31, trade deal or no trade deal. 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BoerboelUK @Helen29260350 Done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PennsylTrumpli1 @Saddlerlad Followed. Could do with some myself too if anybody wants to give us a follow 😃 🇺🇸 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Streakyblue1951 😂 we thought about dividing it up slightly, but it woudnt work. Defeats the object as well. We’ve pushed it to the new year now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was meant to be mine and my besties house warming tonight. We cancelled it as 30+ were coming. Another mate was having a birthday gathering in a pub tonight, who we both knew, would have taken it to 7 if we both went, so I didn’t go.   What a year it has been!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Deaths from covid today:  England had 60 deaths for a population of 56 million.  Wales had 21 deaths for a population of 3 million.   Scotland had 6 deaths for a population of 5 million.  What are the Labour Welsh Government doing? That’s a very high death rate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rumamay @JohnLibNat @jeremy_hume Couple of things on that, first - a lot of those were outdoors and did involve small groups on beaches socially distant.  second - cases were not as high then, they are much higher now and is spreading indoors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayCar1000 That was the scary one, then to get over that, the second haha!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timmo_Crowley That’s the problem isn’t it....we will only get through all this, if we all do our bit and pull together. British bulldog spirit needed!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HeathNewton6 If that’s what you took from that tweet, that says more about you than me.  I believe the vast majority are fully trying their best to stick to the rules. But there are people who deliberately flout them, attend huge house gatherings, parties etc. That has consequences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you’re complaining about the negatives of potential full lockdowns, but BROKE the simple rules that were in place to PREVENT those lockdowns. You’re an idiot.   Nobody wants lockdowns, there are so many negative consequences, but people were warned to stick to the rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Monty_London I didn’t say lockdowns work, I believe there are major negatives to doing it, but what I said was that people were warned of the consequences of rule breaking. Any full lockdowns are becuase of selfish people breaking simple rules, that were in place to PREVENT lockdowns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnLibNat @jeremy_hume I believe most are, my point is not all are. I’ve seen the pictures, I know people living in Manchester who have seen people going to house-parties, huge uni social gatherings etc. It’s the rule breakers that have caused the spike. Unfortunately the majority get punished then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremy_hume If people socially distanced &amp; stuck to the rule of six, the spread would not be as high in those areas. I’ve seen tons of people breaking the rules, having parties, big gatherings etc. Rule breaking has contributed to cases being higher in certain areas, esp student uni areas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If rumours are true &amp; Boris does fully lockdown the likes of Manchester, Liverpool &amp; Newcastle, it will be down to the people in those areas who haven’t been following the rules. We’ve all seen the pictures of rule breaking. People were warned of the consequences a month ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RickSacrop @DailyMailUK New editor since Dacre left isn’t a Boris or Brexit fan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So basically it’s a 50/50 split &amp; so no matter what the government does, half will potentially disagree. Such a tough balancing act. I feel that people need to start appreciating that the government is doing all it can, but fundamentally, it comes down to each &amp; every one of us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You never sometimes know who is suffering. I think a lot of us have had  major down days since covid struck,  the key is to make sure that doesn’t escalate to something far bigger, support each other guys. Make sure everyone knows the below 👇🏼  #WorldMentalHealthDay  https://t.co/qY0FQRrCNP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely shameful. What a waste of police time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AddictScrabble Haha! Not sure Twitter wants that 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would 💯 agree with this. I’ve seen stuff coming out of the Biden camp that isn’t good for the 🇺🇸 or 🇬🇧.  Was only yesterday they were having a pop at our PM @BorisJohnson.   Love him or hate him, @realDonaldTrump is the best man for the job. Hope he wins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We all know #London Labour Mayor @SadiqKhan lies, evident below👇🏼, but he can’t even do his job. His serial incompetence is off the scale. He’s failed on just about everything &amp; gets away with it. Yet again, he’s begging for billions in bailout from Government. It can’t go on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Note to @Keir_Starmer &amp; @UKLabour:  You’re entitled to your own opinion, but you arn’t entitled to your own facts.   Stop lying, stop misleading. The country deserves better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenMacDhui10 @SteveLaws19 You mean because he’s had to do non Conservative things that no other PM has had to do, becuase of the coronavirus pandemic 🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PositiveAbraham @KEdge23 #boom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seen a lot of anti-British lefty tweets in the last couple of days. What is so shameful, is they are from Labour MPs. How can anybody support that.

<|startoftext|>This is so ridiculous. @pritipatel has to constantly fight to deport anybody. Sooner Dec 31 comes and we can start changing the laws, the better!   https://t.co/4sKwJ4KmU9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PositiveAbraham Appreciate all follows! 🇬🇧 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m so going to lose this bet 😂 🤦🏼‍♂️ Where’s all the conservatives at?   Thanks to all that have followed, I swear I’m worth it! 😬 what I’ve learnt with twitter, is to always stick together &amp; not be silenced by the left. Say what you really think &amp; stick up for what you believe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He’s back!!!! T.R.U.M.P 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoHolz @dosepoet #BOOM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quite funny really. Serves them right for trying to cancel Brexit.   May they spend a life time in oblivion. Hopefully they’ll take @Keir_Starmer with them, and most of the Labour Party. No party in Parliament, other than the @Conservatives respected democracy and our votes. 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whatever you think, that is a bit far fetched. Why would the government lie about the threat of COVID? @Conservatives had created record high employment &amp; the lowest unemployment in decades. Deficit had been massively cut. Government would not damage the economy for no reason.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FauxGeordie Things is, I think it’s all put on. They can’t be that dense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AJ_1066 Oh I hate Marr now. He doesn’t interview properly and never listens to the answers. It’s constantly looking for a gotcha moment to get some attention. Pathetic. Bit like a lot of the media these days. It’s all about their careers, rather than proper journalism and facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FauxGeordie It’s normally Boris bashing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is #Gogglebox still left wing? Only really watch the celeb one.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KulganofCrydee @MrTCHarris It’s similar to how they were with Brexit, say remain one day, leave the next. They believe if they keep going back and for on the issue, people will be so confused, they’ll support them anyway. They are playing games as usual. Labour just can’t be trusted, they don’t learn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidLammy @RishiSunak No he hasn’t, stop lying. He’s expanding the job support scheme. Grow up for a change. Do you ever say anything positive or constructive? I only ever see you complaining, lying, misleading and trying to create racial divides.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vickyintheuk Your post was up for 5 hrs spreading inaccurate claims before you posted a correction comment. I guess you didn’t wanna lose the likes. If I was a Gov MP sticking to the rules, I wouldn’t want to be classed as the same as an SNP MP who travels with covid or the Labour MP above.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vickyintheuk I read it, but be serious, many don’t. Either way, what you posted was inaccurate. Hence why your main tweet should have been deleted &amp; re-posted. The Government is very different to Parliament, Labour are a diff party. We wouldn’t have general elections if they were the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vickyintheuk @NickOwen50 @ExitEightyFour Facts do matter yea!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who does everyone WANT to win the 🇺🇸 election?   Who would be better for the UK...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welcome support from @RishiSunak &amp; @Conservatives.  I must stress, the best way to avoid businesses being forced to shut &amp; needing this support, is by each &amp; every one of us sticking to the basic rules. We can all socially distance &amp; stick to the rule of six. Bulldog spirit 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched the ‘Roast of Donald Trump’ just before he decided to run for president. Absolutely hilarious!! He was on 🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AJ_1066 @liztred I can’t help but laugh it’s so ridiculous, especially on camera 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dean64916878 A bet is a bet! I’ll give you a follow! 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UKLabour That’s why the country would never vote for @Keir_Starmer. He can’t decide what he wants one day to the next. If he does decide, he changes it the next day. Support the rule of six one day, abstain on it the next. The country could do without the lack of leadership from Labour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who would be the worst president for America. Something like that? 🤷🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Personally, I think this would be wrong.   To be clear, this is not a Government decision or that of MPs. An independent body decides.   SNP's Margaret Ferrier must be loving life. Maybe she can use it to compensate all the people she infected....  https://t.co/blpPeegIky<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HTScotPol What if people are in doubt about her, can we close her down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TiceRichard @PeterBa82304711 What a load of bollocks. Some of the people around these days would have been saying the same about Churchill during the war.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shelbycobra642 @PheniceMccall @shelbysnake2 @fatima_italia @BelannF @KLB4USA @1ADJUTOR @1ursus @jpd176 @Q2Truth @texasrecks @MyTrigger_1 Trump for the win. Drain the swamp.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR Debatable, but generally one of the safest places &amp; I spend a lot of time in them. What I don’t get is why haven’t some with big followers on here, been pushing the rules on twitter more to prevent the risk of them being shut. It was vital that people didn’t break the rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“It doesn’t matter how long it takes you to get somewhere. Keep going. You’ll get there!” #FridayMotivation 👊🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR Ok, I see your point. On my point, I believe even if pubs were all closed, infections would still be rising. As you state, pubs aren’t the main cause, but the mains causes, hard for the Government to enforce. Maybe some with huge followers should have promoted the rules more<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adsantweets @EssexPR Where do you think a lot of university students get it? Parties, in their halls, homes etc. Plus, it’s been said that a lot is coming from homes, but difficult to enforce. I don’t believe the suggestion a bulk is from offices, so many wfh &amp; offices should be covid secure anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR Agreed. BECAUSE, not everyone is following the rules. Far too many breaking the key rule of six &amp; social distancing rules. Too much spread in homes, parties etc. Sticking to those rules are key to keeping everything open &amp; limiting the spread. Maybe push that on your twitter?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AJ_1066 I used to have lots of green parakeets in the trees by me, way too many to name though.  But was cool waking up to them chirping, unless it was at 6am 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanWecancan @DailyMailUK Enlighten me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AJ_1066 Cute!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK Why should the whole UK be plunged into lockdown, killing off businesses &amp; livelihoods, all because a minority amount of selfish people refuse to abide by the rules, continue to party in large groups &amp; socially mix in homes. This isn’t the Government that’s to blame!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Keep it coming. @theSNP need to be exposed, as does @NicolaSturgeon.   Then there’s @MargaretFerrier. Why hasn’t she resigned yet? Why are the media not on her case? She seems to have vanished into thin air, but is still stealing from the tax payers she purposely tried to infect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is WITH a biased and negative media. Keep going @BorisJohnson. Once we’ve all got through covid and the Brexit transition period has ended, we can flourish and prosper like never before. @Conservatives will always be the party of the people, the workers, the NHS &amp; economy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@talkRADIO He’s on the money. Biden and Karmela are lying their way through the campaign, and be in no doubt the media are doing the same to help him. As much as so many hate Trump in the UK, he’d be so much better in terms of being an ally, security cooperation &amp; doing a trade deal. 🇬🇧 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biggest #FridayThoughts right now are the British media are a disgrace.  Constantly streaming negativity &amp; fear. We don’t need that right now. Everything you see in the media is doom and gloom, spun in a negative way. It’s lies, misleading stories, depressive &amp; anti-British.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dpjermy @afneil I don’t agree with lockdowns or really tough restrictions, but let’s be serious, the Government wouldn’t even contemplate that if cases weren’t going up. The fact there was 17k new cases yesterday shows people are mixing in homes, not sticking to rule of 6 or socially distant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.⁦@RishiSunak⁩ to the rescue again. This will be welcome relief to businesses that are forced to shut in the coming weeks.   However, it will increase debt further &amp; this isn’t sustainable. This was avoidable if everyone had followed the covid rules.  https://t.co/2xM5OJnvev<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acgrayling Tough. Accept the result and move of for goodness sake. We have left the EU and with @BorisJohnson leading the @Conservatives, I’m sure we will prosper post covid and the transition period.  You can’t live your life harping on about something that is NOT going to happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All because some selfish people can’t stick to the guidelines.  We were warned over a month ago to stick to social distancing &amp; abide by the rule of 6, otherwise cases would rise &amp; tougher restrictions would be enforced. Now we all suffer, businesses fall and the economy teeters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The biggest threat in America at the moment is from certain violent BLM protesters and leftist thugs that are looting, vandalising and causing complete carnage on the streets. Tell your own supporters to stop before you start carping at @realDonaldTrump and the right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afneil Remember we had massive growth in July. Expect a substantial Q3 growth figure when it comes out in November.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After finally getting to 3k followers, my mate just bet me that I can’t get to 5k followers by next Friday.   I told him that all with all my fellow patriots, Brexit supporters, Conservatives, Boris backers and MAGA enthusiasts, then surely I have a chance!   Appreciate any help!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Work from home = messy hair. 💁🏼‍♂️  Happy Friday folks! #Friyay #FridayVibes  https://t.co/xr2xC9XUJS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeathNewton6 We are in a completely different scenario now. My point is, cases wouldn’t be rising at the rapid rate they are,  if everyone were following the social distancing and rule of six. The spread is mostly coming from parties and inside people’s homes. Just a few can cause a spike.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do miss seeing Big Ben. Definitely not the same with him all encased in scaffolding &amp; not chiming.  Something very British about him and his powerful chimes across #London. Looking forward to those first regular chimes next year as a fully independent country.   🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧  https://t.co/OGdNQv1QVX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realgreatbrit Followed 🇬🇧👊🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is no reason not to hold the #Debates2020 as scheduled, in person and live. @realDonaldTrump will be free of covid by then, and as long as he passes a test negative, as should Biden, what’s the issue?    Thoroughly looking forward to seeing Trump on the campaign trail!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanEacock I don’t like her, but @piersmorgan is worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adsantweets Up north a lot of the rise in cases is coming from either students not social distancing, having parties etc &amp; it spreading in people’s homes. IF people followed the rules in place, we wouldn’t need to shut down the economy. It has to be a balance but selfish people will f it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If people know what’s good for them, they won’t bother tuning in.  You were absolutely terrible in the debate last night. Very snidy, arrogant, rude and spent most the time lying.   Supporting @realDonaldTrump and @Mike_Pence for the win. 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How do we avoid a second national lockdown &amp; pub/bar closures? Stick to the simple rules.   If all people had followed the guidelines a month ago, we wouldn’t have curfews. There wouldn’t be a risk of businesses being closed down next week. This is down to a few selfish people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelenHu72755540 I like that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I watched the #VicePresidentialDebate last night, then looked at American news sites, NONE of it was accurate. It was all so anti Pence &amp; full of misleading information about the debate. It’s pretty obvious why @realDonaldTrump talks about fake news so much. Pretty disgraceful...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Seagull_Phil 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally on the ropes? I hope so.  @theSNP seem to get away with far too much. Has @MargaretFerrier resigned yet?  @NicolaSturgeon has managed to hoodwink most voters. She’s one of the most power crazed, incompetent &amp; deceitful people in politics. Sooner she’s unmasked the better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcusinstroud Cheers! 😊 Might be cheeky and go for the 4k 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jools_miss It’s been a tough 11 years 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anybody wear any cool masks?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Roger4Richmond Hahaha! Thanks man! Your prize is....I’ll follow you back! 😂 Happy Thursday! 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AddictScrabble Yay! May as well go for 4K followers now 😜😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So close to 3k followers! Will I get there? 🤷🏼‍♂️   Would have only taken 11 years 😂  Help us out folks!! 😀 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If people continue to flout the rules, the Government will be forced to do tougher measures. I don’t support closing pubs, bars etc, as it destroys businesses. Problem is, there isn’t much more the Government can do if people continue to flout the current rules. Ppl were warned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If people followed the rule of 6 &amp; made sure they followed social distancing, there is no way new cases would now be at 17k per day. People complain when the Government introduces tighter measures, curfews etc, but they only do that because people are breaking the rules!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s clear that university students are really helping to drive the huge increase in cases, as well as young people in general. The worrying stats are that with hospital admissions starting to jump, it implies the young are mixing with older people as well. Why? Follow the rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In some positive news...it’s Friday tomorrow! 🤪 Not quite the same meaning as it used to have...but we should all try to relax, do something happy or just have fun. So many people are suffering during this pandemic, let’s all pick each other up if somebody is having a down day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@poba66 Exactly! No way it could spread this much if people stuck to the main rules. Problem is, impossible for Government to enforce the rules in people’s homes, so it comes down to hospitality venues. Selfish people are causing all this hardship on ppl and businesses, not Government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s @theSNP Scottish Government under @NicolaSturgeon for you. Dictatorship &amp; power is all that matters to them.   Complete failure keeping the ‘stay at home’ message going for as long as they did. Didn’t achieve much with Scotland having a worse case rate than England.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scomipbanhalal9 @DavidLammy 💯 Been saying that myself for years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As I predicted. Labour may throw some digs at Boris and continually chop &amp; change, but they don’t have any other ideas themselves, nor do they want to take any risk of being blamed for a rise in cases.   Labour doesn’t have new leadership with Starmer, it has no leadership.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It seems the reason vast areas of the north have spiralling cases, is becuase its spreading INSIDE people’s houses, despite the rules stating households shouldn’t be mixing in many areas. That is impossible for Government to enforce, so people are being completely irresponsible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does @DavidLammy have to make every single issue in this country about race &amp; the colour of somebody’s skin. It’s not about that.   Any crisis this country faces, we face it together, not divided. One United Kingdom 🇬🇧   I really can’t stand this man👇🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGov Bonkers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This woman Kamala is on the Biden ticket. She was absolutely infuriating and rude. Anybody who says she won the #debate is off their head.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mercerboy @rickklein @BretBaier @Kjwalsh_news She had more chances to speak, hence why spoke more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They aren’t wrong. Kamala was absolutely bat shit annoying and not somebody I would trust in office.  #VicePresidentialDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Clear Pence win. The sneering and rudeness of Kamala was so off putting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He did a great job to be fair, especially against the sneering &amp; rude Kamala Harris.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pence in my view is doing so much better. He talks to the American people properly, and he’s professional.   Kamala is infuriating me with the way she sneers, almost arrogance as she states ‘she’s speaking’.   Has to be @VP Pence for me in this. #VicePresidentialDebate2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really not liking @KamalaHarris. What is it with her expressions? Talks down to the people &amp; doesn’t stop staring down the cam.   Also, the moderator is not giving equal time to Pence at all. He’s getting way less time. Absolute fix to say otherwise. #VicePresidentialDebate2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahaha #BuildBackBetter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If people continue not abiding by any of the rules, more &amp; more tighter restrictions will be introduced, that most of us will hate, or not agree too. The Government has to be seen to do everything it can to stop the virus spreading too fast, so can we at least try to do our bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the north of England has spiralling cases &amp; the rest of England is only increasing slowly, it’s not that tighter restrictions can’t work, it’s that certain people, in certain areas are not following the rules. Government can’t stop the virus spreading, only people can. 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@01ivi3r1u6 @realDonaldTrump @BorisJohnson More of a European is it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nostradonny @realDonaldTrump @BorisJohnson Completely ridiculous to take a snapshot in the middle of a pandemic. All countries are facing a tough time economically atm. ANY leader would.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awwwwww. Don’t you just love @realDonaldTrump and @BorisJohnson 💙 🇬🇧 🇺🇸   I hope they do get to work together for many many years to come.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@apple_shwn Is it worth watching? I would for Trump, but not sure for this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ghost_wales I agree, but it ain’t going to happen. So all we can do is push for a Conservative win next year. It’s hard, becuase so many in Wales can’t see the wood for the trees.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toadmeister Scotland shouldn’t get any extra money from the UK Government if she is going to go rogue and do what she likes. Maybe only then, people will see she isn’t good for Scotland.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>💯 agree.  Labour have had too much control over Wales for far too long. The NHS is worse under Labour, money poorly managed, and they have shown serial incompetence through the whole covid pandemic.   Wales needs a Conservative Welsh Government. Build Wales Better. 🇬🇧 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s the problem with the Labour Mayor @SadiqKhan, Labour Welsh leader @fmwales &amp; UK Labour leader @Keir_Starmer, they all lie. They say one thing, then when it doesn’t work with some people, they change tact &amp; say something else.   You can’t trust Captain Hindsight or Labour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCPolitics Typical media guess work and speculation. Probably done to dilute the shit Sturgeon was getting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Drinks 🍹  https://t.co/bgNGvYDkrs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Off to the pub, I need a drink.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is there a debate in America tonight?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad sad sad. What are these two doing? Honestly, I worry for some in this country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Egotistical and bitter sums you up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Devongirl_64 @MetroUK She’ll ask Boris to pay wages. That’s why she wanted the furlough to be extended for 2 years. Woman is stark raving mad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never forget Captain Hindsight and his Brexit blocking treachery.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👀👀👀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good. More steps like this please!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤯🤯 somebody remove this woman. Cancelled exams for NEXT year, ban on alcohol sales in pubs, whatever crazy thing is coming next.   My guess is the bulk of Scotland will think she’s wonderful and continue to blame Boris for everything, while begging for some extra money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmil14865981 @HHepplewhite @theSNP That’s the problem. Same as people in Wales are blaming Boris for their lockdowns, even thought it’s Labour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems like they’re the virus too. It’s over here in the UK too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@talkRADIO @DCBMEP Because that’s right, covid is in the alcohol itself 🙄. Nothing more that a completely crazed, power hungry, delusional, incompetent SNP Government, led by nut job Nicola Sturgeon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarianWillough5 @theSNP Absolutely crazy. She wants independence, but can’t lead effectively or financially stand alone. So heavily reliant on England. Nicola is actually delusional<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremy_hume @RossHampton12 @HHepplewhite @theSNP Im happy to support the rule of 6 for a short period to limit the spread, but it’s Labour in Wales banning alcohol sales passed 10pm in supermarkets, and SNP in Scotland banning alcohol sales in pubs that I find disturbing and power crazy. I hope Boris doesn’t attempt that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sturgeon’s &amp; @theSNP power grab in Scotland is taking shape. Pubs banned from selling alcohol is bonkers. Businesses destroyed &amp; livelihoods ruined.  The woman is unhinged. She’s completely out of her depth and will come running to Boris for money to bail Scotland out 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNewsBreak While others she’s saying can’t serve alcohol. SNP Nicola Sturgeon has completely lost it.  Incompetent, power crazy, deceiving, sneaky nut job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes @BorisJohnson. We may not like all the restrictions, we may not agree with them all, but Boris is leading and doing what he can to protect lives and the economy.   Labour Keir Starmer doesn’t lead, he just chops &amp; changes.   SNP Nicola Sturgeon has lost it. Utter mad woman.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is nuts.   Banning alcohol sales in pubs &amp; bars?!? Say whhhhaaaat?   If people can’t see that the SNP &amp; @NicolaSturgeon aren’t power hungry, then I give up.   She wants independence, but wants UK money. She wants praise on covid, but has lost control of it. She’s a failure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sturgeon has gone mad. Absolutely power crazy and has lost control of the covid situation in much of Scotland.   Incompetent nut job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nicola Sturgeon is on the war path. This is going to be so hugely damaging. Will the SNP Scottish Government be helping businesses?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR The right way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears Rule of 6 is not a lockdown, it’s to avoid one. Its just limiting the risk of spreading it to a much wider group. It’s about lowering the risk. Nobody NEEDS to be in groups bigger than 6 during a pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears But you’ll get massive house parties all over the country, every single week, covid will rip through everyone, and it’ll all end up back with elderly and vulnerable people by Christmas. If not, at Christmas.  10pm rule - maybe that can be looked at, but I fully support rule of 6.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears I’m not talking about backbencers. The Welsh Labour Government and the Scottish SNP Government have also done curfews, so businesses there will also be in the same position. This isn’t a Conservative problem.   Out of interest, would you have any restrictions? I’m assuming not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears Labour in Wales and the SNP in Scotland have put in the same curfews, and have actually gone further on other restrictions than the Conservatives. To blame the Conservatives for all this is ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why doesn’t Starmer speak to his Labour colleagues in Wales? Labour control the Welsh Government &amp; they make decisions on restrictions there. Perhaps he could have a chat with @fmwales, as there is a curfew in Wales too...  No leadership by Starmer at all, just games #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbclaurak If Government lost a vote on the 10pm curfew, and cases went up massively, then the Conservatives could blame Labour. Big risk for them to vote against it....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Starmer banging on about how he supports the Rule of Six to get infections down, but then forces his party to abstain last night.   Labour playing politics with the nations health. Twirling around &amp; flipping all over the place.  It’s not new leadership, it’s NO leadership. #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If that’s the case, it’s people not abiding by the rules. It doesn’t help that Labour one day support the rules, next day they don’t. That undermines what are there to help defeat the virus.  It’s not the Government that can stop the spread, it’s each and every one of us.  #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@BorisJohnson on @Keir_Starmer: “This isn’t new leadership, this is no leadership”.  Couldn’t agree more. Labour are flip flopping all over the place. One day the support Government, next day they don’t. An incompetent party, with no vision, no policies and no leadership. #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As he said 👇🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattBreretonCCC Exactly. Don’t doubt that Nicola Sturgeon is a very dangerous, deceiving, manipulative &amp; untrustworthy woman. Everything is a front &amp; yet nobody really scrutinises her, leaving her to get away with major failures &amp; incompetence. Scotland voters need to wake up to her power trip.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think Boris is right.  We see it day in day out, lefty lawyers protecting the people entering this country illegally, protecting the terrorists. We often find the legal profession putting the criminals ‘human rights’ above the safety of the law abiding citizens in this country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just don’t trust this woman. She somehow manages to hoodwink &amp; deceive most Scottish voters.  Regardless of this inquiry, she is a sneaky &amp; slippery character. She manages to hide the incompetence of the SNP Government and all its failures.   https://t.co/ncJ8VuVzzr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, 4 hours of work meetings done already today. Somebody get me a drink!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dominiquetaegon We’re in a bit of a non normal period. Policies right now that some people question, are purely covid related, these won’t last beyond 6 months. Some will phase out before. Then the party will steam ahead on full Conservative values and policies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are the polls in America really shifting so crazily to Biden?! If they are, America has lost it. Biden is seriously weak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellGardner A few things, mostly because he told them to abstain in Parliament today and he agrees with the Government 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quite funny watching the left implode on twitter and going after Starmer with getting #ResignStarmer trending. Oh how I love it when all the lefty tossers get triggered.  https://t.co/YWMWKECfrv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big thanks to all my new followers. Massively welcome.   Big fan of 🇺🇸 and 🇬🇧 politics and a strong Conservative.   Appreciate all follows and retweets. Together we are stronger. 🇬🇧👍🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mikey1732 @ninahazelby Yup. Biden would be a disaster for UK trade.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She is literally the worst. Anybody she hasn’t blocked on twitter?! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Conservatives unite.   I’m also a young (ish) Conservative on twitter. I’d also really appreciate a follow and a retweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Psycho_Hamster Thanks Jeff, it’s been a hard slog to get rid of it, but uni is definitely worth it. Hopefully she has a wikid time, esp once we get through covid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is powerful &amp; shows she is lying, much like the UK media do here daily.   ‘Mostly peaceful protests’ is the headline, while in the background BLM protesters are throwing bikes at horses, attacking police, throwing flares, vandalising, destroying statues and fighting 🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely love this 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GermieManick Can’t keep us down<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Final student loan repayment goes out this month, get in!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iromg He’s bloody right as well. It’s a nasty, Marxist political organisation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Woadrunar Jail would be better!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the below sums things up pretty well regarding the SNP and Margaret Ferrier.   Could this story get any more ridiculous though. She seems to have vanished off the earth since we all got wind of her vile behaviour and yet she STILL hasn’t resigned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🇬🇧 UPDATE 🇬🇧    Evening twitter world!! Hope everyone is doing well &amp; you’ve all had an awesome day!   To all my fellow Conservatives out there, chuffed that Boris smashed his speech today and hopefully lifted everyone a bit.   Would very much appreciate a follow and a retweet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acgrayling You’re the disaster. Brexit will be what we make of it. The @Conservatives under @BorisJohnson will make a success of it. Move on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All of us Conservatives need to start turning twitter on it’s head. We should rise up &amp; give all the lefties and Labour cronies a run for their money on here. It’s about pushing a positive message out, defending our history &amp; defeating the lefty media lies &amp; misleading stories.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGov The UK is pretty much leading the way on this, and have massively reduced carbon emissions. The public just aren’t informed enough on it, becuase all they see is the likes of extinction rebellion complaining.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allisonpearson @Robbo1992x As you know Alison, this wasn’t a prediction, but an example of what *could* happen if NO RESTRICTIONS were in place. As you also know, restrictions HAVE been put in place, therefore, it will never come true. The Government would never have let it happen, so what’s your point?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Holbornlolz Rumours from remainers and the EU more like, very fishy all these rumours suddenly coming about now. It ain’t happening. Boris knows what side his bread is buttered, he’s standing firm and I’m standing with him. 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank god I work from home now, on my phone way too much tweeting about politics and football 🤦🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieRenison @AlStewartOBE @itvnews @RishiSunak Should check facts first before tweeting fake news really though....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How funny #StarmerOut is trending.   Whether you agree with #Brexit or not, Labour tried to block &amp; ignore a legitimate, democratic UK referendum result. The shadow Brexit secretary was @Keir_Starmer, now the leader. Captain Hindsight can’t be trusted to lead this country, ever.  https://t.co/PRF8H0Cv1T<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As if my magic, they’ve now moved it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As much as I prefer @realDonaldTrump over Biden &amp; 🇺🇸 politics is important, can @BBCNews start focusing on THIS country. The UK 🇬🇧  A powerful, energetic, funny, uplifting, relatable &amp; strong plan for the future by PM @BorisJohnson isn’t even top story. Same for Rishi yesterday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@real_conch @CCHQPress @BorisJohnson @Conservatives Boris doesn’t want any kind of lockdown. There are tougher restrictions in place on the advice of experts, to try and stop the pandemic getting to unmanageable levels.  The Government can still crack on with their agenda, and over the next few months, hopefully things can ease up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m still in utter disbelief that she hasn’t resigned. She and the SNP are clearly trying to tough this one out, but she is an MP and she deliberately travelled between Scotland and London knowing she had the virus.   For me, this is a criminal matter. Utterly shameful from her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomhfh Labour and media lies never needed any facts for their narrative or agenda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPJHodges @jo_beckett These policies are purely for covid, to help people, not for the future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did like this line, it’s so true.   @BorisJohnson: I have a message for @UKLabour,  "Uncle sugar, the tax-payer, won't do everything. It is the private sector". #CPC20<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dell_dubya Unfortunately. Nots the media have conveniently forgotten about it. Gutting they are both still in jobs tbh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely brilliant speech by Boris at #CPC20. Loved the humour &amp; uplifting nature of it, but also how he addressed serious matters with such warmth &amp; relatability.   To all my fellow Conservatives, Boris backers &amp; proud patriots, appreciate a follow &amp; retweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The classic &amp; energetic  @BorisJohnson is firmly back. Almost Boris in campaigning mode, rallying the troops. Uplifting &amp; optimistic #BorisJohnson speech, very humorous, relatable, defending British culture and dealing with some serious matters.  Some good swipes at Labour too 👊🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here goes @BorisJohnson on protecting British culture. Hitting back against Labour and the woke!! Yes Boris. 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh I do love @BorisJohnson.   He can add such warmth and humour to so much that he says. He’s so relatable to us normal folk, he can make things real, address what really matters to us but deal with things in a very human way.   A wide ranging and powerful speech by Boris 👌🏼👊🏼  https://t.co/Lv3SR1t4b8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the funniest and most energetic I have seen @BorisJohnson. Absolutely smashing out in his speech.   Perfect amount of jokes, relatable, human, serious about the matters that mean something to people, ambitious, optimistic and just generally wanting to bring about change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thescrotie @mt314159 Hopefully blow Labour away!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The next #London mayor needs to be @ShaunBaileyUK.   The Labour Mayor @SadiqKhan has completely failed London, failed on his promises, failed on TfL, failed on building houses, failed on controlling crime and can’t manage the London economy. Vote him out next year London!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be interesting to see how the media spin the @BorisJohnson speech at Tory conference. Not holding my breathe for any fair coverage, considering how corrupt, biased &amp; misleading they’ve been through covid. I have no doubt Boris will smash it &amp; connect with the voters nonetheless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is just something about @RishiSunak. I feel like things are just much safer in his hands.   We’re going to need him to get through covid. Great addition to the top team of the @Conservatives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great to see he’s fighting fit again. The left, media, Biden and Starmer won’t be happy though.   Did @Keir_Starmer ever end up wishing the president a speedy recovery? Don’t think he did. That’s not leadership.  So glad we have @BorisJohnson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pauline93057750 @BorisJohnson @realDonaldTrump And we detest them. Honestly, I can’t watch anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Morning twitter world!!  Hope everyone is doing well!   To all my fellow Conservatives out there, let’s hope Boris smashes his speech later.   Would appreciate a follow and a retweet folks 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The lords need to be abolished. Waste of time. Unelected peers can NOT override democratically elected representatives in the house of commons.  It will go back and come back again, until it’s passed. The end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears @EssexPR @EstherMcVey1 Not being able to mingle is the worst. It’s like we have to be non sociable people 😂  I can imagine trying to get you to stop dancing is a challenge after a drink haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lrihendry What one?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears @EssexPR @EstherMcVey1 😂 Not good for the economy! Haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears @EssexPR @EstherMcVey1 I know, I can’t imagine being a student right now. I used to go out 6 times a week, and didn’t leave to go out until 10/11 partying. I’m just trying to be positive and get everyone to make the best of the situation. Too many are not even going out to pubs, at least we still can.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears @EssexPR @EstherMcVey1 I know how it works Josh, I do nights out too &amp; I partied hard at uni. My point is, some can go out more, some are choosing to stay in because of the curbs. If more people go out earlier, hopefully that makes up some of the loss. I love a day sess watching footie. Positive vibes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears @EssexPR @EstherMcVey1 Well plenty can, at least at some point in the week anyway. All gotta make the best of a bad situation. Plus, when I was at uni, I was always out. After work no problem. Weekends for the football? You got it.  We just gotta adapt for now. Make the situation work, stay positive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR @EstherMcVey1 I really hope all pubs, bars and restaurants bounce back. It’s sad that the 10pm closing has put so many off going. Just start earlier folks! Pubs really do build a community<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @RishiSunak @GMB Don’t take the bait<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As much as I hate that @BorisJohnson gets the blame for literally everything that goes wrong in the world, I kind of love the fact he really gets under the skin of so many lefties and the media.   He’s got the left worried, the remainers trembling and he’s coming for the woke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think I might be crossing to the dark side, but I’m really starting to like @realDonaldTrump. Whatever it is, it’s clear he’s better than Biden.  When it comes to the UK, we can do much better trade deals with America, with Trump at the helm.   🇬🇧 🇺🇸 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @GMB You banned them. Or have you forgotten?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Literally had enough of Labour, no point to them.   They attack for attack sake.   They claim ideas were theirs, after the Tories have already announced them.   They say they were against things, only if it suddenly transpires that the public don’t agree.   Labour are a disgrace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Louise_katz @EssexPR Then they lose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well @NicolaSturgeon did a bloody awful job. Not long ago she was crowing about ridding covid of Scotland, now she’s the worst country of the UK, followed by Wales.    @BorisJohnson doing the best of all the leaders. You won’t here that from the media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR For this to come true, labour would have to vote against the 10pm curfew. The majority of their supporters want it. They might do it for Government defeat, but that could fuck them later. If cases shoot up, the Tories can blame Labour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shock.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RossNorth5 @RJScarfe83 @EssexPR No, but I doubt somebody would stand in for me to make sure it was a ‘positive’ appointment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iromg @MattHancock Transition<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She has to go. Immediately. She travelled in public, knowing she had the virus. SNP won’t expel her tho.... says it all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cumbrian_LUFC30 @EssexPR @RJScarfe83 Hmmmm 🤔 Ok, but in that case, there is no test result to scan into the system. Even if it was scanned in by fluke, it would be more likely to say negative. Once you a sow a seed on here, twitter goes off peddling all kinds of nonsense. Maybe it’s those pesky 5G masts...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cumbrian_LUFC30 @EssexPR @RJScarfe83 Hmmmm 🤔 Ok, but in that case, there is no test result to scan into the system. Even if it was scanned in by fluke, it would be more likely to say negative. Once you a sow a seed on here, twitter goes off peddling all kinds of nonsense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR Well a couple of things here. 1️⃣ If they didn’t book a test, the system wouldn’t have their details (full name, DOB, email, phone number etc). 2️⃣ If they did book a test, but didn’t end up taking it, why they wasting test slots? 3️⃣ Test results are bar code scanned to bookings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RJScarfe83 @EssexPR So why are they booking tests, but then not taking them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR Now you’re peddling conspiracy theories. If they didn’t take a test, how would the test and trace system have their details. You have to give full name, DOB, email, telephone etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickeardleybbc Blame the SNP!!!! And she’s still not resigned. Completely and utterly unacceptable Margaret Ferrier is still an MP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ghost_wales 😂 Keep going. Frustrating tho. I had friends messaging me from Wales stating they hated the Tories for locking all the boroughs down in Wales. I was like....🤯😫😤🤬 it’s Labour!! Cant make it up. I’ve also had people saying Labour done a wonderful job with the furlough 🙄🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ghost_wales You’re wasting your breath. People can’t understand. If something goes right in Wales, it’s the welsh Government, if something goes bad, it’s Boris and the Tories. You can’t make it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Considering that the average covid cases per 100k in Wales is higher than in England, I think this is a bit ridiculous. Impossible to police as well. Around 80% of Wales is currently locked down anyway...  Do Labour want to destroy everything in Wales, or is it just most things?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hate the media lefty bias? Stand up, follow each other, spread the truth. 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon @guardian The most toxic air is what comes out of your mouth. Try doing your job as Mayor of London, a few tweets and blaming the Government for everything, isn’t good enough.  The sooner #London elects a Conservative Mayor, the better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DREAM TEAM! 👌🏼👊🏼  @BorisJohnson &amp; @RishiSunak  https://t.co/6YJ33ssaKK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do love a bit of @RishiSunak. Excellent @Conservatives chancellor. Perfect team up with @BorisJohnson as PM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmmmmm 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see that SNP @MargaretFerrier hasn’t resigned yet.  She’s had the weekend to reflect on her disgusting behaviour of knowingly spreading the virus, yet she is more interested in keeping her job &amp; MP salary, than doing the right thing.  SNP need to expel her. Absolute disgrace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmilyThornberry @SkyNews Another Labour lefty trying to dig the boot into Britain again. Give it a rest &amp; go have dinner with Corbyn or something.  It’s a good thing that shields for the USA Police force are British made. Shows we’re trading outside of Europe &amp; good quality British goods are being made.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>💯   I’m absolutely sick of all the vile, destructive, virtue signalling, mob like lefties in this country. Constant put downs of Britain, our history &amp; culture has got to stop.   We are British, we should be proud of our history &amp; values. Follow, stand tall, &amp; fight back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is your point? Other than it’s good that British products are being used around the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see that Labour are out of the gates blaming Government for it again. Always the blame game with them.   It’s not ideal, but IT technical issues happen. It’s one of those things unfortunately with technology, it sometimes goes wrong. It’s been fixed. Move on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think this American election is going to be absolutely electric in the final couple of weeks. Hold on to your seats folks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jo_beckett Seems in top form from latest video. I think he’ll be out soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hear there could be wider full lockdowns in France, and they have them in Spain too.   Let’s be grateful we have our pubs and bars until 10pm. Let’s make sure we use them. They need our support.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iromg @talkRADIO No Margaret Ferrier? Biggest plank going. She needs to be on next weeks list! Criminal not to be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is false. Even though the cases weren’t announced at the time, it’s been confirmed that test and trace still went ahead as normal. More #FakeNews 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still gives me goosebumps today. Such an amazing moment and always worth a watch when you need cheering up. This is definitely one of the better 10pm moments...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gnscloz @EssexPR Deaths thankfully won’t be anywhere near the spring. Main reason being the majority of cases are in the young this time, and the other being there are now drugs to help prevent deaths from happening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About time somebody took the SNP on. They’ve been getting away with far too much lately, with next to no scrutiny. The final straw was an SNP covid positive MP deliberately mixing with the public when she knew she had the virus.   Keep up the good work @Douglas4Moray.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. @realDonaldTrump seems to be doing really well, almost completely back to normal. Good to see he’s recovering so quickly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR It’s not from nowhere though is it, it’s the last week. So the 7 day rolling average is much higher than we thought. That won’t suit the agenda of the people who were saying it wasn’t going up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even though these aren’t all in the last 24hrs, it means each day over the last week, there have been many more cases than we thought.   We simply can’t disregard them, just because they are not the last 24hrs. The rolling 7 day average is clearly much higher than we thought.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@ManUtd: “I can’t believe we’ve had the heaviest defeat of the weekend.” @LFC: “Hold my beer”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BritishAlba @SkyNews Takes time to radically change the system. At least it’s coming under this Tory Government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@francisobrienUK 💯  Was hoping for the same in the Spurs Game. Save that for Arsenal 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ncopestick1 @BorisJohnson @BBCPolitics Mostly Brexit I think, but also the fact he’s not the stereotypical politician.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Liverpool getting absolutely thrashed. Can’t believe how many goals we’ve had today. Good day for football, not so much for Manchester and Liverpool though 😂 #AVLIV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottBentonMP @LondonMarathon @Conservatives Well done mate, great effort!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mikey1732 @Streakyblue1951 Devastating<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lathamphil1 @BorisJohnson That too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR Decisions arnt taken on a day or two of positive cases, it’s on a rolling average. Therefore, if cases wernt announced by accident for positive cases 5 days ago and are now, it’s still part of the same rolling average.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RightOh1995 @UKLabour Bit unfair to put a brilliant bacon sandwich in the mix of those serial incompetent Labour MPs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just seen the full @BorisJohnson  interview on #Marr. Good performance by Boris, especially under the most ridiculous &amp; rushed interviewer style. Marr wasn’t even listening to the answers, just interrupting &amp; quickly moving on to the next. Media are just in full anti Boris mode.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amazing game. Well done @SpursOfficial!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🔥 🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🔥 This man is on fire this season!!! Man United getting absolutely smashed today! #MUNTOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad that Trump is doing well. His doc just said he could be out of hospital as early as tomorrow. Back on the campaign trail hopefully very very soon. Was shocked to see the headline on @BBCNews stating he was going to be in hospital for days, What is with the BBC and #FakeNews.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow! This is an insane start. Come on Spurs!! #MUNTOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a start!! 2 goals in 4 minutes!!! #MUNTOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love them or loathe them, @BorisJohnson 🇬🇧 &amp; @realDonaldTrump 🇺🇸 are two of the most patriotic people out there, very relatable &amp; on the side of the people &amp; what matters to them.   The media hate it. They like to be able to control everything. The media are the enemy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not surprised at all by this.   I expect the UK to continue to drop down &amp; thus it will get absolutely no mention on @BBCNews. The UK is testing more than the rest of Europe, has billions of PPE stockpiled &amp; has plans in place for the winter.   Don’t get brainwashed by the MSM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks @pritipatel. Speed up and the country will be behind you. 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great speech by @pritipatel. Action is needed on illegal immigration. It does take time to put in proper reform of the system, but it needs to speed up.   People are not fleeing conflict or war from the likes of France. Lefty lawyers can’t be allowed to stop deportation.   🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So pleased to hear @BorisJohnson acting in the interests of the UK, not allowing the EU to make the UK a vassal state. Boris is standing up for 🇬🇧, against a very corrupt and threatening EU. He’s stood firm all year and I have no doubt he will continue to do so.  Bring on 31 Dec.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To Labour?! That’s basically the case in Wales, whereby Labour run the Welsh Government, and they’re doing a flaming awful job there. Nothing else to be devolved!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well done for saying what a lot of us ‘non brainwashed’ people already know 👏🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Considering all the things she said over Cummings, it’s astounding that she hasn’t resigned.   What she did was way beyond anything anybody else has done. She travelled when waiting for a test result, visited places, went to Parliament &amp; travelled back after a positive result.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This 👇🏼  The rate of infection is actually higher in SNP Scotland &amp; Labour Wales. @Conservatives will take no lectures from the likes of @NicolaSturgeon &amp; @Keir_Starmer, when they’re facing massive issues themselves. Covid isn’t an easy issue to solve, I stand with @BorisJohnson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This 👇🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedsTheBest23 @Louise_katz The Tories have had to do things cos of covid not normal Tory Government would normally do. But it is what it is. Things will change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@back_badger Some people are being ridiculously over cautious if that’s the case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If tighter restrictions are needed in London, it has to be on a borough by borough basis. There is such variation between areas, it would be unfair to lockdown the whole of #London. Some boroughs barely have any cases, like in Sutton and so a London wide lockdown would be unjust.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really do believe @BorisJohnson loves doing stuff like this. Such a great people’s PM. Full support to this man, who’s battling on so many fronts, with a corrupt media to boot.  Keep up the good work Boris, keep firm on #Brexit and make sure British culture is protected. 🇬🇧 🇬🇧  https://t.co/IPXz8q5uIh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sadie05564690 They’ve still happened. All the people saying cases had not been going up the last few days was clearly wrong.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sod the democrats and Labour, #PrayForTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope Trump gets better mega quick. He needs to come back fighting!! Come on @realDonaldTrump, we’re with you. #PrayForTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxxysTweets They said this about Boris. And at the same time Biden is making broadcasts.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From what I’ve seen, Biden is trying to exploit the fact Trump has coronavirus &amp; didn’t wear a mask very often. The left really do try to exploit the virus don’t they. Labour and the Democrats are very similar in the fact that they see this as a good crisis to exploit.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears Taste of her cherry chapstick?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears And you liked it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NOTHING<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCNews It’s not a ‘possible’ breach is it. It’s damn right criminal travelling when you know you have covid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR I get what you’re trying to say, BUT, if the Government hadn’t brought in so many tight restrictions up north over the past month, as well as the rule of 6 over 2 weeks ago, then this chart would look very different. Remember, this ‘example’ was if the Government did nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clearly not much social distancing going on then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s very telling how @Keir_Starmer wants to be PM of the UK, yet he can’t even wish the president of the USA @realDonaldTrump a speedy recovery. Absolutely nothing from him.   I can only imagine he doesn’t want to offend all his lefty supporters. That’s not leadership.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can’t wait!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robbie_ws Like comparing a banana to a window. Completely different cases and you know it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@DavidGHFrost: On fisheries the gap between 🇬🇧 &amp; 🇪🇺 is unfortunately very large and, without further realism and flexibility from the EU, risks being impossible to bridge.  These issues are fundamental to our future status as an independent country.  @BorisJohnson holding firm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lc5190 Wow. Not sure why you can’t get your head around this, but all the restrictions brought in over the past month or so was to prevent deaths EVER getting to the levels shows in the press conference. So your tweet is absolute rubbish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I bet the SNP are secretly glad of bigger news re.Trump taking over the top headlines &amp; airtime  Be in no doubt, SNP still have many questions to answer. Why they did not react straight away? An SNP MP travelling via public transport when they knew they had covid is unforgivable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MartinDavisMC1 Fuck all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jack43872427 @EllieMellie1 @LeonaRoberts12 I’m thinking more with behaviours and the rules....just a consideration.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even if we agree that restrictions need to be in place atm, including work from home, this is incredibly sad to see in our capital city. #London is a great city and the sooner it is back to life, the better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomhfh @carolecadwalla Based on this, if the same thing happened in America, Trump has a problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@owainbeynon It’s not even that, if you look into the facts. But it is a scary image. If people are following the 2m rule &amp; all other restrictions, what does density matter, unless you are not socially distancing. Clearly a lot of people are not, map suggests it is more labour leaning voters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@owainbeynon That is not population correlation at all. The south east is heavily populated and more than South Wales. Also, I’m thinking it’s more of the mindset of voters and likelihood of breaking the rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bollocks. SNP trying to cover it up. They didn’t even suspend her until uproar on social media.   Tells you all you need to know about the SNP. Willingly spreading a deadly virus to London and then back again on public transport. The fact she has not resigned is baffling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Leadership is not just putting a tweet out condemning it, leadership would be to act immediately (which she didn’t do) and making her stand down. Taking the whip away isn’t enough. She put countless lives at risk by travelling from Scotland to London and back with Covid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anybody actually watch #bbcqt anymore? I see it trending, but whenever I watch it, it’s just the same old shit. Presenter constantly interrupting the Conservative MP, anti Brexit, anti Government guests, constant Boris bashing and factually misleading information.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought the Mirror was big on covid rule breaking?! Or does Corbyn breaking the rule of 6 and an SNP MP testing positive and then travelling on public transport, not count? If it was a Conservative MP, it would be splashed all over the front page by @PippaCrerar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun If people in Italy can keep going, so can we.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IainMcGill @NicolaSturgeon She brought it from Scotland to England. Furious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SiobhanBenita You’re completely delusional. They are completely different. Cummings didn’t travel after a positive test, he didn’t mix with other people on Parliament, he didn’t go to work, he didn’t go on public transport.  He travelled in a car with his family and went nowhere near anybody.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OzKaterji There are many cities in England, not sure of your point? If you look at the Labour band across South Wales, that’s not relating to cities or population. It’s more to do with how people some vote and their attitude to following the rules. Obvs it’s not uniform, but a general obs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mackay52 @bbclaurak If you even think the two cases are similar , you’re deluded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let’s not forget she brought Covid to London from Scotland in the first place, while she waited for a test.   She needs to go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chasmanu @RuthDavidsonMSP In a car, without testing positive, without coming into contact with others. Bit different, wouldn’t you say? She knew she had it and still travelled on public transport.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Margaret Ferrier should face disciplinary action for her recklessness. You do not travel the length of the UK when waiting for a test result, let alone AFTER testing positive. She has put passengers, rail staff, MPs and many others at risk.   Absolutely astonishing. Resign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbclaurak Bit more than oops. Spreading it all over the country potentially. Travelling the length of the UK when you are waiting on test results and then travelling again on a train when you know you have the disease, isn’t just stupid, it’s damn right unacceptable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can’t get my head around it.   SNP MP travels the whole way from Scotland to London, whilst waiting for test results on whether she has covid. Potentially then infecting many on the train and in Parliament.   She then travels again, AFTER finding out she has coronavirus 🤯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulfranks @MrHarryCole She’s been travelling with coronavirus, whilst waiting for the result and AFTER receiving a positive case. He didn’t. If you can’t see what a massive difference this is, you’re not all there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So SNP bringing coronavirus to London, and travelling while waiting for test result.   Absolutely disgusting behaviour.   Any comment @NicolaSturgeon? or are you going to remain silent like @Keir_Starmer on Corbyn breaking the rules too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EamonnPostle That’s it, all those cities in the Welsh valleys and town.  All those people living closer than 2m to each other. Nothing to do with behaviour of how people vote and the following the rules 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LadyStras Live closer together? If you stick to the rules of 2m, then I’m sorry, but that’s bull.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>7-day case rate per 100,000 people in the UK👇  Conservative run England: 63.2  SNP run Scotland: 68.5  DUP run Northern Ireland: 122.7  Labour run Wales: 78.8  If you think Labour/Starmer would do better than @Conservatives &amp; @BorisJohnson, think again.

<|startoftext|>The predicted Q3 growth figure for GDP in the three months to September 30, is tipped to be a huge record, with economists’ forecasts showing the UK likely to move to the top of the G7 performance table. Economy is bouncing back in a V shape recovery. Don’t be fooled by the media<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adam1310uk @LucasMitte Did I say that? No. Stop making stuff up, you just look stupid.  What the maps shows, is that generally, if a constituency tends to lean to Labour, it seems to have more chance of rule breakers and covid spikes. As I said in Wales, the more staunch Labour areas, are the hot spots<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGov Yet the economy has been growing at a fast pace the last 3 months. When the GDP figures for Q3 come our next month, I expect a huge growth figure. Just shows the media have scared people and are causing anxiety unnecessarily<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucasMitte Take for example wales. In South Wales, the Labour areas are the areas that have spiralling cases. Labour are in charge in Wales for Covid, but my point is where the areas lead towards voting Labour, is where the rules are clearly being broken.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucasMitte You’re missing the point. It clearly shows that’s there’s a link between how people vote and how much the follow the rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any further bailout (again!) should be on the basis that @SadiqKhan having failed in his role as Mayor, should step down with immediate effect.   The Labour Mayor for #London has been a complete walking disaster, spending all his time blaming central Government for his failures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 The rule of six has been in over 2 weeks, as has other tightened restrictions in the north. Those have clearly flattened the start of the exponential growth, that clearly did start, if you actually look at the graphs. The point of these restrictions was to stop the growth.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@petertheblade The whole point of getting a test is to see whether you have covid and can self isolate  and your contacts be checked.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RussellGoodeno1 Errr, yea, they are, hence the test! 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Put a sock in it. The only thing cooked up, is this tired old NHS lie of yours Corbyn.  Labour push the same lies out, time &amp; time again.

<|startoftext|>@Cassthestafff The South Wales valleys do not have a significant BAME community, yet covid has gone through the roof there. Weirdly and thought provoking, these are Labour areas too. There must therefore be a link, whereby Labour leaning voters are less likely to follow the rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👀👀 shots fired<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour let it slip here, but be in no doubt, every Labour MP incl Starmer have been using the pandemic to attack the @Conservatives. They’re now attacking @RishiSunak.

<|startoftext|>Wow. Could Labour sink any lower?  Any rise in unemployment will be down to the pandemic that is coronavirus.

<|startoftext|>Labour have locked down the whole of South Wales, and are now locking down North Wales.   That’s nearly the whole population of Wales in ‘local’ lockdowns and unable to mix with other households.   Labour have completely and utterly failed.

<|startoftext|>Welsh Labour Government lock down 60% of the welsh population, preventing different households mixing - amazing, Labour really care about saving lives.

<|startoftext|>@toadmeister Do remember that It’s labour in power in Wales and they’ve locked down the majority of the population unnecessary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPJHodges It depends what we mean by ‘lockdown’. Another national lockdown whereby everything is closed, is not going to work for anybody. Tighter restrictions in certain areas, with things still open, can work. It has to be measure and proportionate to the infection rate though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK And they’re still open, what’s the point?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DebbieE46116279 I don’t really agree with the 10pm thing, I think it’s unfair on business but I believe the government is trying to protect lives.

<|startoftext|>@chris48163264 @thedsggroup Ok, so why do you think they are doing all this? What have they got to benefit from it? Considering you say you’ll never vote Tory again, then why would they risk losing all those supporters? For what?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chris48163264 @thedsggroup During a pandemic, it’s not about Tory or Labour, it’s about controlling the virus. Period. You don’t know what the evidence is do you, unless you work in Government. At the end of the day, it is what it is. I don’t like it either, but I’m not going to throw my toys out the pram<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chris48163264 @thedsggroup Why would it happen if cases stay low?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chris48163264 @thedsggroup But they haven’t been instructed by the NHS to self isolate, that’s the point. So no Tory policy forcing them inside. It’s a uni/labour council decision to make them stay in their halls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chris48163264 @thedsggroup It’s temporary during a flaming pandemic. Any UK government would have done the same in this situation. Once the pandemic is over, we get to go back to normal, with a full working Tory Government. Even while this is happening Boris is still dealing with Brexit etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chris48163264 @thedsggroup Couldn’t be worse? So you don’t think a second national lockdown would be worse? Really?!? I think you’d moan if there was one, so things could be worse and that’s what labour would be like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chris48163264 @thedsggroup What Tory policy meant they were locked in their rooms? That was a uni and labour council decision. NOT Tory! Lost credibility now you’re lying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chris48163264 @thedsggroup The fact you would consider voting Labour, when you know they couldn’t manage the economy and you’d have even less liberties under them, and as I said, you’d still be in lockdown with them, kinda makes no sense. All the things you hate right now, you’d have worse with Labour 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chris48163264 @thedsggroup A Labour Government would have been far worse, we’d probably still all be in lockdown. Just look at wales.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chris48163264 @thedsggroup We’re in the middle of a flaming pandemic, so yes josh have been lost right now, and debt has spiralled as they’ve had to pay people’s wages, and had to do restrictions to Tory Government would normally do.

<|startoftext|>@thedsggroup @chris48163264 I know it’s not going to be easy, the economy is going to need bounce back, but it’s only the Conservatives that can do that. I believe people will see that the money spent during covid was needed, and there is no way Labour can be trusted to get that down and manage the economy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 As much as I often agree with you @JuliaHB1, the Government have been introducing tougher local restrictions all the time over the last month or so, as well as rule of 6 2 weeks ago. Those will have all had an impact on lowering cases.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who’s going to win then folks? Will it be the man that is Donald Trump, or the man with 180 years in the Senate....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thedsggroup Destroyed the Tories? They’re still leading most polls and that’s in middle of a pandemic that is taking all their time up.

<|startoftext|>@ste942000 They’d be going up quicker without them. But if they are still rising, shows a lot not complying.  That’s graph was worst case if nobody followed the rules. If people do, it will never be as bad. It’s not rocket science.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden is just awful.   Every interview is just terrible 🤦🏼‍♂️  You’d think that with 180 years in the Senate, he’d be more experienced 🤷🏼‍♂️👀🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Couldn’t agree more with @EstherMcVey1 here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Casawoo @MahyarTousi There have been constant restrictions being brought in over the last month or so. So it’s not just one thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shocked by how dense some are being with this graph.  Government have been constantly bringing in tighter restrictions for the past month or so to AVOID this coming true. If it all goes to plan, it will never become true. It would only come true if majority didn’t abide by rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sutty56 @Louise_katz @MattHancock @BorisJohnson Exactly, that will be feeding into the numbers too. Yet some ppl think they’ve magically gone down 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think we can all agree, covid isn’t good for anybody. The economy is so important to everyone’s health and the sooner things can get back to normal the better. Problem is, we will never know what restrictions work and what ones don’t. Brexit chatter on twitter was far easier...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agw1437 @rodbishop15 I agree, we just don’t know what’s working and what’s not. That’s an issue. I don’t want this 10pm curfew in any longer than it has to be. If it’s not effective, it needs to go. But I don’t know how they will measure it’s effectiveness when so many other restrictions in play<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rodbishop15 I want the economy open as much as the next person believe me. I just don’t want Boris crucified by the media if suddenly cases shoot up and people lose their lives. Has to be some balance. Lots of EU countries are having huge spikes in hospitals etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SJJB55 @EssexPR @JuliaHB1 Didn’t say that. Some people not showing symptoms could be contacts of some people with. Impossible to say. With so many diff restrictions in place all over the UK, there’s no way to say what is working and what isn’t. The 10pm curfew could be pointless, but we won’t really know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR @SJJB55 @JuliaHB1 The rule of 6 therefore could have already prevented thousands of new cases as it came in around 2 weeks ago.Those people infected then,would now be getting tests done, but are not, due to that restriction. It’s impossible to know exactly what’s working, but cases are going down<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR @SJJB55 @JuliaHB1 Rule of 6 came in around 2 weeks ago and new local restrictions have been coming in nearly daily somewhere in the UK over the last month or so. It only takes a week to start filtering through as that is generally when people start showing symptoms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SJJB55 @JuliaHB1 So we never needed to do anything then, cases would have naturally always gone down and all other countries around us gone up. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SJJB55 @JuliaHB1 Whatever you think of them, the fact cases have come down, shows they are working. Cases would not naturally come down otherwise and you know that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SJJB55 @JuliaHB1 Because you can’t look at facts? If you bring in a restriction, it will start having an effect a week or so later. Oh, and it just so happens to be when cases are flattening. But you think their flattening for no reason?i think your not engaging your brain 2bh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SJJB55 @JuliaHB1 Exactly. That will no doubt be having a massive effect after 14 days considering ppl show symptoms generally between 7 and 14 days. If you look at the population of over 60m, it would be quite a big impact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itvpeston Lefty media being able to brainwash ppl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SJJB55 @JuliaHB1 You will never know exactly, but the rule of 6 will be filtering through now, as will other tighter restrictions in diff areas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 The whole point of restrictions is to make sure this doesn’t happen. That’s the point.  If cases flatten, they are working.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glasterlaw1 @theSNP @NicolaSturgeon Why are so many others so brainwashed then? Is she casting a spell on TV every night or something?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Glasgow in Scotland has the highest rate of covid in the UK, Scotland’s hospital admissions are going up the fastest, it had the highest proportion of covid deaths from care-homes in UK, @theSNP Government banned students going out and yet Scotland love @NicolaSturgeon. Hmm 🤷🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iromg Boris needs to do a big speech on this and all the things he’s bringing in to defeat the woke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Louise_katz @sutty56 @MattHancock @BorisJohnson The rule of 6 was 2 weeks ago. So that would be filtering through now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Louise_katz @MattHancock @BorisJohnson You do realise that the whole aim of the restrictions was to make sure that this example never came true. This example was based on the Government doing nothing. The rule of 6 was brought in &amp; will be starting to bring cases down now, so it shows the restrictions are working<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GuidoFawkes Fake News! Decision was taken last Thursday, when the restrictions first came in. So no u-turn whatsoever.  https://t.co/d0aZMfInoG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what annoys me. The Government gets the blame for something, that isn’t even true. What also intrigues me, is why so many Tory/Boris supporters are now so quick to slag the Goverment off these days. It’s like they see an opportunity to gain some attention and likes. Sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisMasonViews @1983Jackhancock Yes, but they had already stopped serving alcohol last Thursday, when all other pubs and bars did. Hence why the story is wrong and isn’t accurate. It would only be a u-turn if they had carried in serving alcohol until today, not in line with other pubs, but that isn’t true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@igiveup326 @rodbishop15 You are right Phoebe. The idea of the restrictions was that the example graph never came true. Yet people now saying the graph ain’t coming true, so they were wrong. 🙈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The job of Goverment is to make sure the doomsday example figures (below) don’t come true.   If they materialised, then everything that is being done in regards to restrictions would be failing. If they aren’t coming true so far (good thing!) then the restrictions are working.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rodbishop15 Wasn’t this an example of no restrictions enforced? The results of the rule of 6 coming in will be starting to show now, and could explain cases going down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisMasonViews @1983Jackhancock No, actually. The decision was made when the restrictions were first brought in. So today was all fake news.  https://t.co/nNk8Zd9KFE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnyboy2021 @EssexPR Not everyone is no, but a lot of people are yes. Not everyone is completely irresponsible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Taken same time as opinium. Which is accurate? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR I expect it is to do with the rule of 6 though. That came in a couple of weeks ago now, so clearly having an impact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, they keep electing a Labour MP. That’s the problem....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1983Jackhancock @ChrisMasonViews You do realise that the House if Commons bar as you put it has not served alcohol since the 10pm curfew came in last Thursday. So what part is it being a ‘bar’?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Twitter isn’t real life 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can any Labour MP in that seat not get in trouble?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can it be a u-turn?!? I really would like somebody to explain what exactly was the u-turn part, considering Parliament stopped serving alcohol at 10, like every other pub. Anyone?! Complete Fake News that it’s #oneruleforthem. Not even anything to do with @Conservatives  https://t.co/pNJ7berO9D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is it a u-turn, if no alcohol has been served in Parliament passed 10pm since the restrictions came in on Thursday?!   The decision was made on Thursday that no alcohol would be served and it hasn’t. So if parliament has u-turned, so has every pub and bar in the UK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackyCwiero But yet it’s no different to any pub or bar right now, none have served alcohol passed 10, so how is it a u turn. It’s ridiculous. It’s fake news stories after fake news story these days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ga1863 Except no alcohol has been served there since the new restrictions came in on Thursday. So what is your point exactly? Apart from it being fake news<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeHester88 @EssexPR But no alcohol has been served since the restrictions came in. A decision was taken on Thursday, but only now filtering though after half a day of fake news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR But they haven’t served alcohol since Thursday... Parliamentary Authorities said no alcohol had been served on the Parliamentary estate since the guidelines came in on Thursday. Monday would be the first day that it would take practical effect, with the Commons to sit after 10.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What I’m shocked by these days is the amount of ‘Conservative’ supporters who are so quick to spread fake news on twitter, just to get some likes and attention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage It said no alcohol had been served on the Parliamentary estate since the guidelines came in, after a decision on Thursday. But that Monday would be the first day that it would take practical effect, with the Commons likely to sit after 10pm. So where’s the u- turn?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So what is all this u-turn talk about today? Nothing has changed. It was never serving alcohol since the 10pm curfew came in. It’s just been fake news all day then 🙄  Just another chance for the left media and lefty trolls on twitter to spread #oneruleforthem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The parliamentary authorities have said: No alcohol had been served on the Parliamentary estate since the guidelines came in, after a decision on Thursday. Monday would be the first day that it would take practical effect, with the Commons likely to sit after 10pm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarrySheerman Says Labour, who in a modern democracy, tried to cancel the democratic will of the people and cancel Brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty much everything Labour say is fake news - getting tiring now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR @RishiSunak Genuine question, do you really think that Boris wants to impose these restrictions? Yes, I agree some decisions seem a bit wonky in why they’re doing them, but Boris is under pressure to follow his medical and scientific experts. He’s already pushed back on a second lockdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrolleyRyan @KayBurley @DesmondSwayne Your whole tweet was about MASKS!!!!!! You were spouting crap about not wearing masks. You don’t have to wear masks in office workplaces. The Houses of Parliament is classed as....office workplace, hence nobody wearing masks. So your point on masks (the whole tweet) was false.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Do keep up! It wasn’t a Government decision, an error was made by the ones who run the House of Commons by classing them as workplace canteens. Government pressured them to act, they now can’t serve alcohol passed 10.  I know you like attention but your spouting out of date info<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tujeshynroman @MrHarryCole Was never a Government or Tory decision. It was the ones who run the House of Commons, sticking to the rules of what they thought was a workplace canteen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And it was never a @Conservatives or Government decision to keep them open. Why is everyone so quick to jump on Boris’s back before knowing the facts 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Note the original decision was never that of the Conservatives or Government, it was the House of Commons. Yet as usual, the Conservatives get the blame for independent decision. Glad they pressured tho!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dominiquetaegon Except it’s not correct is it. Bars can’t serve alcohol passed 10pm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrolleyRyan @KayBurley @DesmondSwayne It’s a work place, you don’t have to wear them in offices either. Are you that dim?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetroMayorSteve It’s not MPs or Government that control this btw.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>⛔️ Confirmed: no outlet in Parliament will be selling alcohol after 10pm.   MPs &amp; staff will quite rightly be subject to the same rules as everyone else.  Worth noting that Government doesn't control those kinds of rules in the Commons, it’s independent.   So not #OneRuleForThem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a massive failure of the Welsh Labour Government.   Labour have been too busy attacking the UK Government, they’ve forgotten about how they are meant to be managing the situation in Wales.   Utter shambles, but yet Labour don’t get scrutinised.  https://t.co/B1THJD5lTk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acgrayling Give up losers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who’s bored of these losers?   @BorisJohnson, sink these nutters by 31 December. 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this the next EU threat? 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh how I miss this already. 🍑  https://t.co/MRxFU6qws8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaB2328 @rentonMagaUK @ghost_wales Any Government would be doing what they are doing now in terms of restrictions, a Labour Government would be worse in terms of restrictions, just look at wales. Be in no doubt, so much going on behind the scenes on defending our culture, getting Brexit over the transition period<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ghost_wales Nah, I’m with you. People just can’t hold their nerve through covid, even tho any leader would have to make the same decisions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryRiddell On their way out? 😂 you’d love that, but unfortunately for you, they ain’t even started yet. Covid has got in the way, but they have so many plans against the woke, lefty elite and Brexit blockers. So@much levelling up to do as well. I’d grab the popcorn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody on my Facebook who lives in Barry, Wales wrote this status after it was revealed the area would go into lockdown👇🏼  A rubbish situation, but why the hell is @BorisJohnson getting the blame for a Welsh Labour Government decision? Same goes for SNP decisions in Scotland.  https://t.co/N0nEhZb4rM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’d flee Scotland with the SNP in power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zarahsultana Further education is a choice. Somebody has to pay for it and it wouldn’t be fair for others to fund it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayDouglas9 @Conservatives Point is, Labour need to stop lying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just realised, nearly all the problematic areas for either covid or people breaching the rules are in Labour Council areas. Toughest restrictions in Labour areas of England or Wales. Crowds in the streets in Labour Liverpool. Students being locked in halls by Manchester Labour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*BREAKING* #RT  @Conservatives: “There are no plans to keep students at uni over Christmas &amp; Labour are deliberately creating unnecessary stress for young people to score political points.”  Labour are always trying to exploit a situation with lies to further their own agenda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly nailed it 👇🏼 Students that have been locked down in Manchester is NOTHING to do with the @Conservatives. People need to start engaging their brains.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vardy on fire!! 🔥 #MCILEI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR @TheOwlHighBeach 😋 🤤 making me hungry....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@Conservatives and Boris starting to get tougher on the culture war. Be in no doubt, these things have been planned. Nothing is quick and easy these days and covid has got in the way and delayed stuff.  Keep the faith with @BorisJohnson. 🇬🇧 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sherelle_E_J They’ve already started. Appointments to BBC and Ofcom, potentially taking away funding if statues are removed etc. Things take time sometimes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think Boris needs to get more aggressive in the political stakes against Labour. He’s being very health conscious &amp; giving polite public messages, while Labour are allowed to throw political attacks. @BorisJohnson, you can’t let Labour get away with scaremongering and lying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is not a penalty. Absolute disgrace! #TOTNEW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears It’s not that, it’s frustrating because I feel the Tories are getting so much flack, when whatever they did, they’d get it from some side. Then there’s Labour brainwashing ppl that they are so good, woudl be so much better, and then you look at Wales and it’s tougher restrictions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears Labour say what they want you to hear. They say diff things, to diff groups, just like they did with Brexit. They only care about power, but they’ve brainwashed you. Easy to attack Tories, not so easy being in Gov. They are in Wales &amp; they do the opp to what they say in England<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour need to explain why they have locked down the majority of Wales, yet in England they say any increase in cases is a failure of Government.   Last time I checked, the Government  in Wales was a Labour one and therefore on that logic, Labour have failed Wales. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is there anywhere left that isn’t completely locked down in the Labour controlled South Wales? But....those nasty Tories imposing restrictions are the worst. *looks at Wales*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears I admit it’s shit. Im not exactly having a great time either. I moved to London for London life and not getting it. Ive cancelled a house warming, not going to birthday parties etc. I’m following the rules to avoid a full lockdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears My point is, they say different things to diff people. Where they are in power in Wales they are saying students might not go home for Xmas. They’d do same if in power in England. They lie to buy votes, as no way to prove otherwise. If your trust what they say, you’ve lost it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears Labour in Wales are saying the opposite, saying they might stop students going home for Christmas. Labour will say anything for some votes and do the opposite where they have power. Thing is, people see tons of students in the street partying with no social distancing....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears But it’s not the Conservative Government, so why are you blaming them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DehennaDavison I wouldn’t go that far. It’s often very left wing and normally not reflective of fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears Your blaming the Government for specific unis telling students not to go to bars and pubs. It’s not policy, only in Scotland where it’s the SNP in charge. The problems is, unis and councils can take tougher restrictions in individual cases/outbreaks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears The Government have not banned students from leaving their accommodation in England. Yes some are being told to by the uni or council, but that isn’t Government guidelines unless a positive case. If you look at the data, the majority of new cases are people in their 20’s.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears If anything, all the other parties would be tougher on restrictions. They certainly wouldn’t be less restrictive. To say they don’t care about young people is ridiculous. They’ve done everything they can to get people back to school and uni &amp; young ppl arnt being treated worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shane_gladstone The UK government hasn’t locked anybody up. It’s universities and councils that have instructed it. The only person in Government who has said anything is in the Scottish SNP Government, Nicola Sturgeon. Unless you have proof it’s come from Boris? Source please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sokoli_V @DarrenPlymouth Yes, and the police should have stepped in then. My views are the same on all of the protests.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidLammy Your the MP for the area, if nothing is down to you to help, what purpose do you have?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Starmer was Labour Shadow Brexit Secretary. Tried to block brexit at every opportunity and went on marches for a second referendum. Funny how people forget and would now vote for him.  Polls today say nothing for how people will vote in 4 years. 4 days is a long time in politics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcherLord1 Labour would have done the exact same, if not more based on how they’ve been in Wales. So on that logic of yours, the Tory vote share would go down yes, but it shouldn’t go to Labour, who agree with what the Government has done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SunPolitics There were never plans. God I hate the media a press lies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisgower @charliehtweets @BorisJohnson All it will do is create a full lockdown whereby everything is closed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think #BLM need to stand candidates in the next UK elections.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Telegraph I support this in a way, however, this will just split the centre right vote and let Labour in. That will mean the opposite effect to the goals of this movement. Labour are intent on wiping out our history, as you can tell by looking at London with the Mayor and Labour councils.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hopefull68 And I said the same back then, that I did not agree. The Police have to be consistent but they seem scared to stop anything to do with BLM or race.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is a Saturday Night really that different from a Monday or Tuesday night now? Every night is the same, and no night can really flow or be a spontaneous one anymore. It abruptly ends no matter what. This is sad times if this is the next 6 months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LozzaFox @youdonewhat Won’t this help allow a labour Government in the door in a few years? Labour will literally take away all our history, statues etc. A Labour Mayor in London is already threatening to do so and I fear a Labour Government would be the end. Must not let that happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpaJw @BBradley_Mans @jamieoliver Negotiation tactics, but suddenly some members of the public decide they are the ones negotiating and decide the undermine the UK efforts. Oh how that worked so well under Teresa May.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hardlyperennial @EssexPR This is the very puzzling thing. She u-turned on exams, she’s done very tough restrictions, far more than Boris, she has locked down students and yet she is riding very high in the polls. So I can only conclude that people are getting brainwashed by the media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyBurnhamGM Impartial news? We haven’t had that for a while. Constant left wing bullshit, to the point the country is being slowly brainwashed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WindsorBlade76 @DarrenPlymouth It was taken away by the police due to them failing to stick to the conditions of the risk assessment. So what exactly is your point?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrueSayGB @BritainElects @OpiniumResearch Exactly. Based on history, the opposition would gain tons of seats in the local elections etc. It’s like a protest vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BritainElects @OpiniumResearch 3 points after Labours Conference. Hardly mind blowing. After Tory conference it’ll probs be a Tory lead again. Also, we’re in the middle of covid which isn’t helpful and we still have 4 years until next election. Expect a lot to change in that time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adam_Allcroft And it’s just after the Labour conference. We shall see.  Boris has to do health announcements and restrictions people hate, Starmer can just criticise from the sidelines and attack everything. Public should wake up, Labour are not the answer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollypops3109 People like me have got things closed down? Seriously, you are bordering insane now. What exactly am I doing? I’ve pushed for no second lockdown, I’ve pushed for people to go out more, I eat out &amp; drink out all the time, barely stay home. I’ve pushed ppl to get cancer checks etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesEnders @BritainElects A Labour lead then clearly. Nothing else would be mind blowing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollypops3109 Stand up or shut up?! That’s your answer? I AM standing up for what I think. What you mean is stand up if it’s what YOU think, but if it’s not the same view as you, shut up. Arrogant. There is no fucking lockdown, but you’ll get everything closed. There are rules and restrictions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andywynn15 @Hollypops3109 I didn’t say it was easy or anything is ideal right now. It’s sad times. I hope they are ok and things get better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andywynn15 @Hollypops3109 They arnt full lockdowns. You can still go pub etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adam1310uk @BorisJohnson There is already lefty bias now. This should make it fair at last.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisMasonViews @DarrenPlymouth It shouldn’t be. I never agreed with BLM. I don’t buy all that crap anyway. It’s a Marxist political organisation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hollypops3109 😂😂🤣 I stand for quite a lot thanks, but I do not want to be locked down in a second national lockdown all because some want to march around London and stick two fingers up to all covid guidance. Standing for ‘freedom’ I hear, but it will result in the opposite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is brilliant stuff @BorisJohnson! Right wing brexiteers is just what is needed. It’s about time the cosy lefty elite in the broadcasting media were ruffled up. Ofcom has been next to useless the last few years and needs to change radically.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve said before, I don’t agree with the #TrafalgarSquare #Antilockdown protests today. I didn’t agree with the #BLM protests either. The Police were right to shut it down today, as it’s against social distancing rules. BUT they didn’t with BLM, why are rules applied selectively?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarenRe15630147 @DarrenPlymouth They should do, but I haven’t seen it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@denhelder1 Which is wrong, I never agreed with those either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ncfc76 I don’t agree with that either. Police need to be consistent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@unsnatcher @FormerlyKC @DarrenPlymouth You may not like them, but these same rules like masks are all over the world. They are to help save lives and avoid another national lockdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlockCapita Not everything and I don’t believe all scientific models, doom and gloom etc.  However, what I do believe is that Boris doesn’t want to do these rules, and doesn’t want a second national lockdown. But if ppl keep breaking the rules, he’ll be pushed into it by the health experts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlockCapita A stand? The only thing these protests will do is force us into another lockdown. They won’t do fuck all else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@unsnatcher @FormerlyKC @DarrenPlymouth What constitutes an evil rule then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sotacor @DarrenPlymouth I don’t think the police are a strict against BLM protests no, and they should be. They seem to be weak against BLM, probably for fear of being called racist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FormerlyKC @DarrenPlymouth It was made clear if they were broken, the police would enforce. So not surprising is it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Regardless of whether today’s protests in #TrafalgarSquare were peaceful or not, they went AGAINST the social distancing guidelines and rule of 6.   It has been made clear many times, if you break these rules, the police will step in. These rules will help avoid another lockdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarrenPlymouth Whether it was peaceful or not, it goes AGAINST the guidelines on the rule of 6 and social distancing. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was always going to happen, not sure why it was granted in the first place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarrenPlymouth They shouldn’t be going against guidance that’s states not to attend large gatherings. None of them are socially distancing. They have been warned that the police will enforce it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that was drama in the Man United game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_265__ @Johnhodg10 @NikkiStix55 @SadiqKhan @metpoliceuk I disagree with all. The BLM protests should have been better policed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All this type of behaviour does, is potentially force Boris into doing another national lockdown.   @BorisJohnson is resisting a full lockdown atm, keeping our pubs &amp; bars open. If cases keep spiking, his health advisors will force him into lockdown. Avoid it, follow the rules.  https://t.co/JG6mDkp2OR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR I slow spread yes &amp; I don’t think lockdowns are the answer. But Boris can’t ignore his health &amp; scientific advisors. He would be crucified if he did &amp; it led to a huge jump in deaths. I’m frustrated with protests that will not serve any purpose other than increase risk/look bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Problem is, the more that people break the rules, go to protests, the more likely it becomes that we will get another national lockdown.    Boris doesn’t want to do another national lockdown, as he knows how damaging it would be. Some people are not making this easy for him tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sgrmuk @Keir_Starmer @Conservatives @10DowningStreet Is there any facts to this? What was said? Some of us know Starmer is very deceiving and trying to use the covid situation to gain favour, but the majority I believe are brainwashed by him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought Nicola Sturgeon had said that the SNP had nearly eradicated covid.....not quite it seems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The SNP don’t care. They do things to put on a show, to demonstrate they have power &amp; to further their agenda of Scottish independence. Students are mere collateral damage. Will anybody say anything against Sturgeon? Not a chance. The same students and parents will vote for her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour are a truly disgusting party. #RT the hell out of this!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>22:12 on a Friday night and the country is closed 😞   I really can’t wait for this covid situation to be over. I look forward to the day you can meet friends and family without thinking about it. When you can do a spontaneous night out, and it lasts until the early hours...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I predict more EU bullshit coming our way. Can’t wait until the transition period is over. They aren’t friends of the UK, no friend acts like they have.   Britain can stand tall and be proud to have left that EU vanity and power project. 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Random #POLL To all pizza lovers....what’s your favourite takeaway pizza? 🍕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour know this isn’t true. If EVERYONE had followed the rules, we wouldn’t have a huge spike in new cases. If it was true, why is over half of Wales locked down? The Welsh Government is Labour run,  which either means Labour have failed or people aren’t listening. #LabourLie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lovely sight 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawnButlerBrent You’d stoke divide, you help cause things like this against the police<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ricky_K67 Really?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC First knives, now guns. The Labour Mayor is useless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get checked. We don’t want a ticking timebomb on cancer because we ignored it due to covid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet again, Sept PMI data suggests the UK economy growing at a fast rate &amp; way beyond the Euro zone.   I am confident that when Q3 GDP growth figures are released in Nov, it will show the UK recovering &amp; growing faster than most countries in the world.   Media will be silent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@apple_shwn Pesky twitter bans ay!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RockboltG That’s where people have to stick the the guidelines. Otherwise, we’ll end up with the pubs being shut completely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can people STOP panic buying. The supermarkets never shut in spring and won’t be shutting now. You’re just a muppet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulw1965 @GMB Oh and don’t forget to add he sold it all for peanuts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Credit where credit is due, she’s comedy gold on TV and in radio interviews. I miss that.   It will cooooooooost......sorry.....erm.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What I want to know, is why isn’t @SadiqKhan accountable for his failure to deal with this issue himself. He’s the Labour Mayor for London &amp; yet doesn’t do his job. He spends all his time blaming Government for his failures, whilst begging for bailouts because he’s incompetent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan If this is oxford street area, it seems they are all just hanging around shops rather than bars and pubs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J____P_______ @NWJK @RTB1230 @AndrewRTDavies @10pm @1020PM And you have a mass exodus at 10.20 instead 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LibDems @EdwardJDavey Oh have a rest. 1. He didn’t break any rules as you could travel if exceptional child care issues (wife was already ill). 2. He didn’t come into contact with anybody else, other than his wife and child. 3. You’re boring me now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KnittingMumWood Followed back. Spread the message 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lock whoever did it up for life. Life means LIFE. Criminals and terrorists should always face the full force of the law and shouldn’t be allowed to walk free again.   Thoughts as ever, with the officers family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ann06957684 Followed back. Push the message out! Happy Friday!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnneTow84880951 With a Labour Mayor for London, it’s no wonder!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tone_paul @jamesian01 Hahaha! My best mate is a hammers fan, so it’s all good! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How the fuck did somebody get a gun into the police or station?! Disgusting behaviour and whoever did this needs to face the full force of the law. This is unacceptable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealProfTwatter @defranklondon It’s been less than 10 months since the General Election, we’ve already left the EU, about to leave transition period and we’ve spent most of the year dealing with covid. I think Boris is doing just fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As it’s the SNP and Sturgeon who brought this in, Scotland will love it. I swear that woman could turn into a serial killer and people will love it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Edin_Engineer @DeniseMembery And Labour in Wales are fucking it all up too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do Scottish Uni students still support the SNP &amp; @NicolaSturgeon after they’ve basically imprisoned you? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rbinlee @GeodanNew @toadmeister These are SNP Scotland Government imposed, not the UK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Loui_1024 @KimsNutrition @allisonpearson @MattHancock I’m talking about thousands of young people with the virus taking it to elderly people 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShelleyHills4 @allisonpearson @MattHancock April we were in full lockdown. Now we are not, hence it can spiral out of control very very quickly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Loui_1024 @KimsNutrition @allisonpearson @MattHancock By sheep you mean not infecting the elderly? Because all I stated was with covid rife in people in their 20s, they need to follow the rules. I wouldn’t agree with a ban saying people can’t go home, I also go out all the time inc to pubs etc. So what part is looking like an idiot?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NWJK @AndrewRTDavies @10pm @1020PM Imagine if Labour were in power in the whole UK. Honestly, it’s frightening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Times like this we all need to stick together &amp; fight. We have a corrupt EU against us, the woke brigade, lefties &amp; people trying to wipe out our culture &amp; history. The more of us that follow each other, the stronger we’ll be. Boris backers, fellow patriots, let’s do this. 🇬🇧 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimsNutrition @allisonpearson @MattHancock Didn’t say they shouldn’t see anybody, I said they need to start following the rules, otherwise they are risking it spreading.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnneTow84880951 @allisonpearson @MattHancock The problem is, if everyone decided to take the risk and then deaths shot up, the Government gets the blame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sat in the pub and 2 police officers come in to do a full covid check of the pub. Things really have got tougher.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCScotlandNews Nobody will admit to being a student.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomhfh I just needed my face thankfully<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well well, @NicolaSturgeon has spoken. Who is going to admit they’re a student though now? Nobody. Impossible to police. Crass policy from the SNP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anybody know the ratings for the Labour Party Poltiical Broadcast last night?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnneTow84880951 @allisonpearson @MattHancock I don’t think students should be banned from going home at Xmas, I think everyone should be able to go home, but those same students should follow the rules or they risk infecting older people. I wouldn’t want to be responsible for giving the infection to somebody elderly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnneTow84880951 @allisonpearson @MattHancock That’s what they need to do. The only reason deaths arnt higher is cos cases are mostly amongst the 18-29s. If they all have it and take it home for Xmas, deaths will skyrocket. It’s basic facts Anne.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR @TheThreeColts Just made me hungry 😋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allisonpearson @MattHancock The parents and grandparents will be dead in the new year if the young don’t start following the rules and then take this virus home for Xmas. That’s one Xmas present nobody deserves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I despair 🤦🏼‍♂️  It’s like some are determined to force the Government to shut down everything and push us into another national lockdown.   Some people need to grow up and follow the rules.   The 18-29s group are the worst and will eventually take it to parents and grandparents...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RockboltG I agree. When official Q3 figures come out, I think it’ll show UK growth one of the strongest in the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Supermarkets never closed in the spring and won’t now. So why are people buying up all the loo roll and pasta? Utterly ridiculous and selfish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glasterlaw1 She’s worse than useless. Trying to take credit for everything the Government has done to help people. Makes my blood boil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour have nothing to say, so they attack anyway. Inept party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCPolitics @bbclaurak U turned 😂. I don’t think Labour know the meaning of the word. The Government put the furlough scheme in until the end of October, and have been working on new ways to help beyond that, announced today. Labour really are inept<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@francisobrienUK I hope so. But let’s be honest, to many people are dense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He’s an absolute cun*t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Melissa5857 @sgrmuk @Keir_Starmer @Conservatives @10DowningStreet Thinking objectively and not how we think, do you think it will go down badly ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What I’ve learnt about social media, is that sometimes you need to stick together. I don’t always agree with everything the @Conservatives do. But I know that @BorisJohnson &amp; the Tories are the only party that can protect Britain &amp; get us through Brexit. Let’s not let labour win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jo_beckett It’s not 12 yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UKLabour @Keir_Starmer That’ll be why it’s returned all over the world and the EU then. The UK is also testing more than any country in Europe. Anybody that believe this man Starmwr needs their head testing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who did the most Prime Ministerial Broadcast?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FTP1996 @Keir_Starmer  https://t.co/Zr8EclUW91<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer You’re an absolute disgrace. We all know it’s the minority of people not abiding by the rules that have caused the jump in cases. The Government is testing more than any other country in Europe and is doing everything it can to protect lives. I’m sick to the back teeth of you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrAindriu @Conservatives @BorisJohnson Spread the message!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnMcD99078996 I don’t think they are tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If anybody just saw that Labour Party Political Broadcast by Starmer should know the point I just made. @BorisJohnson did a public health message, whereas Labour used it to attack Government with lies and mistruths in a political attack. Absolutely disgusted with the BBC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour &amp; @Keir_Starmer always have a go at the Government over testing, but guess what, the UK is testing more than any other country in EU. You won’t know that from the media or what Labour tell you. Don’t get brainwashed. @BorisJohnson and the @Conservatives need your support.  https://t.co/P8ZEqoXJXE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What’s all this about Uncle Ben’s? Not another woke decision 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrGABaines @uncleporkie Isn’t this in line with the ‘potential’ cases shown from the CMO &amp; CSO on Monday?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There’s no level to which the Labour Party won’t stoop too. You can never believe a word they say.   They may have a new leader, but Labour are the same nasty, anti-british, brexit bashing, fiscal inept, bunch of liars.  https://t.co/MUjqB0gqfd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SaltyDuchess Completely agree. Boris’s wasn’t a Conservative broadcast, but a sober health warning. It’s bonkers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jillongovt @chrisgreybrexit As if. That don’t suit the agenda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will the @Conservatives be getting a right to reply in Wales against Labour and in Scotland against SNP? Didn’t think so. Also, Boris was a public health message, Starmer will be a Labour Political Broadcast. How can the BBC continue to get away with such bias? #DefundTheBBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardJMurphy He’s the PM of the UK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paulmlegend @NWJK @DavidLammy Failed at Brexit? We’ve left the EU and are leaving the transition period at the end of the year? What exactly has failed? Only thing that failed is the people trying to stop Brexit from happening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@niocalmccormaig @Conservatives @BorisJohnson Keeping taking those meds Paulie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paulmlegend @NWJK @DavidLammy You’re obviously both deaf and blind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. We have all seen a minority of the public not abiding by the rules.  Attending mass gatherings, protests, parties etc was against the guidelines. Because of those breaches, the whole country has to have tougher restrictions now. Some people need to grow up. #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This may be unpopular, but I am not going to falter in my support for both the @Conservatives and @BorisJohnson.  It’s clear that other parties and individuals are trying to take advantage of the covid situation &amp; further their own political careers.   I stand with Boris 🇬🇧 #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidLammy I just watched it and that is utter tripe. Starmer cant grasp the facts and is clutching at anything he can, no matter how inaccurate or misleading to try and score some points.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. People have short memories. They also don’t listen properly to his statements, whereby he said the majority have stuck to the rules but the people who have breached them, have caused the rise in cases.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People obviously want to absolutely destroy the economy &amp; jobs, bankrupt the country and create spikes in non covid related deaths. To say the measures don’t go far enough shows the country is a woke shadow of its former self. The country wouldn’t get through another war again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Impossible job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Washa19 @richie_1994wale Making stuff up on testing. Your beloved Europe is testing less than the UK, yet you say it’s the UK testing which is failing. At least get the facts right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Washa19 @richie_1994wale You should at least express based on facts, clearly you do not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Washa19 @richie_1994wale You just had a go about testing, yet England is testing. The most in the UK, and the UK is testing the most in Europe. I don’t think slagging off the testing is really quite clever based on the stats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Washa19 @richie_1994wale It’s a public health message. It was stating the new restrictions &amp; why they were coming in. Cases rising is down to breaches, mostly in the age range 20-29, which has been clearly evident. Demand for testing has spiked, hence issues, but UK is testing more than any country in EU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Washa19 @richie_1994wale But it’s not things like eat out to help out that have caused cases to rise. They were done covid safe, limited people, socially distant from others. Whats caused the rise is the minority few, attending big house parties, gatherings &amp; raves. THEY are the breaches Boris mentioned<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nandini_V_ @DAWilson246 @piersmorgan But due to compassion grounds, they’ve allowed an exception for funerals, even though it increases the risk of exposure. Much like people with medical reasons don’t have to wear masks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Utterly ridiculous. @BorisJohnson is the PM and gave a public health message, delivered from the Government, which isn’t political. Starmer will just do a Labour political broadcast, which is completely different. The BBC are utterly shameless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexwickham @Keir_Starmer This is ridiculous. Right of reply? He’s not the PM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danwootton There is no second lockdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarinaHyde A lot of people have had enough of you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nandini_V_ @piersmorgan You can’t see the logic that more people need to be at a funeral, as it’s their LAST chance to say goodbye. I despair. It’s completely different to a wedding. Surely you can’t be that illogical?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surely nobody is this stupid?! It’s quite clear why the difference and the logic behind it. Makes me angry this one.  A funeral is a last chance to say goodbye, so the Government has allowed more people to attend out of compassion, even though the risk is higher.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Funeral is purely compassion grounds as it’s a final goodbye, hence allowing more people. A wedding isn’t so critical, so they can lower the risk. I once thought you had an ounce of intelligence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>💯 agree with @IainDale 👇🏼  Things are tough, businesses will struggle, we will all have low periods &amp; we won’t all agree with everything Boris does, but there’s good intentions to protect lives &amp; it’s not another lockdown. Britain has been through wars, we can get through this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SGEndersby @benjaminbutter @AFHStewart More testing being done than any other country in the EU. I’d say that’s pretty good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretending that everyone has obeyed the rules and it’s the Government’s fault👇🏼🙄  Boris said not all have followed the rules. We all know (unless we live under a rock) that a minority few have not followed the guidelines. It only takes a small few to go rogue &amp; it spreads again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benjaminbutter That’s not what he said. He said the minority are not following the rules, which is true. You only have to look around to see there are a select few that are not listening. Are you going to pretend 💯 of people are abiding by guidelines? It only takes a few to cause a spike<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR They would have pushed for a national lockdown for a few week. Boris didn’t do that. He’s kinda stuck between a rock and a hard place, but for now, at least things remain open. I agree, not ideal and I struggle to see how 10pm closing helps if everyone is sat down already<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@defyingtheleft something I said? Haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So what does everyone think the ratings will be for that Boris address? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are Labour banning alcohol being sold in supermarkets after 10pm? That has nothing to due with stopping the spread of covid.   Labour are using the pandemic to seize control in Wales and create a nanny state. What next?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Boris 💯  https://t.co/WfhC5kKocB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@biggles438 No. Labour we’d never be allowed out. Labour in Wales have just banned alcohol sales in supermarkets after 10<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Welsh Labour Government have not only announced they’re copying Boris in closing pubs, bars etc at 10PM, but they are going a step further....sales of alcohol from off-licences &amp; supermarkets after 10pm will also be stopped. Labour, that isn’t Covid related, that is control.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BritishAlba There’s hardly any countries you can travel too these days and hardly anybody is travelling really.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGov This is quite shocking. If people want tighter restrictions, they basically want to be told to stay home and not go out. Do people not want to live a life anymore? 🤯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGov Wow. That’s all I can say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg. How can people think the new restrictions don’t go far enough?! People just want to be in lockdown forever it seems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour haven’t changed. Same tired Corbyn policies, same Brexit, Britain bashing party, dressed up as ‘#NewLeadership’.  People may be frustrated with the #Covid_19 restrictions that Boris has imposed, me too, but @BorisJohnson is the only one that can take us forward post covid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK Boris isn’t doing a second lockdown, so can we stop saying he is ffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@campbellclaret @BorisJohnson You do talk a load of nonsense. The rise in cases is largely attributed to the minority who have flouted the rules. The Government doesn’t spread #COVID19, people do. Rules have been in place and some haven’t followed. Labour need to stop with this kind of mud slinging.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>22:01 at Wetherspoons....neck that pint!! 🍺  https://t.co/Y726QmHygt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @Keir_Starmer Get a room<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicolawitch Trying being in Scotland with SNP in charge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But yet Labour ignored the British people after #Brexit, continued to block Brexit, want to abolish the monarchy, have sided &amp; continue to side with the EU over Britain. Labour do not stand up for Britain, that’s a big FAT LIE. Only the @Conservatives and @BorisJohnson support 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WHY?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh Boris .... what have you done. #Covid_19 🍻  https://t.co/FbQSFnl8O7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR Do we even have any in primary schools?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Josh_Macc I think age is showing a bit now. To say somebody should resign in the middle of a health pandemic, because you don’t agree with some of the measures he’s brought in off the back of advice from many people/experts, is quite immature and selfish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SNP have gone too far, too quickly. To ban households mixing completely at this stage is utterly ridiculous. Many will feel anxious and depression and mental health will be severely impacted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbclaurak Boris Johnson has gone far enough thanks. Sturgeon has gone way beyond and is making life, not really life at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pre drinks start at 9am methinks.  https://t.co/jCp4cBiTKZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hate that woman!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This country is turning into some sort of pandemic zombie film. Can’t wait to see it all unfold....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is one thing I 💯 support @BorisJohnson on. 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrwtffacts 🤢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We should all count our lucky starts we can still see friends and family outside of our households here in England I guess.... thanks Boris<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She always has to do something different.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MartinDaubney Well said @MartinDaubney 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidLammy @Keir_Starmer @lisanandy Labour isn’t british in the slightest. Don’t have an ounce of patriotism in them .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Josh_Macc @JoshSmithSpears If people carry on ignoring it, the whole economy will be shut down. We may not like it, but I’d rather stick to groups of 6 or less and have things open, than not, and then everything is closed.  If people had stuck to the rules, I doubt we’d be having all these new restrictions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So true. SIX MONTHS !! 🤯😰  https://t.co/TZ7eQfHSCM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laidmanr This is what makes me so angry. It’s this behaviour that has caused these restrictions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry, but I’m still mind blown by this #covidbriefing by Boris.   SIX MONTHS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That takes us to Easter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All nights out cancelled till Easter then.   Thanks to all the people who didn’t abide by the rules, didn’t socially distance, went to massive parties and raves. You have collectively closed all our pubs, bars, clubs and restaurants at 10pm for the next 6 MONTHS *slow 👏🏼*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agreed with Government that we all needed to stand together against #Covid_19 and abide by the rules.   I also believed a small minority were being reckless and spoiling it for the rest of us.   I was supportive of measures to balance health with the economy. BUT NOT 6 MONTHS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can’t get my head around what Boris just said. #Covid_19 can change, a blanket restriction for 6 months is surely utterly ridiculous.   Pubs, bars, restaurants, takeaways etc forced to shut at 10pm for 6 MONTHS !!!!  Has any other country put in restrictions until April 2021? 🤯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>6 MONTHS?!?! Surely my ears are deceiving me.   How can we say that no pubs, bars, clubs or takeaways can stay open later than 10 till at least Easter. 6 months is too long to say at this time surely?! I thought we were getting a vaccine. #Covid_19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kateferguson4 @UKLabour If anybody buys that Labour is patriotic about the UK, they need their head testing. They are still siding with the EU over Britain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears It wanted ppl spending again near their offices, in the summer months. Situation has changed. Your looking at everything with a very narrow lens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samiraheydari19 @NeilClark66 @simondolan @allisonpearson @Francis_Hoar It’s the pandemic, not the Government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR Easy for Labour to sit there an moan, but if they had been in charge, they would have faced the same problems. If anything, Labour would have been worse. The Conservatives came up with the furlough scheme quickly and the idea of eat out to help out. Labour arn’t the answer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears Companies have said the jobs won’t be needed for potentially 1-2 years in some cases. The furlough scheme is therefore holding people in a job that doesn’t exist, whilst costing a fortune.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulfish2skyco2 Have faith. It’s a tricky balancing act atm and we still have brexit to finalise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Later today @Keir_Starmer will ask you to take a look at Labour again. If you take another look, the leadership may be new, but the attitudes to Brexit, Immigration, Law &amp; Order, British Culture and the Economy, remain the same. Same old Labour, same old policies. No thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Josh_Macc @JoshSmithSpears I guess we all have to be a bit grown up about it and not do that. I’ve cancelled my housewarming because I’m doing the responsible thing. Are you saying that with a 10pm close for pubs, we should all be reckless and break all the guidelines on the rule of 6 &amp; social distancing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour always took for granted these northern voters. Hence why they thought they could ignore how they voted in the referendum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour isn’t patriotic. The end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR At least Boris isn’t closing them down, like many wanted. The economy, inc pubs must stay open.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Didn’t take long for that to leak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anybody give a shit about what @piersmorgan says anymore? Seems to me that he’s just an attention seeking idiot, with a grudge against Boris.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unilever's Dutch investors vote to shift headquarters to UK - #BrexitReality  Once Covid is in the rear mirror, I have no doubt the UK will prosper outside of the EU. Only the ⁦@Conservatives⁩ and ⁦@BorisJohnson⁩ can lead that 🇬🇧  https://t.co/gsJ4hfOWuM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @BorisJohnson That was the science and medical experts. He’s been in meetings all day, followed by COBR tomorrow and a statement. Do you ever give it a rest?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anybody watched Ratched on Netflix? What a peach that was to watch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HimpfenJack13 @EssexPR That’s independently done. Nice try.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afneil People don’t get drunker, have longer periods in the pub mixing etc. Just a guess though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Silo1978 @honeyfox27 @SkyNews He didn’t though. But the fact you’re still mentioning clearly means you never understood, so hey ho. But btw, you were allowed to leave for exceptional cases such as child care issues. His wife was ill, and believed he would be too, hence he left. Not contact made with anybody<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stone_Age_Girl @MrHarryCole @andreajenkyns Get a life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Silo1978 @honeyfox27 @SkyNews Who didn’t break social distancing, thereby didn’t spread it at all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews @TracyK199 Covid doesn’t spread by itself. Some who haven’t been abiding by the rules have spread it. Trying to butter up the nation with false and inaccurate statements is kinda pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure Labour know this, but not EVERYONE has followed the rules. Minority of public have not been socially distancing &amp; some have been going to huge house parties &amp; raves. Covid isn’t spread by the Government, but by each &amp; everyone one of us. Labour trying to score points 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂😂😂 He looks nothing like Blair!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The left are desperate to get rid of Boris, even if the accusations are a pack of lies, which btw, have been revoked by the initial source. I have heard no apology from Miss Cassidy....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OxfordDiplomat And it was false.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nick_Pye You won’t know if they’re accurate if interventions are made. To have the figures become ‘accurate’ is to say you want 50k cases and 200 deaths a day. I don’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same old lefty tossers out in force today. Got nothing better to do than spread inaccurate claims and do their upmost to get some pathetic # trending. Mel is on point 👇🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allisonpearson @CMO_England I never heard them say cases are doubling every day. They said every 7 days. Maybe your friend should listen better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only reason cases have gone up (partly shown by the fact the majority of cases are people in their 20’s) is due to big indoor house parties &amp; raves, with no social distancing. People who go to pubs have generally been sensible &amp; followed the guidelines. A few selfish idiots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The government is not considering a new lockdown across the country right now.  The PM is not about to tell everyone to stay at home either, as he did in March.  Yes, we will likely see tougher restrictions, but that was always inevitable if not everyone followed the rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So that’s pretty much the whole of South Wales the Welsh Labour Government have locked down now. Eeek.   https://t.co/rdjJh9nOA0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Government said it was safe to go to pubs with social distancing etc. Let’s be clear here, the increase in cases aren’t coming from the people who went to pubs and followed the guileines, it’s from #covididiots who didn’t and attended big raves and parties.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MahyarTousi Drinking in pubs for example doesn’t spread it if you abide by the rules. The increase in cases is from the people who attend mass parties and are not following the rules. That IS down the the public to stop. The trouble is, a minority of people get wreck it for everyone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR @SkyNews There won’t be a full national lockdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWildebest @EssexPR I think most of us agree, no new national lockdown, but some people do have to start behaving differently. The vast majority are careful and abide by the rules when they go to pubs etc, but some don’t give a sh*t and it’s them that are causing a spike in cases.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@berenbergdc @thepieman84 @EssexPR Not true. It’s based on % of positive tests of all tests done, not the amount.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is anybody actually listening to Labour’s Anneliese Dodds today? I don’t think she’s going to get much airtime today after Whitty and Valance presser, which is probably for the best, knowing how much rubbish comes out of her incompetent mouth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disagree it’s to prepare for a further national lockdown. I believe it’s a stark warning to get people to be careful,  and that it’s down to us to avoid another lockdown. Yes, there will likely be tougher restrictions, but I don’t believe there would be another national lockdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thepieman84 @EssexPR They’ve had some big restrictions last few weeks mind, such as masks outdoors etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What *could* happen if we all behave like idiots. Very much a worst case. As long as we are all careful, this won’t happen. Let’s avoid another national lockdown, which would be very damaging.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR France is having over triple the daily cases to us....I do think they need to do something, but I wouldn’t agree with a second lockdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An apology would be nice too, explaining exactly why they lied.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boris can’t win whatever he does. I hope the majority can see he is doing everything he can, whilst balancing the risks, keeping the economy open and listening to the medical experts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As I said, very unlikely the Government would push the self destruct button of a second national lockdown. However, they can’t do nothing when cases are rising &amp; it’s only a matter of time before the elderly &amp; vulnerable get it. Balancing act like no other, a lose lose situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vitt2tsnoc Well the fact you bet on your sister, when No10 have given his exact whereabouts now says a lot about you .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Normanjam67 He wasn’t there, get a grip.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmmaKennedy He was at a christening on Saturday, it’s a fake story. The fact your spreading fake news says all you need to know about you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missalicegrant You do realise that he’s put rules in place &amp; it’s us who need to abide by them or risk cases going up further. He’s not threatening, but is a making a valid point that if things don’t improve then it is the public at fault, for not listening. Only we can stop the spread<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brace yourselves.....🙈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good on them. I suggest your viewers tune into another programme.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a joke. Labour have said before they want to continue spending billions upon billions, as well as keeping the furlough scheme going indefinitely, so this is utter lies, designed just to have a go at the @Conservatives. Labour only have words &amp; recycled Corbyn policies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We can all avoid a second national lockdown. Let’s just use our heads.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The thought of work again tomorrow.... 😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews  https://t.co/xVfB2Vw4Ss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As much as I don’t want another national lockdown, if one happens, it will be because more and more people are not following the rules that are in place. It’s to save lives and prevent another lockdown. The below I fear is becoming more accurate by the day 👇🏼  https://t.co/0F4rKkKltJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveParker1971 Any source?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bwsinvegas Maybe some people just don’t want it shoved down their face, it doesn’t mean they’re racist or aren’t behind the message itself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More labour scare stories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SadiqKhan What a load of absolute crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think @Keir_Starmer should get his facts right on #Marr and #Ridge, rather than spitting out a misleading and inaccurate lines to score political points. Same as Corbyn, dressed up as ‘New Leadership’.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mt314159 I don’t believe that. The economy getting trashed does not help Boris, but it all depends on how ppl react<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joe_walland @MattHancock Tests being done is over 200k, more than any other country per 100,000 people. So kinda is world beating. It’s just demand is sky high atm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Melissa5857 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@prydainreview I’d rather people didn’t take the risk regardless and stuck to the rules. It’s not that hard. I’ll probs have to cancel my house warming and im not moaning 24/7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tractorboynz Is that another 450,000? As they lost around the same last week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t want another national lockdown. It would be damaging for people’s health, mental wellbeing, jobs and the overall health of the economy. Therefore, I urge everyone to follow the rules. Going on a bar crawl when you’re meant to be self isolating for 14 days isn’t clever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s true though isn’t it. The Government is doing everything it can to prevent another national lockdown, as well as trying to protect lives. If cases spiral out of control, it will be down to the public not abiding by the guidelines set out. It’s in our hands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liamgallagher @Robbo1992x It’s because generally people get drunker the later it is. It’s also to create some balance by having shorter periods for mixing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Themiddle03 1. To call everyone a racist that disagrees with it, says more about you than them.  2. It’s not hard to see it on social media, you don’t need to be watching 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour don’t even know all the stats or data on London, yet they make crass statements like this for headlines. A pathetic Labour Mayor that hasn’t done anything for #London in his whole time in charge. How long until he wants more bailout money from the UK Government? #SackKhan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stevethsoundman Not watching this yr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Donatedparts Decided not to watch anymore after last week. Who wants to watch constant messages like this. It’s gone too far now. It’s doing more damage now than anything else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SNP are absolutely sickening. They don’t care about saving lives, all they care about is independence and power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarrenPlymouth Love the fact there is a welsh flag, when any lockdown in Wales is done by the Welsh Labour Government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are testing more than any other country in Europe &amp; our positive results today were just 4,422 compared to France that had a huge 13,498. UK is still doing quite well, but you won’t hear that in the media. Let’s keep our heads, be careful &amp; then we can avoid another lockdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR If people abide by the hands face space thing, we won’t have another. But some people are just too selfish and too stupid and might just fuck it for everyone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are football teams STILL taking the knee?! It’s beyond a joke now. Is it a forever thing now or something? 🙄 #MUNCRY #ARSWHU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No no no. It’s fecking awful these days!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@francisobrienUK A new level of ignorance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour always banging on about how badly @Conservatives are running things, but Labour are in power in Wales for health &amp; everything is being done far worse, with testing barely existing.  The infection rate of covid 19 is also worse in Wales per 100,000: Wales: 39 England: 38<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SophieT01336713 Just sold our gold, bankrupted us, wrecked our economy, got people stuck on benefits and taken us into an unneeded war<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully this helps  https://t.co/zQ1g9hKxzd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MahyarTousi Probably a scare tactic to get people to follow the guidelines.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just one person not following the rules, can mean spreading it far and wide and spoiling it for the rest of us. So frustrating!   https://t.co/3GMJMDXfMj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I miss the days when you could go out and just dance the night away, whilst getting hammered 😞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very dark but powerful episode. Hope he gets his comeuppance. People like that make me sick. #Eastenders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well said. Only @BorisJohnson and the @Conservatives are fighting for the UK. We must keep backing him. Let’s not let covid get in our way. 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>London needs a new mayor in @ShaunBaileyUK, not more of the same incompetence from @SadiqKhan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KayBurley @MattHancock Wow, are my eyes deceiving me?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awful decision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tobias_Ellwood Biden isn’t the President, not is he an ally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because the EU decided to go back on what was agreed and reinterpret some of the agreement, whilst threatening the UK. Hence @BorisJohnson had to put in place something to protect the UK. Shame Labour sides with the EU each time and not Britain. 🇬🇧 #bbcqt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems #bbcqt are at it too 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The UK is doing more tests than any other country in Europe &amp; more per 100k than any other country. @BorisJohnson is leading a Government that is doing everything it can to meet demand for tests, whilst trying to protect lives. Don’t get brainwashed &amp; panicked by the media #bbcqt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t let the media brainwash you. The media &amp; programmes like #bbcqt want to mislead the public &amp; turn people against Boris. They want to cause hysteria &amp; panic, much like Labour want people to rely on benefits. Don’t let them do it to you. Trust in @BorisJohnson, don’t panic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t give a shit anymore thanks.   I’ve had enough of the media misleading, brainwashing and generally lying to the public, in order to cause hype and panic.  Nobody should watch #bbcqt anymore, as it’s just a biased, lefty infused, anti Tory Government propaganda machine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sgrmuk It’s disgusting and yet they get away with it. Somebody needs to hold them to account. Far too many people are now getting brainwashed by the media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The media have a lot to answer for. They grab onto one little thing, blow it up and make everyone panic so that something small, becomes a nightmare. The media are causing panic, the media are causing people who don’t need tests to demand them, the media are a disgrace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears You do a national lockdown and it would be a catastrophe as it would destroy the economy, people’s livelihoods, jobs etc. It will also increase depression, suicides etc. However, you can’t just do nothing. You have to try and control rises in cases as they happen. Balancing act.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears Don’t agree. I did help out to eat out every week. I was sat at a table, distanced from others in the restaurant or bar. That is not what is driving cases. It’s not uniformed &amp; is being driven by young having parties etc.  The government is trying to balance economy with health<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears Deaths are low due to the cases being amongst the young. If there’s tons of cases, eventually that starts spreading to older people too, especially at Xmas. Then we get deaths in the thousands again.  As I said, the tougher new measure are due to people not socially distancing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears If people had abided by the rules, cases wouldn’t be going up now. If they don’t bring them down, come Xmas deaths will go up massively<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears They are all doing tough restrictions in different parts of the countries. France is doing it constantly, they have to wear masks outdoors in some areas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears It’s being ruined becuase of the spread of the virus is going up again. Only people can sort things. You can’t blame the Government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another April fool joke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely ridiculous. Labour are in charge in Wales and need to take some responsibility. They’re a shower of sh*t. Maybe if they didn’t delay making masks compulsory, just to be different to England, there wouldn’t be a lockdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People need to understand a few facts: 1️⃣The UK is doing more tests than any country in Europe inc more than any country per 100k.  2️⃣If demand for tests is huge, the system will always come under pressure.  3️⃣The only people who can stop the spread &amp; need for tests, is us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The media are really starting to brainwash people with their misreporting, endless attacks on Government and lies. No other country has a media that attacks the Government so much for no reason. The Government is facing a global pandemic like no other in modern times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m sick of all the BLM political messages all over the TV these days.  It’s being shoved down our throats. This isn’t right. If anything, I’m finding more racism against white people these days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvonandsomerRob No. Pure racism going on by sacking people who are white. She may be good, but there’s only a vacant job post because of racism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toadmeister He’s dealing with Covid and following medical experts, give him a break. Any PM would have to do the same. So many people just wanting attention atm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poke your nose out @JoeBiden. Your supporters are looting, causing destruction and burning the US to the ground, and yet you have the  audacity to comment on stuff you know nothing about in the UK. Concentrate on your election in the US, which I might add, I hope you lose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boris answering exactly how we see it. The EU are not. Good faith does not involve threats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stick to the rules folks, we do not want the elderly getting this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liambyrnemp @Keir_Starmer Yet their testing more per 100k than all other countries in Europe. Lies lies and more lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remainers are out in force today. Not one for blocking, but I’ve had enough of some today. Totally clueless, totally brainwashed, anti british and very arrogant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ianbetteridge @kasiewasie @BBCNWT @bbclaurak It’s over 200k tests. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody tell him it’s not April Fools day 👇🏼 Was a very bland PMQs and most of the points she made were absolute rubbish, as you’d expect from Labour. Never on the side of Britain, but the EU. #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vicderbyshire It’s 3 months away ffs. A lot can change in that time. Pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer Testing working well then. Better change tack and do a u-turn at the next #PMQs you do then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A fast turnaround then &amp; not the shortages/delays you have been banging on about at #PMQs every week. The UK is doing around 200k tests per day, which is a staggering amount, esp compared to other countries. Maybe now you can stop lying, just to try &amp; score points against Boris.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jo_beckett They don’t have a nation panicking and they don’t have a media like ours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Angela Rayner is standing in for @Keir_Starmer at #PMQs , representing Labour, who want to be in power. She’s blocked half of twitter for disagreeing with her, and won’t engage with anybody. Labour are not the party of the people, the @Conservatives under @BorisJohnson are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@transartforall @BBCNWT @bbclaurak How many tests are done each day is being released, but yet you don’t think they release those figures. Puzzling. Either way, over 200k are being done each day, and more than Germany.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@transartforall @BBCNWT @bbclaurak The UK testing figures are not made up. The UK is consistently doing more than 200k tests a day, and the figures are released daily. They have now done more tests than Germany over the last few months. Get your facts right, don’t just claim they’re made up cos you don’t like them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@transartforall @BBCNWT @bbclaurak Stats please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Over 200,000 covid tests are being done EACH DAY. But apparently, that isn’t nearly enough to cope with the demand for tests. I may be wrong, but I don’t believe that well over 200k people have symptoms of Coronavirus each and every day. Sounds very very strange to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leby_uk @BBCNWT @bbclaurak 200k tests a day not enough?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kasiewasie @BBCNWT @bbclaurak Again, socialists always misleading. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kasiewasie @BBCNWT @bbclaurak You said we were one of the lowest in Europe to me saying we were one of the highest in EUROPE. How many countries in your chart of in Europe? About 6. And how many countries in Europe? More than 28. So we are one of the highest, as I said!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kasiewasie @BBCNWT @bbclaurak So how many tests are the likes of Greece, France, Italy and Germany doing a day? I don’t believe you know any of the actual numbers, and as a socialist, lie your way through life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kasiewasie @BBCNWT @bbclaurak That’s absolute rubbish. For example Greece are testing around 14k a day, with a population of 10.7m. Do you even know facts?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nigel_callaghan @WelshConserv They haven’t sold the English NHS, so stop lying you absolute tool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCNWT @bbclaurak The Government of the UK is doing more than any country in Europe. Yes, there will be challenges doing tests in such a huge scale but the UK is doing more than anyone. Pathetic to moan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Except Labour in Wales have done the exact same thing as the @Conservatives 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulwaugh Most people’s phones are something like 5 times that. People can buy what they want with their own money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ImigrantSouth @RealDeniseWelch Not true.  One of you could go out and meet 5 friends. Or do you not do anything separate?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour never deliver for the working people, nor do they listen to them (aka Brexit).

<|startoftext|>@patrici61580698 @RealDeniseWelch Oh what a load of absolute crap, typically lefty response.

<|startoftext|>@banksyboy1975 @RealDeniseWelch Pubs are socially distanced &amp; sitting down in groups of 6 or less.

<|startoftext|>@RealDeniseWelch I think you’ve gone overboard now @RealDeniseWelch. I agree with some stuff you say, but you’ve crossed a line.

<|startoftext|>This a joke?! These two are jokers that none of the British public trust on Brexit. @BorisJohnson has the UK  and union best interests at heart. Back Boris, back Britain and kick back against a corrupt EU. I back the @Conservatives 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remainers together 🤢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy Birthday to my mum @LindaBEdger. Biggest brexiteer I know atm, give here a follow. She is british and proud 🇬🇧  https://t.co/NFWVpjfyD4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You supporting Boris @EllisCole_<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EllisCole_ Amazing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaisyAdeleleo @BorisJohnson But guess what? Everyone will have diff views on how to deal with coronavirus. He’s following the experts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cheers to @BorisJohnson sticking up for the UK. I will always support and vote for the person who stands up for Britain. 🇬🇧  https://t.co/dO7hJzjeDI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Relaxed in Rhodes.....  https://t.co/W5NJjJLsml<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Femi_Sorry @BorisJohnson Very<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrew_lilico Which it is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Backing @BorisJohnson all the way against EU threats. This is exactly why we voted to leave &amp; exactly why on 31 Dec, we will be shot of them finally. If they don’t want to negotiate a trade deal in good faith, without threats, then they can sod off. Back Boris, back Britain. 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tobias_Ellwood No mate, what’s damaging is giving in to EU threats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nasty side of the EU coming back out to play. We must back @BorisJohnson as he tries to protect us from the EU changing the meaning of the N.Ireland protocol. They are a corrupt organisation and anybody siding with EU threats over Britain needs a hard look in the mirror. 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ridiculous. I support the efforts that of the NHS, but the country simply can’t afford to give NHS staff a 15% increase, on top of increases already agreed. Currently, far too many hospitals lie empty and so this is just sheer arrogance. Many of us never stopped working.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBulldog74 Absolute fuc*ing cun*s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boris: "I have to say that we never seriously believed that the EU would be willing to use a treaty, negotiated in good faith, to blockade one part of the UK, to cut it off.” This sounds like the EU we all know &amp; despise right now. Arrogant &amp; unwilling to negotiate in good faith.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealDeniseWelch Eating out to help out did not cause the wave, as that was socially distanced. It seems the most vocal on twitter are the 2 extremes and quite inaccurate information. If people kept space then there is no way it would spread. I ate out and I wasn’t near anybody but my group<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Arfatweet @LBC @ianpaynesport It’s not locked to 1%. What’s your source?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Following the @Conservatives lead then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Might this be why ⁦@BorisJohnson⁩ has introduced more measures? If he hadn’t, people would have accused him of doing nothing.   https://t.co/8SWIfqoYfU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCPolitics 🥱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HonTonyAbbott Thought we’d gone into 5th?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is London stupid or can it just not get past tribal voting patterns?! @SadiqKhan has broken promises, failed to manage London’s finances on @TfL, failed to build enough houses, failed to deliver things on time, failed to tackle knife crime. Completely incompetent Labour Mayor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kevin_Maguire 😂😂😂😂 Photo op much?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RockboltG Don’t tell the media<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Expect August to see an even sharper rise, especially after #EatOutToHelpOut. Just shows the OBR and all the economy forecasting is mostly always wrong, it was over Brexit and now over Covid. The UK economy is doing very well under the @Conservatives, don’t let Labour wreck it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lest we forget<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The first major post Brexit trade deal, that will bring in billions of extra trade to the UK, yet it doesn’t feature on @BBCNews. You just can’t make it up! #DefundTheBBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This really isn’t professional is it? Absolutely awful kind of response to a tweet and exactly why some companies deserve to lose customers👇🏼 #GrowUp #FridayFeeling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shows how much the EU was holding us back. Great news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>August is bound to be another huge bumper growth month, even more so. The economy is recovering well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wesstreeting @montie If it mattered that much, you’d have tried resolving it OFF social media. Just want the likes and attention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RockboltG @emilyhewertson Very true Rich. @emilyhewertson is one sighted at the moment, more interested in playing for likes than using her head.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyhewertson UK PLF’s are checked before arrival, so you couldn’t get away with not doing it, Greece’s aren’t checked before. That said, Greece didn’t check mine last week on arrival. Nor did they do any random COVID tests for my flight. Let’s not do everything for likes @emilyhewertson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a clever country right now then. I don’t see how they could be any clearer. Wash your hands, wear a mask in enclosed spaces, keep your distance. Don’t socialise in groups of more than 6. What’s unclear?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPJHodges It’s called balance. Travel is essential and so is going to work for both earning money and doing your job. Socialising is important, but in groups of more than 6 is not essential.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will all the people ripping into @BorisJohnson last night, now rip into @NicolaSturgeon? I don’t believe they will. #DoubleStandards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VBermoothes Pathetic tweet of the year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TiceRichard @BorisJohnson @MattHancock No national curfew as yet, no cancelled Christmas. What is truly unacceptable, is your lies and scaremongering.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jdlflower What?!? If true, that is utterly disgusting and an insult to the late Diana.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@foxesdale It’s a lose lose situation. Government can’t please everyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sadly, it’s for the best. The elderly and most vulnerable are at risk when covid cases increase.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PippaCrerar They’re not contradictory statements. Both can easily be true. What’s your point here? Can you for once start putting your Labour activism to one side and report the truth. if not, retire, as you are incapable of doing the job with any accuracy, truth or professionalism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Worst areas on this appear to be Scotland and Wales. So SNP and Labour run....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disappointed in this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can’t trust @Keir_Starmer or Labour. The UK is testing by far the most in the whole of Europe and yet Labour have a pop. Labour are also then silent on issues relating to Brexit, becuase they want you to forget they tried to block it at every moment they could. #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nailed it @BorisJohnson. Don’t ever forget, it was @Keir_Starmer as Labour shadow Brexit Secretary, that went on marches to try and stop Brexit. Labour can never be trusted. #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shame @SadiqKhan, the actual London Labour Mayor didn’t do his job. Always comes to the @Conservatives to clear up the mess left by Labour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahaha. Couldn’t be more accurate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPJHodges Being at work is a bit different to socialising in somebody’s house in a large group or drinking in large groups<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyhewertson They’re damned if they do, damned if they don’t. Don’t do further restrictions and potentially cases continue to rise, slammed for not doing enough &amp; be at risk of allowing more deaths. Do more, slammed for overreacting &amp; killing economy. Lose lose for @Conservatives. #Covid19UK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthea_bailey Agreed. But too many are selfish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There’s no chance. If you make friends at uni, then you’ll be pleased and will think fuck the rules, I’m partying. Uni life is uni life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TiceRichard There is no national lockdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealDeniseWelch You can eat out in groups smaller than 6 ya know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I find the movement of BLM now repulsive. It’s become so political, people are becoming sick of it. If anything, it’ll put us back decades.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@james1071 @SirRogerGale Very anti british arnt you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It seems some remainers in this country would always rather side with the EU than the UK. Truly crazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jackson_Carlaw The same for a lot of remainers in this country. Utter nut jobs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@james1071 @SirRogerGale Well then why don’t we have a trade deal?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Matthew25244003 @SirRogerGale But on the way they are doing it, we wouldn’t be an independent country. So what’s the point then? It’ll be no deal. If they think we’d accept things like not having control of our own fishing, they’re deluded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cammyk_67 @Harvest93573301 @SirRogerGale Not sure what exactly was the sound bite but hey ho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simontruetory @SirRogerGale Th trade deal was always something that woudl need to be negotiated, the EU don’t even want to give us a proper deal when it comes to our own fish in our own waters. They are corrupt. Also, your ‘immediate’ isn’t very accurate. You’re a disgrace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SirRogerGale The EU are negotiating in bad faith<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RockboltG The wasn’t the prorogation unlawful and yet Boris went up in the polls. This won’t even need to be a enacted if we get a trade deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMPSimor We need to to piss off with crass statements<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t see this in the media. It’s all negative shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidPoulden @realDonaldTrump @BorisJohnson I agree that the boats is a massive issue, but lots is being done behind the scene. Wouldn’t surprise me to see more announcements in the next couple of months. A lot has happened this yr that has taken the forefront.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SufyanAhmed02 @LBC No, but ppl get drunker etc. Then start mixing more. There are logical reasons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acgrayling You just make it up as you go along.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidPoulden @realDonaldTrump @BorisJohnson You seem to be struggling with facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🇬🇧 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@haveigotnews He’s never said that. Isn’t this just a lefty comedy show trying to undermine him and spread anti Tory propaganda?! I think so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shouldn’t be made political<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbclaurak 🥱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a load of rubbish from Labour as per usual. You cannot keep the economy closed, as millions will lose their jobs. Same old Labour want people to just live off the state, which is other people’s money. Socialism at its best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not doing a great job are you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank the lord I’m in Rhodes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on, @RishiSunak has done a superb job keeping businesses from going bankrupt and millions losing their jobs with the furlough scheme. #EatOutToHelpOut was also a great idea. Worth a vote against these Labour hypocrites.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boris: “Even at this late stage, if the EU are ready to rethink their current positions and agree this I will be delighted. But we cannot and will not compromise on the fundamentals of what it means to be an independent country to get it.”  👏🏼 @BorisJohnson @Conservatives 🇬🇧 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kevin_Maguire @GMB Maybe the EU should negotiate a trade deal in good faith as promised, rather than trying to swindle the UK into a shit deal that doesn’t allow us control of our sovereignty. Maybe then, Boris woudnt have to do such a back up plan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t see the rents or oldies for a few weeks basically.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scottish and Welsh Governments way to cautious over Greece, with the rates so low. One of the safest in the world. They are not even looking at the data, just trying to make political points that they have power there and decisions are based on fairy dust fiction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It seems @Conservatives PM @BorisJohnson &amp; @DavidGHFrost are not going to be like the @theresa_may days. Standing firmly against the EU is just what the doctor ordered. 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She’d have two left shoes 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can anybody stand Labour’s Dawn Butler (the nodding dog from Corbyn era)? One of the most vile, dividing &amp; truly repulsive individuals ever. The fact she has praised #ExtinctionRebellion, when they have blocked ambulances 🚑 is truly disgusting. Sooner she’s kicked out the better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BREAKING TEAM NEWS - Rhodes bound with mother 😂 Holibobs time! #Greece ☀️ 🌊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems that Boris is now standing a lot firmer on decisions...Dominic Cummings effect? Whatever it is, keep it up @BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BethRigby You lose<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sgrmuk @Geoffrey_Cox Oh I loved this!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After such a crazy year, I’m kind of missing hearing the voice of @Geoffrey_Cox in Parliament. Find it quite soothing myself 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh dear Co-Op. Another company that wobbles and bows to the lefty woke. That’s no @benandjerrysUK from the @coopuk for me.  Absolutely sick to the back teeth of all the nut job lefties in this country. It’s embarrassing the state of some people on the left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do like a bit of @grantshapps. Definitely an asset to the Government in my opinion. He balances a number of things well, including being on top of his brief, communicating with the public well, having a sense of humour and being relatable. Keep up the good work!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently it’s confusing. I’ll be honest, if you are confused over the different quarantine measure between the devolved nations, you’re literally stupid and pretty much dead wood. It is not hard to understand a few differences. I fear this is lefty crap.  https://t.co/CS1l6O6sQF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@britaiinelects @piiipluuup @OpiniumResearch Fake<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bella___Trixxx @BorisJohnson Yes, but he has so much to deal with, esp covid, some things are not as at the forefront as we’d like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattyharris07 @Brixton_Ben26 Lefty media<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Greece cases have gone down this week. At least get your facts right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notearsbeccaa Boris is the man!!! Kept it off!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LemonChickenOne Greece doesn’t have a spike. Cases coming down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LJ_YH2 @JasonGroves1 Join the club mate! My nerves can’t take anymore. Based on the data, Greece should be ok, but who knows based on what Scotland SNP did<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GillibrandPeter @vaughangething @GOVUK Any indications come out so far Peter?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomBurridgebbc What’s the most likely on Greece?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GazHigh @grantshapps Based on this, any quarantine for Greece is based on fiction not facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CARogersNo1 @AndrewRTDavies Probably.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews @Keir_Starmer Yet Starmer was happy to put a dangerous terrorist sympathiser as PM in Jeremy Corbyn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelpfulOlive That’s what’s baffling really. It’s not based on cases in Greece. It’s either panic becuase they think a few people who have flown back have had it (can’t price that as they could have taken it out there with them) or smokescreen as cases in Scotland are rising.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GillibrandPeter @vaughangething @GOVUK I don’t see how they could justify putting Greece on. Cases are actually going down and the rate per 100k stands at 13.8. That’s low and lower than the UK. It’s also well below the government’s threshold of 20. TUI are no longer going to Zante either. So nothing to gain from it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSunTravel Greece coronavirus cases have gone down, so I don’t see how they would be under pressure, unless they bow to Sturgeon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GillibrandPeter @vaughangething @GOVUK Thought they had that yesterday?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Warpdog But the rates haven’t spiralled, that’s the point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelpfulOlive Because the cases are well below the threshold for which they impose quarantine. Quite simple really.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juliesmith472 Very true. She’s unfiltered and extremely nasty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always rude.  Always arrogant. Always biased. Always obnoxious. Always misleading.  Always false.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samstreetwrites Will Greece go on it cos of Scotland is the question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katiewakenshaw Same. There’s no data suggesting Greece should be put on the unsafe list &amp; people be told to quarantine. Cases are low. What’s made things more iffy is cos of Scotland. Its whether Boris/Government are prepared to do what the data suggests, rather than what Sturgeon wants.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nailed it. It’s ridiculous. The left and the media are nut jobs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GillDurham Or maybe it’s becuase the cases in Greece are very low. 13.8 cases per 100k, which is below the quarantine threshold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SandyDerby2 @ZoeeEphgrave @PPaulCharles @transportgovuk @scotgov @PHE_uk @ThePCAgency @AudienceNet @TelegraphTravel @timestravel @BBCNews @SkyNews @FCDOtravelGovUK Exactly on 13.8, so lower than last week. Would be ridiculous to put 🇬🇷 on quarantine list.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer Boris Johnson’s Government said from the very beginning they would change, as the situation or the facts changed. In an ever changing pandemic, there has been a need for things to change or a u-turn as Labour and the media like to say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AS332L What a load of Bollocks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenkersBen So Greece has technically less official cases. Woudl make it bonkers to put Greece on quarantine ‘unsafe’ list.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NadiaWhittomeMP No other options? Erm....they’re in France!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly why it would be bizarre to take 🇬🇷 off the safe list. It’s way under the Government threshold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lolwestinghouse @owencocoefc Greece cases are very low. Get hold of some facts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MARKHANDFORD Same. And average cases in Greece are going down currently. At around 13/14 cases per 100k<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@safespec_elec @paulwaugh @MattHancock @AndyBurnhamGM I’m talking about in general. Everything is a u turn according to the media<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Marcs2020 @BorisJohnson Attempted murder shouldn’t be, and certainly not on British soil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Marcs2020 @BorisJohnson Russia are mega corrupt. They used Novichok in Salisbury to try and kill somebody, then denied it against all the evidence against them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cases last Wednesday were 293. Huge decrease. Most days over the last week have been lower &amp; average cases per 100k lower than last week. This is why @NicolaSturgeon’s decision to quarantine 🇬🇷 arrivals was no more than a smokescreen. UK Gov should NOT follow suit. @grantshapps<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KayEeGee Cases are in average around 13 cases per 100k there. That is very low and well below the quarantine threshold of the UK, which stands at 20. Maybe that is why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jamin2g Don’t really have the weather do we...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Russia and Putin are corrupt. Very worrying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulwaugh @MattHancock @AndyBurnhamGM In a pandemic, things chance, cases go up and down, decisions have to be made. They aren’t u-turns, they’re decisions being made in an ever changing pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NLeespeaking There was huge gaps between them. Clever camera angles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shock. Labour playing politics again and the group that have gone to the media claiming Boris won’t meet them, are currently taking the Government to court. Pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BethRigby @Rabberoonies They will be why the last 2 months have seen record growth in the economy then. I’m sure you’ll do your hardest to try and make it stick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Christmas is cancelled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely sick of Captain Hindsight at #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteEa51902487 Except cases in Greece are very low, under UK quarantine threshold, hence why decision in Scotland makes no sense to people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FreeThinker2030 @PaulBrandITV Maybe cos cases in Greece are very low.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cases down in Greece, yet @NicolaSturgeon puts Greece on the quarantine list. Why?! Seems she wants to distract people from the fact she’s incompetent and cases are rising in Scotland. Idiotic decision, but not surprising from the SNP. Smokescreen obviously.  https://t.co/hMn91AIaM8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Devongirl_64 @SimonCalder And we all know that Scotland were the worst in the UK on carehome deaths. She’s a slippery snake 🐍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dixxy1872 @willnash16 @BenkersBen Exactly. She’s got most of Scotland brainwashed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Devongirl_64 @SimonCalder She’s trying to take any bad publicity off herself for cases rising in Scotland and the tougher restrictions in Glasgow. Timing of announcing it today is v odd and the justification weak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Devongirl_64 @SimonCalder Ridiculous isn’t it. Cases have actually gone down lately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They’re only rising in Scotland, not Greece. Surgeon wants to hide her incompetence and blame Greece for her failures. Wrong decision and not based on facts at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willnash16 @BenkersBen I’ve always supported Government on quarantine measures, even if it’s meant my holiday being cancelled. But putting Greece on quarantine list for cases of around 14 per 100k would be stupid &amp; totally plays into Sturgeons hands. I hope they grow a backbone on this &amp; don’t give in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenkersBen @jennyatcheson So why this move? It’s odd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rumamay @BenkersBen True. Then Strurgeon blames Greece to take the pressure off her<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oliviaaimee @BenkersBen Media pressure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willnash16 @BenkersBen It’s ridiculous if England follow. Cases are going down. This is Scotland trying to take the pressure of Glasgow cases rising!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree with the below. Scottish Government decision on Greece makes no sense. Cases are going down in Greece atm. Way below the Government threshold of 20 per 100k. What is @NicolaSturgeon up to?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PPaulCharles @ThePCAgency @transportgovuk @TelegraphTravel @AudienceNet @timestravel Why have Scotland put Greece on the quarantine list then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews They’ve actually gone down over last few days/week. So it’s a load of bull.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenkersBen This makes no sense Scotland putting Greece on the list. Cases are low. At around 14 per 100k. Wtf is going on!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickeyst @nickeardleybbc Greece is only around 14 per 100k. Ridiculous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickeardleybbc Why?!? The cases are way below the Government threshold of 20 per 100k people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DexterTempest @BBCNews Well, we shall see. That graph is nothing surprising given lockdown. I see record growths in many areas and the recent PMI data is very positive. Maybe you should be more positive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Joker 👇🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCNews The last 2 months have had record growth. That means that when Q3 figures come out in November, it’ll show record growth and we are no longer in recession. It’s already out of date. Always glass half empty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a mess. He could barely scrape a sentence together, that then, made no sense considering it’s a new disease. Has to be Trump over this man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boris is definitely looking slimmer these days!  https://t.co/N3XVpYes8X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tnewtondunn @axios Well, if many European countries haven’t released their true death figures from March-May for community, care homes etc, then nothing can be accurate.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LeaveEUOfficial So why is it the 17.4m arnt behind him. Instead saying theyll vote Labour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The group pretending to be BLM in America will let @realDonaldTrump win. Nobody likes a group of people looting and causing violence &amp; destruction. It’s not about skin colour, it’s about not being a complete fucking cu*t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Devongirl_64 @BenkersBen Exactly what I was thinking. Far to easily influenced by a few panicked social media people and left wing media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NommeDeTwit Everyone I’ve looked at today had the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4ndyE @SkyNews The number of cases overall in Greece is very low. Overreacting isn’t going to get us anywhere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryAged @RealDeniseWelch That’s absolute bull.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealDeniseWelch Because it’s not proven either way. However, if the Government didn’t make it mandatory and deaths went up, they would be blamed. So in the Governments eyes, it’s better to be safe than sorry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I fear we are all going to have permanent sticky out ears by wearing masks all the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always good to hear something positive!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNewsBreak They could have had it before going to Greece, as there’s a 14 day incubation period. We don’t know anything really.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Josh_Macc How would you pay back the billions from covid?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andyrooke87 @realDonaldTrump Mate, I hate Biden. He’s awful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Put a bet on #Trump to win the #USElection2020. Let’s be honest, @realDonaldTrump is far better than that socialist Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liamhatton @Chris__Briney @BenkersBen @smcca8421 I think an average above 270 would be dangerous territory. It would still be below the 20 threshold, but definitely a risk and going in wrong direction. We saw on Thursday, countries can be taken off quarantine list at around 19 cases per 100k.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chris__Briney @BenkersBen @smcca8421 @liamhatton That is VERY good news!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EMMABOX @PPaulCharles Oh wow. You’ve just made me smile more today than anyone 😂 fingers crossed 🤞🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarolSu83442189 @PPaulCharles @ThePCAgency @FCOtravel @transportgovuk @SimonCalder @TelegraphTravel @timestravel @AudienceNet No. 2 countries were added this week that were at 19.3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenkersBen @smcca8421 @liamhatton When does Greece’s daily cases come out. I’m flying out Saturday, so every day is critical now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EMMABOX @PPaulCharles Same here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andrew_Adonis Blair/Brown. Borrowed too much when they didn’t need too, and sold off out gold on the cheap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liamhatton @BenkersBen Have all countries that have gone amber gone on quarantine list the next week?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jackjctaylor @PPaulCharles @ThePCAgency @FCOtravel @transportgovuk @SimonCalder @TelegraphTravel @timestravel @AudienceNet Well no, it’s just they haven’t restricted travel. But I’m just giving you the reason why they haven’t. That’s like stopping people in Wales coming to England.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jackjctaylor @PPaulCharles @ThePCAgency @FCOtravel @transportgovuk @SimonCalder @TelegraphTravel @timestravel @AudienceNet British Territory<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JewelleryDiva @PPaulCharles @ThePCAgency @FCOtravel @transportgovuk @SimonCalder @TelegraphTravel @timestravel @AudienceNet They added France and Spain to quarantine list weeks ago, and now the cases there are through the roof. It was a good decision by UK government. In Feb, too many brought covid in from Europe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simonhye @BorisJohnson I’m in the same position. Thing is, it all depends on cases out there. If they rise too much, it will be sudden. Can’t predict.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FuckYouJackDor4 @BisphamGreen @Manu_CB Except, he didn’t break any rules. He also socially distance and didn’t mix with anybody outside his household.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Huge increases in cases in the likes of Spain &amp; France. Over 7,000 in a day. UK has one of the smallest increase in cases, hovering around 1,200. Do the media, @piersmorgan etc praise @BorisJohnson &amp; the Government for measures they’ve taken? Nope, silence. They have an agenda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenkersBen Over last 3 days, it’s averaging around 270. Dangerous ground for uk quarantine<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ProfKarolSikora Hence the ad campaign coming from next week, expect to see a change in the language used then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andywaddington @grantshapps Could have picked it up 2 days before and woudnt come out in any test. This has been explained numerous times, how anybody can not know this is absurd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As much as I like wfh, I think office workers should now be encouraged to go into the office at least a couple of times a week. Otherwise, thousands of businesses will close and people will lose their jobs. It’s vital to keep the economy growing and people in employment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnneLawtey @afneil It’s not about money to Westminster. To the SNP, it’s all about power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Says it all doesn’t it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour are a disgrace. Nobody coming from France is fleeing war or torture &amp; are perfectly safe in France. Labour are always on the wrong side of what most Brits want/think. The side of illegal immigrants, side of terrorists, side of Russia, side of BLM protests, against Brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lovely Labour. Never change do they.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good! Finally the Government is starting to get a grip on this. A lot more to come I’m hearing when Parliament resumes....  https://t.co/lZ70OSguu7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCNews But since June, the UK economy, based on data that’s come in so far is showing the UK economy growing the fastest among major economies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How the hell is Kevin from Home Alone 40!!! How time flies ay guys!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is disgusting. I and many people I know will not donate to them now. The money should got to children in need, regardless of skin colour. It should not be used to fund black lives matter. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Normal103270532 Makes my blood boil, especially with the MSM doing the same narrative<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are people saying it’s another u-turn. It’s not. Things change during a global pandemic as new data comes available. Government always said it would follow advice and change things accordingly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonGroves1 @alexwickham That is not a u turn 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidLammy Don’t know if you’ve noticed, but we do not have the worst death toll. Most countries have not released true figures on community deaths. Also, the UK economy is now growing faster than other European countries according to the latest PMI data. Will be official later in year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I said this weeks ago. Looking at the PMI data, it’s clear that the UK growing fast at the moment. We won’t know official figures for months yet, but the signs are there. Doubt the BBC will want anybody to know that though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The NHS needs to resume all normal services immediately. I feel the NHS is now starting to let people down, who need treatment for non covid related reasons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go @BorisJohnson! British and proud. Our history should be celebrated and we should all be proud that our history and culture is what has made Britain what it is today. 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad Boris has condemned BBC for removing the lyrics from Land of Hope &amp; Glory at the Last Night of the Proms. BBC are a complete sham lately! British history should always be celebrated, no matter whether you agree with something or not. It’s what’s made us who we are today 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@britainelects @Survation Don’t think this is particularly bad considering the media onslaught of fake news and biased reporting. As well as all the tough decisions relating to covid the Tories have had to make. A growing economy, tougher on boats, and schools going back should start to turn things better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Matt528chap @SkyNewsBreak You do realise some things naturally change due to more info being known etc. If masks come in, it’s not a u-turn, it’s a decision taken based on an ever moving global pandemic. When a country is added to the quarantine list, it’s not a u turn, it’s because something has changed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Calling the British arrogant now 👇🏼  I’m not sure why these lefties want to remain in such a racist and arrogant country such as the UK... 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brilliant. Everything takes time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Normality is definitely coming back. The lefties will be angry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGov This just shows are people have been brainwashed. We already know that the likes of Italy and Spain have underreported in the initial few months by not declaring all community deaths. Yet the UK rates their figures one of the most accurate by this 🙈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kim Jong-un has seemingly died or in a coma again, for the umpteenth time this year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@francisobrienUK Trump over Biden!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet Labour and the unions keep trying to cause problems. One minute they say kids should be back in school, next they are trying to block it, it’s Labours way of confusing the message, then it hey can blame the Government. Playing politics with children’s education is disgusting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best way for London to recover, is to not have an incompetent Labour mayor in charge. That means getting rid of @SadiqKhan and electing @ShaunBaileyUK instead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlStewartOBE It’s isn’t though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who’s that behind the mask?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disgusting if true. Think the British has gone out of the BBC. May as well call themselves ‘Biased Broadcasting Corporation’ instead, as that is more accurate for what they are nowadays. We should always be proud to be british. 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has to be Trump over Biden for me. Don’t agree with everything he says or does, but at least he stands up for things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never seen so many brilliant tweets from @afneil in one night. Stick it to the lefties!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scotland has become a much nastier, dividing and damn right arrogant place under the SNP. It’s all about power now, rather than unifying everyone as one. Disgusted at how Scotland is turning the way it is. People need to wake up to the fact the SNP are the nasty party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The media should be doing a lot more to encourage people to go out, no scaring everyone.  The one thing that will destroy people’s lives now is not getting back to normality. UK rate is extremely low at the moment, lessons have been learnt and testing is the highest in Europe.  https://t.co/rCkN4gis9l<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon There’s not u turn, they’ve just extended it. All you do is complain. Maybe get off Twitter and sort out all the shit in London<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why the @Conservatives manage the economy, not Labour. No doubt the #EatOutToHelpOut scheme played a blinder in pushing growth higher. Such a great idea by @RishiSunak @BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great move by the @Conservatives here. Far to lenient. I have to say, I am really losing faith in some of the decisions judges make these days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Helenrug @BarryStill2 @WalesOnline @WelshConserv Wales is worse on everything compared to England, inc the NHS. Your Tory hatred is clearly distorting the facts for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mianicklin_ Mia thinks she was clever in her quote retweet. In fact it was neither clever nor funny, but wholly inaccurate and immature. Mia doesn’t like the fact Kevin was merely pointing out facts, so got personal. Mia is quite pathetic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paul_keepUKfree @Nick_Pye @Conservatives All planned? Boris certainly wouldn’t want to close the economy and put us into lockdown unless he was basically forced into it for health reasons. Why blame a Tory Government? Every party would have put the country into lockdown. Labour in wales for example has opened up slower<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paul_keepUKfree @Nick_Pye @Conservatives Let’s be serious, the last 6 months has been unprecedented. He’s damned if he does, damned if he doesn’t. He’s had to do a lot of things based on what the experts have told him, due to it being a global health pandemic. Don’t think decisions should be based on that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nick_Pye @Conservatives Whatever party had been in Government, you would have had lockdown, so don’t really see what you’d gain. Under Labour, things would be far messier, brexit wouldn’t have happened and they wouldn’t get the economy back on track. To say things like this is ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paul_keepUKfree @Nick_Pye @Conservatives Boris is getting Brexit done. We left the EU as promised in January. He didn’t extend the transition period, as promised. That ends on 31st Dec. Currently trying to get a deal, but standing firm. What exactly do you want?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>EU being difficult as per. Oh well, no deal it is then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lee21249405 @Flagg_ould @Davysom71 @afneil As I said, borrowing will keep going up until the deficit is gone. The Tories were left with the biggest deficit ever. They got that down by 4/5ths until this pandemic hit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is exactly why the ⁦@Conservatives⁩ Government took decisive action to make people quarantine from France. I’m glad lessons have been learnt and decisions are made quickly and effectively, to keep us all safe. Keep it up ⁦@grantshapps⁩ ⁦  https://t.co/c7Yrsv6dFG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GuidoFawkes 🤢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lee21249405 @Flagg_ould @Davysom71 @afneil Did you just not read my tweet which explains why 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pathetic. Boris has had everything thrown at him this year, from Brexit to a global pandemic, to then nearly dying in intensive care himself. A week break with his gf &amp; baby isn’t much, otherwise he’d burn out. Secondly, kids have done just fine with their grades &amp; Boris tweeted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lee21249405 @Flagg_ould @Davysom71 @afneil Because until you get rid of the deficit, debt keeps rising. Labour borrowed too much in the good years, saddling is with debt for decades. The Tories has nearly wiped out the deficit but then the pandemic hit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Davysom71 @afneil It’s all pandemic related and was unavoidable. This isn’t anything to do with planning you numpty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mianicklin_ Mia doesn’t know what she’s talking about and is still high on drugs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@minaisbby @JabinaB You’re the embarrassment with that tweet. Nobody is crying, just some want it to be fair. Your tweet shows a real lack of maturity, so doubt you’ll do well after school.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@janetba67794183 @doug_moore68 @grantshapps There’s not going to be another total lockdown! That’s the whole point in these measures<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesH17878370 @DaisyKirsch @janetba67794183 @grantshapps They look at numerous things. It’s medical experts looking at this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@janetba67794183 @grantshapps Also, it’s a good job this Tory Government have been paying your furlough isn’t it. Otherwise, you’d be on your arse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@janetba67794183 @grantshapps His holiday is in Scotland. I’ve had numerous holidays cancelled this year, and one booked in Greece in 2 weeks. If it gets added to quarantine list, I’ll be gutted, but I will support it. The whole point of it is to prevent infection coming back into the UK, like Feb.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope he rots in jail and never gets out. Scum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilkeeble @fairyfairhurst @FCOtravel @claireno2 @SimonCalder @talkSPORT @grantshapps @DominicRaab @BorisJohnson @ChrisSaintyFCO It is now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scotland’s economy will suffer and then they’ll want more money from England.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“Who are you?”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Accurate predictions? I don’t think so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely sick of all the crazed lefties on twitter, who think the whole world is against them. Any excuse to go out and protest, attack the Government or just moan about anything in general. It’s absolutely pathetic. What a generation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@akishan55 Jealous?! Nah mate, I just want it to be as fair for everyone as possible. Next year pass grades will plummet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@minaisbby I understand that it’s been frustrating as nobody could take exams, however, it’s clear that teacher predictions were overly optimistic. It’s not coincidence that there is a huge spike in pass grades, including a massive increase in the top grades.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MasonMaths That’s a different case, and they could have gone through an appeal, like in any other year. To do a blanket teacher predicted grades is wrong, and it clearly shows in the results how inaccurate they are<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MasonMaths If you can’t deal with exam stress, you can’t deal with work stress. Therefore, you can’t deal with a levels or uni either. It’s totally unfair to go on overly optimistic teacher predictions. The students threw a tantrum &amp; blamed Government to get a u turn. Generation of today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanym007 I agree. But the constant media attention and it being deemed nasty and unfair clearly was too much. I agree that should have changed decision after Scotland or stuck with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Conclusion from todays #gcseresults2020 is that teachers cant be trusted to fairly predict grades. How unfair on all other years now that #Classof2020 gets very inflated and much higher grades than all previous years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This proves that the algorithm was the most fair, but kids had a tantrum, protested, blamed Government and now have inflated grades they don’t deserve. #gcseresults2020   https://t.co/aM12iieji4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Labour claim that using an algorithm to set grades is unlawful, yet Labour, who are in charge in Wales, were going to use the same algorithm on welsh students 🙄 Labour will say anything to hoodwink the public.   https://t.co/rehirBkUDx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stuartbrown4 @allisonpearson A lot of people are used to wfh now, and some have been frightened by the media too much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGov Yet the A-Level results debacle included Labour making a u-turn in Wales. It just shows people don’t understand anything anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarolineHutt @britainelects @YouGov But to go mostly to Labour?! Let’s be serious, Labour would be ferrying them in, if they were in power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is also no legitimate reason for anybody to be ‘desperately’ trying to get to the UK in small boats. France is a perfectly safe country, so anybody saying they’re fleeing war and need to make the journey are lying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@britainelects @YouGov Major swing in a week, I can only really point towards the A Level fiasco. However, Labour did a u-turn in Wales, exactly the same as the Tories did in England, so don’t make sense. The A Levels thing wasn’t a Tory thing... 🤷🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@britainelects @SavantaComRes Go Boris. Boris has had so much thrown at him this year, but he’s getting things done. Starmer isn’t a leader, he says what he thinks people want to hear while changing his mind on things daily. He can’t stand up to the unions and tried to block the democratic will of the people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allisonpearson What restrictions are left? None that I can really see. People just don’t want to go out as much or go to work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They’re coming from France unnecessarily. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeoplesMomentum @pritipatel 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because Labour are so shockingly incompetent. To have Labour in charge of everything in Wales, should send shudders through every welshie there is. The Welsh Labour Government have been next to useless during Covid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who’s done the #EatOutToHelpOut? If not, get out there. Grab some food and get the economy fired up 🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good to see somebody calling out @SkyNews on their bias.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plus, it’s not even Gavin that gives the grades. It’s Ofqual. These lefties are nutters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t be a ratbag @EllisCole_ - now get the drinks in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because Gavin Williamson is a Tory. That’s all the crazy lefties care about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kent_keith I don’t regret voting for him. If you expected every single thing sorted and changed within the first year, whilst dealing with Brexit, then you were deluded. The main things re.Brexit/ending transition is being done. Other things take time re.illegal crossings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the SNP did a u-turn in Scotland, Labour did a u-turn in Wales and the Conservatives did a u-turn in England. Yet, it’s all the fault of the @Conservatives according to captain hindsight @Keir_Starmer of Labour 🙄 #ALevelsResults #UTurn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer How Labour have the cheek to say this, when the Welsh Labour Government did the exact same u-turn in Wales.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When grades are given out next year, there will be a huge plummet in the amount of students getting A* - C grades. Teacher predications are over inflated and are mostly always wrong. Grades were already up this year and that was with some being ‘downgraded’. #ALevelProtests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CrimeLdn Islington. Shoddy MPs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RespectIsVital Lies.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RobB64632325425 @Nigel_Farage @pritipatel Except they are doing things behind the scenes. Things take time. You can’t just snap your fingers and it’s all sorted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mt314159 @toadmeister I know you are. We won’t all have the same opinion on everything. With this, I just feel risks are lower if you ask people returning from France to quarantine. That’s a lower amount of people than if cases went up and then locking down towns &amp; cities, that could mean millions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mt314159 @toadmeister Very minimal amount of people of France compared to overall population. People knew the risks. If they didn’t quarantine, and we imported thousands of cases, that then created a second wave, parts of the economy would be locked down like Leicester etc. That’s more damaging.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevec3457 Blocked too mate 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mt314159 @toadmeister Having people from France quarantine isn’t going to effect others, nor should it scare others. I think it’s precautionary, but needed. Why risk having cases brought from France to the UK?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toadmeister That’s a bit irresponsible. The Government is trying it’s best not to import cases, like what happened in February. They are trying to protect the health of UK residents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is wrong with some people 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Clearly the Tories do not think it’s fine. It’s one thing saying things on social media tho and another thing actually putting a robust plan in place as part of Government, whilst fighting legal processes. Some things take time, stop doing everything for attention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>France now off the safe list. Another one bites the dust.... 🇫🇷  https://t.co/dtlQKF3D68<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marobec Exactly. Students have nobody to blame but themselves normally if they don’t like what grade they get, this for some, has given them the opportunity to blame the Government because their grade is lower than the unrealistic grade their teacher was predicting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If nearly 40% of A-level grades awarded today were lower than teachers' predictions, then how is it that people getting A* - C grades is still higher than 2019?! What unrealistic grades were teachers forecasting. I fear that teachers were massively over predicting. #AlevelResults<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AlevelResults show:  ■   9% of entries were A* (up from 7.8% in 2019)  ■   27.9% were A* and A (up from 25.5% in 2019) ■   highest ever levels of A* and As - up from a previous high of 27% ■   78.4% of entries were A*-C (up from 75.8% in 2019)  Hardly downgraded #ResultsDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So many people complaining about A-Level grades being downgraded and how unfair it is, yet A*-C grades are up from last year. People getting the top grades of A*’s and A’s are higher than last year too. Seems to me that people would complain regardless. #AlevelResults<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer Grades are up. More people getting A’s and A*, so no, there shouldn’t be higher again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flaneur_11 @DavidLammy @pritipatel They’ve come from France by boat, you saying it’s not safe there?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think she nailed it quite accurately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t believe @piersmorgan is stupid, therefore, he’s clearly a very dishonest man. Constant lies and misreporting all year. In a time when so many people feel vulnerable, they don’t need somebody knowingly spreading mistruths. Grow up &amp; stop being a petty child.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR 😂 I think Piers will be forever silent on this one....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Public Health England shouldn’t have been counting all deaths as Covid, just becuase they tested positive at some point. If I’d tested positive in March, recovered in April &amp; then got it by a bus in May, I clearly didn’t die from Covid. Good decision, lefties will be angry tho!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Certainly feels it! Get out the shower and I’m sweating again 🙈🥵  https://t.co/MHdf6NAbis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan We are a mostly services led economy, we were always going to suffer badly. I have no doubt we will rebound faster than many economies. Secondly, Spain has suffered worse and currently has a second wave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Soooo true!! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPJHodges @Mexico1978R There won’t be a sustained technical recession<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let’s be serious, the #recession is already over. Technically we were in recession April/May/June overall. However, the economy grew in June/July &amp; no doubt in August too.

<|startoftext|>I wouldn’t buy @benandjerrysUK again. They can go stick it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dunstablian Starmer woudlnt do anything, he doesn’t even want to leave the EU ffs. People need to give the Government time to do things, not everything is instant, especially when covid is around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stuartbrown4 @Conservatives @BorisJohnson @RishiSunak They?! You mean the virus did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Didn’t realise France was a country in the middle of war &amp; torture. Also didn’t realise that by coming to the UK they can escape ‘climate change’. It’s also illegal. More virtue signalling. Stick to ice cream rather than meddling in politics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Literally every restaurant I’ve seen this week has been packed full. I can’t believe how great this #EatOutToHelpOut is doing. Well done @Conservatives @BorisJohnson and @RishiSunak. Slowly getting people back out again. Time for a bit of steak myself 🥩 😋<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Current deaths still below average.   No spike in cases, even though cases are rising rapidly in Europe &amp; the world.   The UK is making great progress, as well as leading the way on a vaccine.   The @Conservatives furlough scheme &amp;  #EatOutToHelpOut are also very welcome.  🙏🏼 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lottelydia You need to get a life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zarahsultana They’re coming from France<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesSm79356044 @Nigel_Farage They delivered brexit as promised. They haven’t extended the transition period, as promised. They’ve been dealing with covid all year. The slightest thing that they don’t do fast enough for some people and it’s threats to go back to vote for Nigel and put Labour in power. Grow up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage And there’s been a lot happening since. Pipe down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryLineker Help? They’ve left a perfectly safe country in France to come here. They are not in danger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now would be good. Staying in is the biggest killer now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If something is controversial, Starmer hides. He flip flops on everything and shows exactly why he’s a weak leader.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The @Conservatives played a blinder with this #EatOutToHelpOut scheme. Seems like so many places are much busier than normal. The vital thing is getting people back out again and feeling comfortable. Well done @RishiSunak &amp; @BorisJohnson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OurParliamentUk @pritipatel I agree she needs to sort it out, but putting the X anywhere else would be far far worse. We wouldn’t have any control over our borders with the likes of Labour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zarahsultana Utter rubbish. Stop trying to create divides and a class war. Disgusting excuse for an MP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Plans take time. I like the fact you raise things, but your lack of ever being in Government shows when you think everything can be instant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sunny and hot I can deal with. Cloudy and hot, no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>France will be on the quarantine list next, guaranteed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PippaCrerar This is pathetic. I don’t believe they have produced any evidence of this second sighting of him back in Durham.... If he did provide some evidence he was in London, will these ‘witnesses’ be prosecuted for being lying cun*s?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MartinDaubney It’s not the lockdown, it’s the travel restrictions from abroad, which are critical to not bringing in covid cases<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🥓 🥓 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@susanstanwix From where?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time for a bit of #EatOutHelpOut. Been doing that all of July, but good to save some cash 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyPolitik And be called a a rapist online? I don’t think so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Positive signs the economy is rebounding. Data so far for July showing major growth and pubs and restaurants have seemed busy throughout July. Lots of restaurants are nearly fully booked, which is very encouraging.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@POLICEMATRIX Then fair enough then. But you don’t sling mud with no facts now. It could be an accusation that’s made up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We all know that there are many countries doing the same. Even the likes of Italy and Spain haven’t released accurate figures, failing to count for all care-home and community deaths. Truly shocking.  https://t.co/dGRi5V9j0T<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the hashtag  #ToryRapist is disgusting. Imagine if somebody accused you of rape &amp; you were innocent. Imagine what that would do to you. Innocent until proven guilty. Simply unfair &amp; truly vile to throw stuff about, without seeing any evidence. Let the police do their job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Says it all about the main EU countries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jannermaid1 @BorisJohnson When has Boris said this? Source? Oh wait, it wasn’t Boris who said it, but a newspaper.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nick2times @goddersbloom @DebbieE46116279 @BorisJohnson You read the papers far too much. What Government source is this? Oh wait, it’s not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goddersbloom He hasn’t done this, and is only one of a number of options. Do you take everything you read as gospel?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Innocent until proven guilty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Says one scientist, who no doubt is Labour. Can we stop speculating all the time. I very much doubt all pubs will shut again, as that would lead to job losses and the permanent closure of many.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EllisCole_ @MariahCarey All I want for Christmas is no restrictions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarrySheerman Piss off. The rules and guidelines are clear. Too many ppl are not following them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGov General public is not twitter or Labour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bit hot right now in here.... #heatwave  https://t.co/LdMhyQZg7I<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zarahsultana The spikes are down to some ppl not abiding by social distancing, especially mixing in houses and for religion. That is being attributed to a lot of areas that are mostly BAME. That’s not racism, that’s facts. Labour is the one that likes to create divides.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour complained at the start that the Government was taking too long to make a decision &amp; announce it. Fast forward three months, complaints from Labour that decisions are being made &amp; announced too quickly. Any excuse to complain &amp; have a go. #Covid19UK #handsfacespace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhilipH21343285 People are selfish. But selfish people mean the Government has to do unpopular decisions that punish people that do abide by the rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Overly confudent much. Sounds like Corbyn.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PaulBrandITV It’s 7 days for one, 2 weeks in a house.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ID to vote is something I’d expect in any moder democracy, especially when there is a risk of voter fraud. Are Labour worried they’d have even less seats?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@talkRADIO She’s deranged and rude. As I’d expect from the majority of Labour supports these days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If lots of restaurant chains are looking to close restaurants and make job cuts because they see that people are no longer wanting to go out anymore, what are people actually going to do in life? Sit at home for the foreseeable? God sake, people need to get out more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who hates moving? Such a ball ache packing. Absolutely hate the moving part, but enjoy the settling into new place bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage It’s a press job. He’s got other things to do that talk to the press for hours<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DVATW This is a ridiculous post. I didn’t expect the biggest global pandemic to hit the world that’s for sure. A lot of decisions are being taken that no Conservative Government would ever want to take. Grow up pinning on Boris.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nick_Pye It’s not hard to understand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stuartbrown4 He’s just being encouraging here. No control. It’s no more than I’d do with my friends if they wanted to lose weight. He’s not pushing anybody too, but drawing in the positives. Can no Tory be encouraging now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👌🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cardiff are shit. Such a disappointment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on Cardiff!!! #CARFUL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGov Labour and remainiacs love to moan<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Can’t please everyone, but decisions taken to save lives. A good move by the Government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree with so much Dan says, but not this. Spain, amongst many European countries, are seeing a massive jump in cases, we have to protest ourselves. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BOOM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good. The whole of Europe is getting a huge surge in cases, we aren’t. Let’s keep it like that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>An extra early night for me for a change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fucking hell, moving places is a ball ache. Cleaning and sorting on a Friday night... fml<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet the welsh and Scottish Governments will take all the credit for whatever they decide to spend (or waste) it on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TRexHen @EuroGuido That’s not true. The EU countries have not released accurate dead numbers. When hospitals in Italy were overwhelmed, many ppl died at home. Not counted in official stats properly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting sick of the Welsh Government and Scottish Government getting the credit for everything, including implementing things that have been paid for by the Westminster UK Government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Martytrudge It is sad, but you don’t have to wear a mask in the street.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thirsty Thursday!  https://t.co/0jaLov5oW9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like the EU are going to become very unstuck if they don’t start moving. This is a @Conservatives Government, led by @BorisJohnson, that will not falter to stand up for the people who voted for Brexit. The transition period will end in a mere few months. Tick tock. 🇬🇧 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really?! Yvette Cooper over @RishiSunak? He’s put schemes in place to pay people’s wages, has given billions for loans and grants to keep people and business afloat, 50% off food in pubs and restaurants next month, and people vote Labours Yvette 😂 Twitter is a strange place...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TEAMGB ALL THE WAY! 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is it unacceptable to say that the UK wants total control of its waters and to exclude the majority of EU boats from stealing all our fish?! It’s one reason we voted for Brexit.

<|startoftext|>Wow. Savage. Yikes for Forest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@latimeralder Plenty of us? Based on the stats, hardly anybody. Yes supermarkets people went too, but that’s it. And a 2m social distancing was in place then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@latimeralder Quite simple really. When in lockdown or partial lockdown, everyone was at home. Now everything is almost fully open or about to become that way, masks are wanted to stop another wave. Really not difficult.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour are at it again. More lies, more dishonesty and more weak leadership.  https://t.co/NH0HUaKxzr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCRealityCheck @bbcquestiontime He stood by Corbyn, whilst in the election he tried to elect him as PM. That says all you need to know about Starmer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PippaCrerar He did nothing. He carried on endorsing @jeremycorbyn as leader and tried to elect him as PM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour parasite👇🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour won’t change. They won’t accept the people’s decision. Don’t ever accept them as a viable party to vote for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who goes down, Aston Villa or Watford. Hmmmmm!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMPSimor Calling people fools, does nothing to help your case, nor will it change their minds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is no #NHSPrivatisation plan to sell it off. The @Conservatives will look after the NHS, as they have always done. Record funding is what is actually happening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Boris!!! The leader we need. 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is great news. All the money the UK Government has put into this, has really helped. I’m sure all the media and lefties will be hailing the huge victory so far on this.   Coronavirus: Oxford vaccine triggers immune response  https://t.co/sjUYv1usBO<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EssexPR @pritipatel The courts are a sham<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What a day. Never ever had such a fractious, heated and dishonest senior leadership meeting. I need a holiday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All good things come to an end. Sometimes, it’s just hard to let go. Onwards and upwards as they say though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarrenPlymouth I think it’s the o try and give some the confidence to go out. I don’t really agree with it, by the Government clealrly have their reasons and need to get ppl out and spending again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyhewertson I agree, however, the Government knows too many people arn’t going out spending because they are too afraid. It’s a lot to do with behaviour and giving more people the confidence.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@acgrayling Deluded<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The answer is no. The BBC is a propaganda machine, which is both biased and inaccurate in the reporting of the news it does. It isn’t fit for purpose anymore and so nobody should feel the need to fund such a failure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askaquestion01 Deluded. They aren’t accurate in their reporting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>💪🏼👊🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNewsBreak They are only closing 2 full department stores. Others are smaller versions, such as at home. Get the facts right.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PaulBrandITV He didn’t say anything against the staff though. Pathetic attempt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikehwalton It’s still getting worse though mate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The silence from @piersmorgan on what @RishiSunak announced today, as the @Conservatives chancellor, says it all. A set agenda of attack Government, scaremonger, spread inaccuracies and promote Labour. Disgrace. At least he’s off @GMB for a few months, saving grace. #minibudget<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toryboypierce @RishiSunak Big job now is to push the message out and try to make it help the economy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarolineLucas What a load of absolute nonsense. The current limit is £125k, so it will help many many more people than ‘London’ as you put it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely love this man. Go Boris!!!! Completely floored Starmer there. BUILD BUILD BUILD. JOBS JOBS JOBS. #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think @BorisJohnson nailed #PMQs, making @Keir_Starmer look absolutely pathetically weak &amp; out of his depth. @RishiSunak then nailed the #SummerStatement &amp; stunned a weak Labour Party with huge help to protect jobs, as well as stamp duty cuts, 5% VAT cut and a #PlanForJobs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LukeBrandonUK He needs to get people in the pubs and restaurants again. It’s an incentive. Too many people aren’t going.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the Labour Welsh Government don’t open up pubs and restaurants soon, the Welsh economy will disintegrate and people will lose their jobs. People also won’t be able to take advantage of the huge things the @Conservatives are doing for the hospitality industry. #SummerStatement<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The @Conservatives are absolutely smashing this #SummerStatement. Protecting jobs and getting us all back spending again. Thanks @RishiSunak, brilliant chancellor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. Thank you @Conservatives and @RishiSunak. This is amazing news. #SummerStatement<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So deaths are now lower than the average for this time of year. Incredibly positive &amp; should encourage people to start going out more &amp; spending money again.

<|startoftext|>@ghost_wales Mate, I feel your pain. Drakeford is a wet fish and couldn’t manage the Welsh economy to literally save thousands of jobs. Disgraceful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatcheriteLee Mate, it’s got so much worse last month or so. It’s ridiculous now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it me or have the BBC now just morphed into a Labour Party political broadcast? The biased nature of their reporting and the inaccuracies in what they say, is off the scale.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see they are all at it again today, hyperventilating over anything negative they possiblly can, whilst tweeting the pathetic #BorisHasFailedTheNation. A mixture of deluded nasty lefties &amp; a biased, negative ‘fake news’ media, has stoked up more divide in this country than ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely right Dan. It’s just an excuse for the left and media to attack Boris and get hyped up over. They absolutely love it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fmwales Get a grip of the Welsh economy as a priority ffs. People’s livelihoods are at stake. A statue or a street name is not the priority. Same old Labour playing politics, rather than making a difference to the lives of the many. Shameful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Completely unacceptable to not be given an interview becuase you are not BAME. That’s racism in itself, against white people, and does not fit with the equality which we all want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w24holden @PaulBrandITV @OpiniumResearch It would have been going for 6 months. There’s still another few months left now. I don’t think it’s realistic to keep it going beyond October if the jobs are going to be lost anyway. It’s not affordable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulBrandITV @OpiniumResearch No point extending it further if those jobs are going to go regardless. The idea is it keeps them in jobs until the economy is opened up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlieDinkin £1.57 billion of funding announced for the arts by the @Conservatives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is something about @BorisJohnson that is just so warm and mood lifting. He can literally light up a room and fill it with energy and enthusiasm. He isn’t the typical politician, but he is such a great leader. This is just what we need as a country right now.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RRichardsonyt Melt (me being polite)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ITVNewsPolitics @itvnews @Keir_Starmer Absolute bollocks. They were already doing certain measures, which just didn’t have enough impact, hence full lockdown. Labour have a go about everything, just becuase they have nothing better to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Wales will do the same then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. She really is cracking down. Law and order with the @Conservatives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But still no date from Labour as to when pubs and restaurants in Wales can open inside. We all know that so many can’t afford to open otherwise, especially with the British weather. This simply isn’t enough. All other nations have given a date, step up to the mark for once Labour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon Stop lying. The Government have/are recruiting police officers. They are not cutting police. I’m sick to death of Labour politicians lying, because that’s all they can do to attack.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jessphillips Oh get stuffed. This Government has saved millions of jobs and has reacted as quickly as possible to a global pandemic.

<|startoftext|>When are the MSM ever accurate these days?!? Anybody know? 🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GuyOpperman So sad, thoughts are with you and the family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too late<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BridgendCBC Lying it seems, typical Labour Council. I said of exceptional circumstances and you refused to take more than 2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ghost_wales See you there mate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlanOverment @SusanEacock @BorisJohnson I’m just laughing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think this could work rather well in America.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanEacock @BorisJohnson She’s having a breakdown no doubt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well folks, the deadline for an extension to the Brexit transition period has now expired. Boris &amp; the Government flatly refused to extend, keeping their promise.   The transition period will end on 31 December &amp; we will be an independent nation, ending freedom of movement. 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s ok if Labour break lockdown rules though, isn’t it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UKLabour Damning?! Since when did you ever take Teresa May seriously? You never did, yet now this her words are gospel 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Martinr04612310 Nope. But it’s shocking they never learn to respect the ppl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour may have a new leader, but it’s quite clear they still want to deny the will of the British people. @Keir_Starmer was the Labour Shadow #Brexit Secretary before, where he proved he was against what the public voted for. You can’t trust @UKLabour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BOOM 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Neil_Skinner @dickyadams @SocialM85897394 Well if you’re gunna live there, you should at least speak and understand the basics yea.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jolilford @AndrewRTDavies @WelshGovernment Considering wales hasn’t opened much at all, it’s got a pretty high R rate. The economic consequences are going to be extremely high too, which will impact people’s health.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SocialM85897394 If you can’t speak or understand basic English, then you shouldn’t live in England. It’s kinda important to understand key messages from the Government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anybody watching snowpiercer? Absolutely love it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andras190 @debrakidd Thanks ever so much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andras190 @debrakidd Becuase Leicester has a very high proportion of black and ethnic people, they are vulnerable to covid and they were the ones mostly attending the protests. It’s not rocket science!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JandJNaylor Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatcheriteLee 🤞🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@debrakidd Not currently....not that it has anything to do with things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s what you get when you don’t vote Conservative, don’t avoid BLM protests and don’t socially distance, Leicester 👀 #leicesterlockdown  https://t.co/RtitvVZ6y5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Leicester being locked down again. High proportion of black people there, maybe BLM protests weren’t helpful there... 🤷🏼‍♂️ #leicesterlockdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @GMB  https://t.co/IjIwnRW7qp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Couldn’t make it up ay? That’s Labour for you. Untrustworthy and incompetent at the highest level.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>State of Labour 👇🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Afraid of their own shadow. Don’t like change. Can’t move on. 🥱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidLammy Labour shouldn’t have mismanaged money so badly then it sold off out gold on the cheap<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same old Labour. Starmer is just pandering yet again to the left and unions, whilst trying to tell us mere folk (when it suits) that he’s supportive of schools reopening and has always wanted children back in school. Shows that you still can’t trust Labour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the fuck is this? The countryside is a white environment?! I’ve heard everything now. Beyond a joke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think all the lefty remainiacs are going to have a complete meltdown soon. Civil Service reform, remain elites being removed, such as Mark Sedwill, DFID abolished, Brexit extension rejected and Cummings still in post. LOVE IT. #DrainTheSwamp #GlobalBritain 🇬🇧  https://t.co/aY0jeYCTXN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulBrandITV Absolutely amazing. So proud of what Boris and Cummings are doing. BREXIT is taking over the Civil Service.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like @BorisJohnson and Dominic Cummings are clearing out the remain elites at the top of the Civil Service and replacing them with top Brexiteers. This is not the first one pushed out. This is quite something, showing the huge reform. Absolutely love it. #DrainTheSwamp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. Brexit people taking over. Love it! 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great to have an MP finally sticking up for Bridgend. Another example of the media elite and their inaccurate and fake claims. Thanks @JamieWallisMP, keep up the good work. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great stuff, keep it up. It’s trash anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do @TUIUK never reply to DMs these day. They are a company with customers, that means they need to provide customer service. Something they seem to be forgetting during this pandemic. Sort it out, fed up of #badcustomerservice from TUI.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go @pritipatel 💙🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just love these guys together. I know that this country will come through everything, brexit transition will end, and our economy will get back on track and start to boom, with these two firmly in control. Boris and Rishi 💙🇬🇧 #sundayvibes #marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. Clapham Common looking nice and clean for people to enjoy today. No excuse for this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great stuff. Boris finally getting his election promises and domestic agenda back on track after Covid-19. Keep pushing forward ⁦@BorisJohnson⁩, you’re doing a great job in unprecedented times. #Marr #Ridge #SundayBrunch #ConservativeGoals 🇬🇧   https://t.co/V8bXwlnUUT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disgusted. I’m the biggest party goer, but people are taking the piss now. Could mean the loss of more lives &amp; a surge in covid cases, like they’re seeing in USA. That will mean we are locked down again, barely after the pubs have re-opened. People need to grow the fuck up. #Marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joey_tea It’s not fine in the slightest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EllisCole_ Lovely club<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson @pizzapilgrims Keep up the good work on re-opening Boris. Shame Wales is playing politics on this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Errrr, no you won’t. It’s against democracy, which the UK is built upon. You have zero chance and this only makes you look like a complete melt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaronStrucker @Suse_Susie Disgusting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Survation Hardly much of a change<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon This doesn’t let you off the hook in London<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGov This is balmy. A lot has changed since 1990.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fmwales You’ve barely eased anything in Wales, as currently you still can’t travel more than 5 miles. God gods sake, open the Welsh economy up. You’re causing this by not doing so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@londoncatz1990 @BorisJohnson SNP run Scotland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m disgusted by how many sick and twisted individuals there seem to be in this country at the moment. Far too much violence and vandalism out there at the moment. The sheer thuggery and desire to hurt people by so many, is deeply disturbing. The police need to crack down harder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad he’s been shot. Doesn’t deserve a life. LIVE: Suspect shot at scene of Glasgow attack, police say | UK News | Sky News  https://t.co/83Il4dEFqG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNewsBreak Not another violent occasion. It’s getting ridiculous now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon Rather than attacking Government, actually start doing your job, which at present, you are failing miserably at. Brixton can be your starting point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s nothing about BLM to these people. The BLM movement is politically hard-left, allowing thugs to use it an an excuse for reckless &amp; thuggish behaviour. The law needs to come down HARD on these individuals in Brixton or we will face this far too often. #LawAndOrder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SackKhan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon You have pandered to these very people, allowing them to become extremely confident to run rampage through London. This is your fault.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the fuck is @SadiqKhan and the @metpoliceuk chief doing? The longer the Government allows these incompetent people to let these thugs run riot, the more respect people will lose for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Government shouldn’t strip @SadiqKhan of his Mayor title and take over. He’s clearly not up to the job and the events in Brixton are just the final nail, in a very battered coffin. He’s shown himself up to be completely ignorant and incomeptent. #London #Brixton<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is wrong with these people?! Absolute scum. Violence, vandalism and disorder like this, especially in the middle of a pandemic should face severe consequences for the individuals involved. I have no doubt all these individuals in Brixton attended the violent BLM protests...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s #Brexit for you. #BOOM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @TomSwarbrick1 Plain wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Deal is dead then 🖕🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think lockdown has made me fat 🙈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattforde No wonder your a comedian, best joke so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Standard Labour incompetence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Diddums<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Proud to be British? Back Boris? #RT 👇🏼#PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanEacock I’m going to try for that week, mines a huge birds nest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another thumping and energetic performance by @BorisJohnson at #PMQs today. His energy definitely coming back and his British spirit showing once more. He makes @Keir_Starmer look far too wooden and very scripted. Even his scripts aren’t accurate, but he’ll please the lefties.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Germany does not have an effective contact tracing app. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EllisCole_ Get to work!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GPhillips10 @talkRADIO @JuliaHB1 Lots of schools are already open, but we would be going into the schools holidays soon anyway. Very negative aren’t you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @kayles_96 Bollocks. If millions of jobs are lost, and people are plunged into financial ruin, that will effect peoples mental health. Also, without unlocking, many others will die by being too scared to go to the docs or hospital when they should. It’s a balanced risk, and is needed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What’s all this #NeverSpoons stuff all over Twitter about? Nothing better than a night in Wetherspoons with good mates and cheap booze. Bring on the messy times!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewRTDavies @WelshGovernment It’s Labour, I wouldn’t expect anything but incompetence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now this, I would love! I’d even buy the guy a pint myself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peston Don’t need a daily update on the economy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeAnnable Clearly not confident<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeAnnable It can also more easily spread in water as saliva infects it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely love Boris.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It looks like 4th of July is going to be a good day. #PubsReopening<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The 2m social distancing rule has been reduced to 1m from July 4th. Pubs, cafes, restaurants and hairdressers all to open on the same date. Excellent news. #PubsReopening #BorisSpeech<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A #whitelivesmatter banner in Burnley seems to have caused more outrage amongst all the lefties on twitter, than somebody slaughtering people in a park. People who have been rioting &amp; shouting at police for weeks, now begging the police to investigate. Pathetic. #ALLLIVESMATER<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let’s get the British pubs back in action. 🇬🇧🍻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hugh_pimple @ChrisButterfie3 Too right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With the #heatwave ☀️ starting today, I really wish the good ol British beer garden was open. A nice cold cider or wine in the sun, with the roar &amp; laughter of everyone around you enjoying the sun...miss those days! Let’s hope for an amazingly sunny British July! 🇬🇧 🥃🍸🍻🍹🍷 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Completely agree👇🏼. Things will bounce back quicker than people think, I’m sure of it. Fully in support of Boris right now. He will get the economy fired up &amp; back on track, as well as giving a mega push on trade deals around the globe. 🇬🇧 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gavgall91 I think BLM have missed the point now. At the beginning it was a show of solidarity, it’s now nothing to do with that. It’s just political attacks, violence, nastiness, rewriting history and creating divide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely loved Big Brother 3. Such a great year, with so many huge personalities. Brings back memories of watching it in the early hours of the morning, with school the next day. Great times #BBUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbclaurak It’s the bank, not the PMs fault.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What planet are Labour on? The economy has just shrunk by 20% due to being in lockdown for 3 months. That is certainly not the right thing to do for economic recovery. More jobs and businesses would be lost. THIS is why Labour are not allowed near @10DowningStreet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iromg Keep triggering, it’s the highlight of my days 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Support @BorisJohnson, back the economic recovery, stand proud to be British and fight back against the poisonous, nasty far-left idiots in this country.  🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scary in fact how many people are influenced by the media. You’d think by now nobody would trust the media with all the fake news, inaccuracies in reporting and blatant bias.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At the end of the day, if our economy needs more money &amp; investment is critically needed here post covid-19, some of the foreign aid budget has to be redirected back to the UK. I’m glad to see positive indications from the Government that this will happen. Britain is priority 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drjamain @Linda36758099 @BorisJohnson I know the data thanks very much, but it isn’t compatible with many other countries who are either increasing at a much faster rate now, or haven’t released accurate data yet (aka Italy). I could say your ignorance shames you, but hey ho. Have a nice day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drjamain @Linda36758099 @BorisJohnson Now I know you’re off your head. To throw things like the economy out, when we have been in a pandemic is ridiculous. The UK Government has done more for the economy than any other country, inc paying the wages of many on furlough scheme. Hatred has clouded your vision. Shame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drjamain @Linda36758099 @BorisJohnson Harm to what? He’s following the experts relating to covid, so do explain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Linda36758099 @BorisJohnson Boris is doing a lot. They have different roles, and Boris is perfect where he is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EllisCole_ That’s ridiculous. That would have been 2 years since you booked nearly. They should have just postponed a year. By moving it 6 month, and now a year, it’s just so far away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EllisCole_ @pussycatdolls Is it moved then? Bad times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan ‘Worrying’. You’d be going absolutely nuts if that was the UK and would be blaming it all on @BorisJohnson and the Government. Your double standards are clear to most. You have a clear agenda and a false narrative that you try spinning most days. It’s pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Suse_Susie @BorisJohnson Massively disagree. A LOT going on behind the scenes on civil service reform, getting rid of DFID, Brexit, making sure transition ends this year, more laws etc. He also has this pandemic to deal with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Late to the party on this, but good on @BorisJohnson. Drain the swamp.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NWJK @MarcCorbishley Clearly no taste 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcCorbishley Yes yes yes 🤤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know what to do👇🏼  https://t.co/MyJ080H7dO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People like Khairi Saadallah make me sick. At least with a Conservative Government, you know if changes to the law are needed,@BorisJohnson &amp; @pritipatel will take action, as they did to end Labours automatic early release of terrorist offenders. Need to get tougher. #LawAndOrder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitDoor Sums it up pretty well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Not quite as simple as that and you know it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope Khairi Saadallah is severely punished. Far too many violent extremists come into this great country and are given the freedom to wreak havoc. They are scum, no other word for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be a day of celebration in itself. The remainiacs lost and @BorisJohnson has taken control. No doubt we’ll hear a lot of noise from some over the next few days.... 🇬🇧 🇬🇧  Bring on 31 December. Our own laws, waters, border control, money and trade deals around the globe.  ❤️🤍💙<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR It’s coming @EssexPR. It will happen on 4th July no doubts about it. Announcement will come this week confirming it, along with the reduction on 2m rule. We’ve always know it wouldn’t be before 4th, so not sure why everyone is pushing it right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sean_antrim @SkyNewsBreak Not easy to prevent if some lone nutcase goes out and stabs people. What can be done is severe punishment, which I have no doubt will happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gabby_Price98 They’re not unrelated, may not be directly, but I’d definitely say indirectly related. The BLM movement in the UK has turned hugely political and massively divisive, the opposite of what it was meant to achieve.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevec3457 @MouldsSylvia In a flash. So much more to come from Boris, once this pandemic is over. He’s already delivering on things like Brexit, refusing to extend transition, merging Giv Departments etc etc. Glad to have Dom by his side too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Quizbay Sure thing, quicker than they can pull my pint.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Starrygem4 I think it’s critical we all still use twitter and bring the fight to Labour on here as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Powerful rally so far<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SocialM85897394 🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BBradley_Mans @parler_app Depends if you follow me on twitter 😂 A few MPs, but not you...letting me down Ben...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m on Parler @kevinedge1639 though I have no frigging idea how to work it... 🤣🙈🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Terrorist lives certainly do not matter. This is Britain, you will not win. 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 #ForburyGardens<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gabby_Price98 I don’t deny they worked with the police, but the police arnt policing properly. It is against the law to protest with larger than 6 people. Laws were past this week. Suggest you look it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gabby_Price98 Protesting at the moment isn’t legal actually. I suggest you look at new laws that were passed this week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whether these ‘Black Lives Matter’ protests at Forbury Gardens were peaceful or not, they were ILLEGAL. The Police need to start actually making crime pay. Illegal is illegal. Also, if the media hadn’t hyped the BLM issue, then racial tensions wouldn’t be so heightened #reading<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexCanning Well, we already have @WetherspoonsTA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JWILDER82551815 Nope. @kevinedge1639<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ApsaalookeLady Literally<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan I’m with Dom. #TeamRaab<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robbie_ws The issue is that people like the Labour London Mayor have too much control over things, as well as Councils.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarolHambelton Same. I’ll look another day haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are Arsenal going to have any players left after all these injuries last few days. Yikes. #BHAARS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sooperparents One that needs abolishing ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is #NoRoomForRacism but that goes for all types of racism, something the rabble on the left need to understand. They can’t preach racism, when they are the nastiest, most divisive, ignorant &amp; poisonous of all. I’m proud of British history &amp; nobody will convince me otherwise<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Loving the cardboard cut outs of actual Brighton fans. Gave me a chuckle. #BHAARS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetPoliceEvents @MPSWestminster @CRoperMPS @TfLTrafficNews What is the point of making it illegal for protests of more than 6 people, if the Met Police and @SadiqKhan do nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JWILDER82551815 Just joined, but need to figure out I’m how to use the thing 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattPolo2493 It’s not just about the economy. It’s about lives lost due to people under too much strain, not going to hospital, suicide rates going up. Excess deaths are no higher than this time in June any other year now. Therefore, it’s the right time to reduce the 2m rule.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveRooney16 MPs 😝🤣 oh no wait....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why we should not pander to it or all the leftie virtue signalling loons. It’s a political movement, pure and simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m glad there is a review of 2m rule. It’s likely to be cut to 1m in the next couple of weeks, which is the right decision after the progress we have made against this pandemic. Education, peoples jobs, financial stability, mental health, they are all critical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattPolo2493 Peoples lives are in danger if millions lose their jobs, can’t get back to normal etc. It’s not just about coronvirus now, it’s about mental heath, financial stability, education etc now. If you can’t see that, then there’s no hope for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👀👀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is #CelebrityGogglebox better than the normal version?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrAndyNgo Disgusting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rosehip101 Tell me about it! Feel your pain 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ziva2010 I stuck with it, but thought it was pretty appalling. It was just constant political BLM rhetoric and then they’re all on their knees. Football shouldn’t be like this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hearing news that an announcement on the opening of pubs, restaurants and hairdressers, with a reduction to 1m, will be made next week. Please be true. My life is in your hands Boris 🙏🏼  Need a chop and a good ol British pint 🍺 🍻🍺 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cadcro No match for us true Brits!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darrengrimes_ Well, the loony Labour lefties aren’t really in the real world are they<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hendopolis @BorisJohnson Government locked down when their scientists and medical experts told them too. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on Spurs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I find this extremely disgusting and unacceptable language👇🏼. It doesn’t shock me coming from @DawnButlerBrent or Labour in general, but highly unprofessional, false and inappropriate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawnButlerBrent This isn’t acceptable language at all. I’m not surprised from Labour, but it is not right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FedFin090 We should do everything like this. Planes, cars, busses, taxis, trains 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TallulahSparkl1 @Jackson78504183 Makes my blood boil sometimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has anybody else noticed that all these footballers seem to have very professional looking haircuts? 🤔 Mine looks like a scruffy birds nest in comparison.... 😔 #TOTMUN #NORSOU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rodbishop15 Aruba please 🙏🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnneTow84880951 It’s ridiculous. It’s not about BLM anymore, it’s seriously political<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turn on the football for some escapism and to watch #TOTMUN.... what do I see...a ‘Party Political Broadcast’ by the political movement that is BLM. Can we not have this every single game please. It’s getting ridiculous. The message is now lost as it’s become far too political.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think this is dangerous. Defunding the police is not the answer, ever. For companies to be tweeting this sort of rhetoric, is extremely concerning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrbluesky99 @AlanMas96895371 I hope so. Will people remember though?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EllisCole_ Really?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Big game tonight. Who’s going to win? #TOTMUN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@James_farmer83 @ukJ0N So what do you think they did wrong? What advice to you think they followed or didn’t follow then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulBrandITV Shame the media arn’t as good at asking questions. Then again, the public don’t have an agenda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good man. Boris, on the side of the people. 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@James_farmer83 @ukJ0N Easily. So much out there is inaccurate. The Government has followed all scientific and medical experts. Things can always be done better, but they have followed the experts. The riots, well, people should take responsibility and not be breaking the law<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EuroGuido #DespiteBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheOnlyKoray @timmyvoe @britainelects @RedfieldWilton 18 was never going to be sustainable with the media onslaught of inaccurate reporting daily. The key thing is, they are still ahead and increasing their lead now, after the worst of the pandemic is over. Only way is up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon Oh get stuffed and sort London’s issues out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The UK is so much better off having @BorisJohnson as it’s PM. So proud of what he’s done so far and what he plans to do in the future. A strong leader facing unprecedented times, but with the British public at his heart. A massive Happy Birthday Boris 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s one thick banana and one fussy animal!! 🍌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤣 Haha!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy Birthday Boris - you have the country behind you 🇬🇧❤️🤍💙🇬🇧  https://t.co/ig2Me6AhmQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RuleBrexitannia Definitely not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Katiewhiteexo @davidgrimeslufc @BorisJohnson @SadiqKhan Britain only really exists today because of our past. Back then, if you didn’t do that, then you wouldn’t have existed today. We wouldn’t have been rich enough to fund the war etc. We can’t judge back then on a 21 century view of right and wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the actual fuck are Labour on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are the UK the worst in the world on all this virtue signalling? It’s crackers. And completely out of control now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SalouSenora @DominicRaab Try listening again. Regardless, the main sentiment was bang on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@saminarush Oh you mean for travelling to Durham, when he didn’t break the guidelines or break social distancing? 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanEacock @BorisJohnson Dream team: @DominicRaab @BorisJohnson @pritipatel @MattHancock @RishiSunak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@saminarush Ferguson also resigned from SAGE but while he was still there, the week before lockdown (13 March) at a SAGE meeting, there was unanimous decision by all that lockdown should not happen yet. Therefore, he was lying on at least one of those occasions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two of the most vocal sensible voices around at the moment. Definitely a must listen👇🏼 @Iromg @CatharineHoey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bendashper You do realise we are in the middle of a pandemic, therefore things like the furlough scheme are critical. If it was up to Labour, they have everyone permanently on furlough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@saminarush The scientists and medical experts said not to lock down a week earlier, what don’t you get?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The worst thing #London could do is vote for this Labour Mayor again next year. Dreadful on sorting crime, doesn’t stick to his promises, incompetent with money, arrogant, virtue signalling, and very anti-british. Can’t think of any reason to vote for him 🤷🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrGABaines Thought it was renamed Party Polticial Broadcast by the Loony Labour Party. Wouldn’t go near #BBCQT anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darrengrimes_ You’ve not seen mine mate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe they think it’s #Brexit all over again....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let’s hope that it strengthens the Government. Refreshing to see such honestly, esp with all the virtue signalling we see from the left.  The public are behind Raab &amp; Boris, let’s make sure they know it. Brexit, trade deals, Union Jack flag on the plane, keep it coming. #bbcqt 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrugesGroup @CatharineHoey Surprised she stayed with Labour as long as she did. Definitely worth a follow yup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely ridiculous that in 2020, we can’t rely on @BBCNews to report accurately or inform us of actual news. Shameful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sick of all the nasty, virtue signalling Labour lefties all over twitter. All they do is put Britain down, slag off the Government &amp; Boris, petition to rewrite our culture, history &amp; our statues, whilst spreading inaccurate stories. Who agrees? Follow and fight back. 🇬🇧🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PippaCrerar He hasn’t back peddled at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson @EmmanuelMacron @10DowningStreet ❤️🤍💙<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheyPlayTheHits @RockboltG @ancoatsmcrz They haven’t mismanaged it. They’ve been trialling they one, and that has flaws, as does the apple one. Hence why they are looking at combining elements of the two to make a bespoke one. I think that’s clearly better than chucking a useless ineffective app out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RockboltG Nope, just banging on about u turns on the app, which isn’t true. So same garbage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PippaCrerar Track and trace isn’t just the app. Track and trace went live on June 1. Fake news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anna_Soubry The only embarrassment, is that you were once part of the @Conservatives Party. I am damn proud of @DominicRaab and his honesty. He speaks for the majority of the country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarrySheerman @BBCr4today Oh well, life’s a bitch ain’t it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After Dominic Raab stated he wouldn’t take the knee for the BLM movement, would you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So proud that Dominic Raab said what he said. Far too many are afraid to say what they feel, for fear of being called a racist. Taking the knee is a personal choice, but in my opinion, it’s often virtue signalling &amp; suggests the opposite to the supposed message. 🇬🇧 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jameslw_CA @RichHunterDrums @britainelects @KantarPublic Scrutiny? As if. The media are very biased in their reporting and often do not report accurately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Minderbinder12 @britainelects @KantarPublic Says a couple of eggs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@talkRADIO Agreed with it. Too many people are afraid to say what they think, for fear of the left and media calling them racist.  It’s an individual choice, but in my opinion, it gives the wrong message and suggests the opposite regarding equality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jackethomp @britainelects @KantarPublic With an 8 point lead, having gone through the worst of the media onslaught? I don’t think so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@britainelects @KantarPublic A drop from 51 for the Tories was inevitable after the media onslaught of fake news. It’s only 3 down from general elelction, which is pretty remarkable considering how much the media and left have gone for them. I’d not be surprised if as we move on, their lead goes back up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sylviamcc123 Couldn’t exactly say no<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrMasonMills 👏🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theoVanGog @uk8qnzl @DominicRaab He said he wouldn’t take the knee for this BLM movement, in answer to the question posed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuanckersGhost @DominicRaab He didn’t, but making it crystal clear to all the lefties and dimwits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uk8qnzl @DominicRaab He is, and he’s been clear he wouldn’t take the knee. He’s been honest, and I think that’s applaudable. Far too many people are too scared to say anything, for fear of being called a racist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree with Dominic Raab - taking the knee I think seems to have the opposite message. It doesn’t seem to suggest equality to me and I wouldn’t do it. Well done Raab in being honest, I’m sure the majority agree with you on this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidLammy I agree with Dom. It gives the wrong message in my opinion, almost like the opposite to what the message is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We owe a lot to everyone back then, not just Dame Vera Lynn but all of those who not only served in the war, but also helped back in the UK in the war efforts. We should be proud of what Britain did back then. She did a great job of keeping the nation positive, #RIPVeraLynn. 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieHBNews Wtf. The Government have been trying too, while facility opposition from Labour, Councils and the unions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love the positivity of this man 👇🏼 Keep up the good work @ProfKarolSikora, we must look at the progress we are making to push us further forward.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FIRST GOAL!!! #PremierLeagueIsBack<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Souts_Alivand Minor things. The big things will go through. Cummings and Boris will get all the major stuff done, plane painted, DFID horn, brexit delivered, trade deals all over, civil service re-org. Gotta be patient<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad we can finally agree on something 😉 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had a hefty bet on Black Lives Matter scoring the first goal of the #PremierLeague, thought my chances were good, but based on what I’ve seen so far, it’s not looking good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Arsenal not having the best start. Going to run out of players soon....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bad bad decision. This is not the way to move forwards. I hope his funded scholarship stops too then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First game in months, and no goals. #dissapointed #AVLSHU  https://t.co/EATIhKCRzg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OlwynHope @LuTeamDom @BorisJohnson @Keir_Starmer 👌🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love the fact that #footballsback, especially the #PremierLeague. HOWEVER, all the constant talk of ‘Black Lives Matter’, it being on the shirts, all the players kneeling, I feel it spoils it. It makes it far too political, which is not what football is about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on Villa, I have a bet on.  #AVLSHU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @MattHancock It was literally seconds. Grow up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IVShaddam @connorwebster98 @YouGov Our scientists and medical experts. I do expect it to change tho soon, as cases go even lower<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan The advertising will bring in more money than it costs. That’s how these things work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGov I’m surprised at this, considering millions of jobs rely on it being reduced to 1m. Either way, it will be reduced to 1m within weeks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PippaCrerar It’s advertising global Britain to the world, so yea it is. Do you not know how advertising works?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @BorisJohnson @Keir_Starmer Labour are shit, just have to look at Wales to see the distance of what happens when Labour are in charge. Schools not open, shops not open, zoos not open. Not even a schedule of when things will open. If Labour were in Government, we’d all be fuc*ed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. It’s to show off a new sovereign independent Britain. It’s advertising at the end of the day, for a ‘Global Britain’. British and proud. 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The media focus constantly on free school meal vouchers during summer hols, but bizarrely barely mention anything about the unprecedented fact, that this Conservative Government decided to pay the wages of over 9m workers, whilst also providing grants and business loans 🙄 #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@W0llyams The main thing it shows is the opposition don’t have a firm opinion on something, and is lacking leadership. They can’t work effectively like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@roundface40 @BorisJohnson @Keir_Starmer And he answered them. If the leader of the opposition doesn’t have a firm opinion on schools reopening, it’s quite worrying and shows a lack of leadership. I’d expect nothing less from Labour though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think @BorisJohnson absolutely smashed #PMQs. He made @Keir_Starmer look pathetically incompetent. Well done Boris, we’re all behind you in these difficult times. 🇬🇧 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkRic86059743 @AnnIrvin13 Yup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have to admit, I’ve quite missed the #PremierLeague football and doing all my weekly bets. So glad #footballsback today. Nice cold pint! Football is definitely coming home... ⚽️ #backofthenet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickeardleybbc @SadiqKhan Considering he’s absolutely shit at his job, he should be taking a much bigger cut than that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg, just catching up on #BBUK. Fuck me Nikki and Grace were childish brats. Though I remember I did find it absolutely hilarious at the time to watch 😂 🤣😂🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCNews @AllieHBNews Starving kids? We’re still in term time, therefore, people never stopped getting free school meals. So what kids are starving? Another lefty rag lying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCNews @AllieHBNews Not really true is it. As Rashford himself said, neither of them had to do what they did. So it’s not point scoring, unless you’re a lefty rag or lefty twat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @GMB @MattHancock Matts got better things to do than attempt to talk to you, while you shout all over him while not listening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GenQuarry @susannareid100 They haven’t dropped 18 points, their lead has dropped. We are going through a pandemic and there is a lot of negativity around, even though he’s followed the experts. Also, it was Education dpt that refused, when he got involved he changed it. Do get your facts correct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoPradista @HHrocknroll @darrengrimes_ There are many other financial support available, it’s not just one thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GenQuarry @susannareid100 You assume wrong. And the response came today, as promised. His advisors a bit thick? Oh yes, so thick they got him an 80 majority. I think it’s you that’s thick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexCanning Disagree. There are other financial support that parents get, such as child tax credit. Free School meals are just that, school means, term only. This can’t be a permanent thing. Absolutely not. The state would effectively be financing that child completely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not so secret now then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fzjmmd @BBradley_Mans @MarcusRashford There are other area of financial support, so it’s not simply they would starve without it at  all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These are some of the major important things the Conservative Government are doing to help those in need. Millions of wages are being paid by the Government, which helps to #feedthekids &amp; get people through this. It’s not just about #FreeSchoolMeals. #DowningStreetBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mi6Not @Deedy2201 @emilyhewertson 👍🏼 So lame and pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peston It’s not a game. If he didn’t listen you’d say he lost, if he’s does, you say he’s weak as he u turned. Boring now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer Economy contracted due to lockdown. It will bounce back. Stop trying to use coronavirus as a political issue, it’s a global pandemic which Boris has been listening to the scientific and medical experts on. The UK has provided unprecedented financial support, inc paying wages<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@susannareid100 He doesn’t spend al day in twitter, he’s a busy man. A spokesman said yesterday that the PM would respond today, doesn’t mean they told him yesterday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbclaurak He’s a bit busy to be on twitter all day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@one_spongey @KarinaTranmer @emilyhewertson That’s not what I said, so don’t bother trying to make out I did. The Conservative Government has done tons to support people, the biggest being getting people off unemployment into employment. I have no doubt they will get us through coronavirus and we will see that again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 The issue I have is when parents have multiple children, when they know they can’t afford them. They then rely on the state.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DetectiveCorona @emilyhewertson Sometimes people get into difficulty and are struggling, hence there were other schemes available for parents to get financial support. It’s simply not true to say that without this one thing, there would be no food. It’s never happened in the summer before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@one_spongey @emilyhewertson The Living Wage is making sure that wages have continued to go up under the Tories. Before Coronavirus, there were also more ppl in employment than ever before. Also, the Government funding school meals through the summer is also a ‘scheme’.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@one_spongey @emilyhewertson There are plenty of other schemes available as well, so it’s simply not accurate to say kids wouldn’t have access to food if the parents couldn’t feed the kids they had.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EwanClark94 @emilyhewertson Exactly. And people say it’s the ‘pandemic’, but yet more people are employed now than under the last Labour Government, so that’s not true. 9m workers are being paid on furlough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyhewertson We will turn into a benefit state country again, like under Labour. Twitter can’t be what creates the narrative or dictates policy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More people are now employed than under the last Labour Government, whilst 9m paid on furlough. Free schools meals have never been done before during school holidays. So what’s the diff now? There are also other financial support schemes available for the most vulnerable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@antonycotton So... Footballer says that kids should get free meals during the summer = moral fibre &amp; backbone.  Prime minister pays wages of 9m ppl, provides grants, business loans &amp; other financial support = no moral fibre and backbone 🙄 You clearly cant see past your lefty anti Tory fog.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TameenaHussain @antonycotton Well I suggest you look at the schemes the Government has put place to avoid that situation. The Government has been paying grants and 9 million ppl their wages, yet that isn’t mentioned by people like @antonycotton. There are also other financial schemes for providing meals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@antonycotton @coopuk I note that when the Government introduced the furlough scheme, which pays the wages of 9 million people, therefore helping millions of households keep putting food on the table, you’re silent. Now very vocal on this and praising one person. Your anti Tory bias is ugly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@antonycotton @TameenaHussain The Government is paying the wages of 9 million workers, providing bounce back loans, grants and tax relief to keep businesses going under as well as individual financial support to the vulnerable. Your tweet isn’t accurate, just purely political of your anti Gov bias. Grow up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This should help with #schoolmeals4summer, @MarcusRashford<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If @MarcusRashford’s mum had 5 children &amp; was unable to feed them or afford anything, why did she have so many kids? This Government is paying the wages of 9m ppl, providing bounce back loans, grants, tax relief &amp; other financial support. Yet, still not good enough for some.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plus the Government has already announced £63m for meals during the summer. Add in money raised by charity for this, it doesn’t leave much left for some rich celebs to drum up. The taxpayers are already funding hundreds of billions during cornona iris for things like furlough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wtf is this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧 Thanks for keeping your promise, Boris. 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’d support this.  https://t.co/aQ7GMbLYhj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @GMB Long may it continue. I look forward to the 149th day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNewsBreak Wtf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Usual lefty loons tweeting  #ihatejohnsonbecause is pathetic. Boris has faced more than any other PM since the war. He delivered #Brexit, he’s working on a trade deal, he’s refused to extend transition, he’s been following the scientists in this pandemic &amp; now dealing with BLM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amurray1876 Lying piece of work aren’t you. Not once has he ever said he was proud of all the deaths. If you think he did, source please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ianpuddick We know it was Russia. The UK intelligence Service concluded that and lots of evidence has come out since. If you’re trying to saying it wasn’t Russia, then you can get stuffed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the positive things we can remember from @theresa_may as PM, is her handling of the #SalisburyPoisonings. She did a great job when that happened and galvanised a coordinated response against Russia. Hats off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay! It’s @theresa_may 😂 #SalisburyPoisonings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time for a bit more of the #SalisburyPoisonings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardBurgon It’s not private profit though is it. Peoples jobs and businesses rely on it going down to 1m. Pubs can’t open otherwise and could go under, taking with it thousands of jobs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shock. Labour making a dogs dinner if the Welsh economy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Seafa11 @confidencenac That was the majority yes, though there were so thuggish far-right hitting police too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@francisobrienUK Same mate! Gagging<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lienomail He’s done plenty of other tweets condemning the far-left and everyone else. Yes I agree, it could have been clearer. However, if your somebody that was peacefully protecting a statue and never got violent, surely it’s obvious he’s not talking about you. He’s talking about thugs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wisheart12 Boris has said he wants a deal this summer. So where exactly has he said not deal? Oh that’s right, nowhere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lienomail It’s being taken wrong. When Boris spoke about some far right thugs, he wasn’t talking about peaceful veterans and other patriots who want to make a point about British culture and values. They are NOT the violent thugs that have been referred to, but an entirely separate group.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bankersreform @wendy_wingad He called them out last weekend. The issue is that the media have an agenda so don’t show things truthfully. Then, you rely on social media, but not everything gets seen or it can be taken the wrong way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeanniejuno He’s called at thugs being violent. If a person is peacefully protecting a statue, then clearly Boris isn’t talking about them. He’s been pretty clear in many tweets over the last few weeks. Some are misinterpreting the latest one as an attack on any body defending statues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Autumn___Rose @BorisJohnson You’re misinterpreting it. When Boris spoke about far right thugs, he wasn’t talking about peaceful veterans and other patriots who want to make a point about British culture and values. They are NOT the violent thugs that have been referred to, but an entirely separate group.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. Could be us in a few weeks...the again, it’ll probably rain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Boris condemned far-right thugs, he wasn’t talking about peaceful veterans and other patriots who want to make a point about British culture and values. They are NOT the violent thugs that have been referred to, but an entirely separate group. Let’s not lie about this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthea_bailey Do we know what’s happening about the people who have been arrested for other things? You don’t hear about anything else<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Labour Welsh Government is killing the Welsh economy &amp; it will affect lives. It’s making life extremely hard for people.

<|startoftext|>It’s becoming clear that the Labour Welsh Government doesn’t have a clue what it’s doing. No plan whatsoever for reopening the economy.

<|startoftext|>Friday we saw the economy shrink 20% in April - a huge loss.  Today, shops reopen and the comeback of our economy begins.

<|startoftext|>@DatabaseKing66 @MichelReuters Boris has already said the same in tweets. Tho the problem he has is that the ultimate responsibility for statues lies with specific Councils<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnpmpickering @MichelReuters Boris has basically said in tweets that no statues should be taken down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TiceRichard @Monty_London @BorisJohnson Boris has stated the same ffs. However, ultimate decisions come down to specific councils. Though Boris has said that no statues or monuments should come down. Stop trying to make political digs, when you know to be untrue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MechEngineerB BBC don’t seem to have any values anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GuidoFawkes As much as I agree what he did was wrong &amp; totally unacceptable, I also find it strange more emphasis is being put on charging him, rather than the actual evil thugs that beat so many people on Saturday.

<|startoftext|>@PeoplesParlour @Monicacoshow @kemenzerem @Channel4News But groups of black thugs chasing and beating white people isn’t doing much for the case against racism is it. It’s doing more damage.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Monicacoshow @kemenzerem @Channel4News If you’re talking about George Floyd, we know the answer. But the whole point of these BLM protests are to show solidarity, not beat white people up. Hardly sending a good message is it. So many white people were beaten by groups of black thugs. It spoils the message.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The media are still playing a narrative that is incorrect, re. #londonprotests. They say it was clashes between far-right &amp; ant-racism activists. How does that explain why so many ‘far-right’ white men were beaten by groups of black thugs? Those thugs clearly weren’t anti-racist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Monicacoshow @kemenzerem @Channel4News But who beat the white man? A group of black men. Hmm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kemenzerem @Channel4News If the injured man is ‘far-right’ as the media keep saying, doesn’t that mean it was ‘anti racists activists’ that caused him those injuries? Therefore, racists themselves and this not anti racist at all. To be saying there’s only two types protesting is a lie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrianKiddsMate2 @Ryyanx You’re disgusting. Should never celebrate somebody being hit with such force. People have died like that. Nobody should react with violence. The only person here who’s committed a crime if the black guy, which doesn’t do much for the BLM cause<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tzafinu Excuse to go to the beach and meet more than 5 friends<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pcf4 @cathynewman What makes him a racist? How do you know he didn’t just sit next to a statue all’s at with a drink. Very judgemental. And the question id like to know is who attacked him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cathynewman It’s a great thing what Patrick did and we need more people like that, but I don’t think we’re talking about the key thing here. Why was somebody needing to be rescued? Why was he being attacked? Was it because he was white? Let’s not concentrate on half the story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @RishiSunak Well he’s still a @Conservatives and is part of Government as our chancellor. He’s doing a brilliant job just where he is. May he remain there for a long time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has anybody thought of what could happen if Black Lives Matter started contesting elections....?! 🤔 A #BLM candidate could change a lot of seats, potentially stealing a lot of Labours core vote. Do you think BLM will put candidates into elections in the UK? Be interesting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent news that it’s basically halved. Hopefully tomorrow’s figures will be down on last Monday too. We are beating this. The emphasis should definitely now switch to economic recovery, whilst staying alert to the dangers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is especially true, now that @BorisJohnson &amp; the Government have confirmed there will be NO #Brexit transition extension. They have flatly refused to extend and that is how it should be. Let’s move forwards, not get stuck in limbo. Keep going Boris. 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧  https://t.co/BF1DJ4KOyJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@haynesey89 @SkyNewsBreak It’s half of what it was last Sunday. Get a grip. People will die of suicide and other illnesses more if we don’t continue to open up. Do shut up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNewsBreak A very positive sign. More people will start dying of other issues soon, so critical now to open up the economy. Shame Labour in Wales and SNP in Scotland arn’t starting to open up the economy again. This is vital for jobs, businesses and livelihoods.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Brexit Party for a long time now are more interested in a taste of power than anything else. The @Conservatives have been very firm this week on #Brexit. Despite the left pushing for an extension to the transition period, Tories have flatly rejected it. TBP need to pipe down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amazing to see things like this starting to happen again. People need to get back to normal &amp; the economy is vital to that. I really hope the likes of Wales follows @BorisJohnson in leading the way. Without the economy, public services can’t be funded &amp; ppl will lose their jobs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wbacurtis @NicolaSturgeon 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HomeTruths111 @anthea_bailey @BorisJohnson Agree completely. As PM he also has to try and look after and please the whole UK, that means satisfying all sections of the country and all divides. That’s a fine balance. Most politicians only have to please their core voters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomhfh He’s still the same nasty person inside, you don’t change that quickly. He’s just better at putting an act on, now that’s he’s in the shadow cabinet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DANIELMCAVOY9 @dazzer27manc27 The country is going through a pandemic and a lot of people are protesting because of black lives matter. The difference between Boris and Farage is Boris has to be the PM of the WHOLE UK, trying to look after and please everyone. Farage only has to please one section of the UK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SueWhitaker11 @MailOnline Tough. The UK is not run by extremists and so Winston Churchill will stay firmly where he is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon @hopenothate I’m concerned about left-wing extremism. Any advice for me? Pathetic mayor who can’t do the job he’s employed to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon @hopenothate To keep mentioning right-wing extremism, but ignore left-wing extremism is disingenuous and morally wrong. You call out all violence, even if those are your voters. This is purely political to you, which means you are no longer able to do your job effectively without bias #marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dominiquetaegon Probably want some far-lefty on to hammer home their agenda of portraying us all as far-right monsters 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let’s not forget, @RishiSunak &amp; this Conservative Government has done more for the UK than any other nation in terms of financing us through this pandemic. Over 8m people being paid on furlough, bounce back loans, business grants, &amp; tax relief. Britain will bounce back 🇬🇧 #Marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BathLabourParty @DavidLammy Inaccurate. It wasn’t 8 tweets about Winston Churchill. Try again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@talkRADIO Nope. A clear narrative and select agenda<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems that SNP @NicolaSturgeon wants zoos to go financial bust. There is no scientific or medical reason why a Scottish zoo should have to wait at least a month longer than an England zoo to open.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcCorbishley Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pritipatel @metpoliceuk Can we get individual updates on the people who vandalised last weeks memorials please. Also, what about the people who violently attacked individuals yesterday? You can’t focus on this and not others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaronJulekgrant @BorisJohnson When did Boris call you a hooligan? It never happened<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently a white person cant be on the receiving end of racism👇🏼 Complete ignorance. If a white person was attacked by a group of black thugs because they hated white ppl, that would be a racist attack. If ppl don’t think racism can be on both sides, you’re part of the problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PoppyCroton @SadiqKhan @BorisJohnson @pritipatel If I was attacked in the street by a gang of black people becuase I was white, that would be a racist attack. If you can’t understand that, you’re part of the problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PoppyCroton @SadiqKhan @BorisJohnson @pritipatel Racism can be against white people as well. FACT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sean_antrim @UKLabour Exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PoppyCroton @SadiqKhan @BorisJohnson @pritipatel I have yes, but I’ve seen more white people severely attacked, so what you’re saying I’m terms it’s more white people doing the attacking is factually wrong. Let’s just agree that all racism and violence is wrong, whatever side it comes from.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PoppyCroton @SadiqKhan @BorisJohnson @pritipatel Many of the white people violently attacked were on their own, and were attacked by groups. Any violence against anybody is out of order, but for you to say it was mostly white people doing it is a lie. The Government has called out all violence &amp; all racist thuggery<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Appalled by this. Violent clashes near Waterloo station  https://t.co/8qVTyvEPrZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PoppyCroton @SadiqKhan @BorisJohnson @pritipatel I do acknowledge there was violence from many different groups today, but I wouldn’t agree it was mostly white people at all. The majority of the most severely injured people today were white people. You can see that on social media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulSmyth2015 @SurferObserver @SadiqKhan @BorisJohnson @pritipatel I agree. All violence should be called out and justice served.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PoppyCroton @SadiqKhan @BorisJohnson @pritipatel It wasn’t mainly white people at all. Some of the most violent attacks were on white people, and last week was very much all BLM protesters. My account actually calls out ALL violence and racism, but it’s on both sides. I suggest you stop trying to peddle a clear agenda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Racism happens to many, not just black people. White people are also racially attacked, as we have seen in many videos &amp; pictures today, from the #londonriots. So many violent attacks on white people by BAME thugs. Let’s be clear that racism needs to be stamped out on all sides.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As @SadiqKhan is useless, over to you you @BorisJohnson @pritipatel. Make these scum pay. #londonriots<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope the criminals here are going to face the full force of the law, @pritipatel? This is disgusting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon You never call at left wing extremists, what the fuck is wrong with you?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NadiaWhittomeMP Last week wasn’t Black Lives Matter protects. They were far-left demonstrations. Typical Labour only calling out violence if it fits their narrative<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is disgusting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaylaMoran @BorisJohnson I didn’t see you calling out far-left thugs, especially after they injured police, hurt a horse and vandalised memorials. Shame on you. #londonprotests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarrenPlymouth @BorisJohnson Racism works both ways, so he’s saying it won’t be accepted either way, that includes against white people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t normally watch it, but I’m quite liking #ninjawarrioruk tonight. Maybe I just love watching people fall into water 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ll be happy when we can all go back to normal. Looking forward to going to the gym, concerts, parties and getting drunk in the pub again. Laying back and thinking about holidays is far better than watching these weekly #londonriots &amp; #londonprotests.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesCranworth @LindaBEdger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As predicted, the media trying to make out that everyone out today are #farright. Also trying to make out they’re all violent thugs, which is false. Media were silent on calling out all the far-left thugs &amp; vandals last wknd &amp; are silent on the lefties stirring trouble today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I noticed you did nothing last week about the violence &amp; vandalism. You didn’t call out the ‘far-left’ protesters that were throwing bottles, flares &amp; bikes at horses and police. Law and Order isn’t about left or right politics, so stop with the divisive language. #londonprotests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Western_Trad To be fair, they weren’t expecting the violence to be so bad last week, so weren’t prepared. They were this week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @kayles_96 Didn’t notice you calling out the ‘left-wing’ thugs last week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@foxy81 @VinnieoDowd @sunny_hundal They are. There’s thugs on all sides I’m afraid to say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Football Lads, Patriots &amp; all the various groups who have gone to London to become #StatueDefenders, make sure you don’t play into the #farright media narrative.

<|startoftext|>@davidgrimeslufc @BorisJohnson Only ones breaking it is @SadiqKhan hiding our history, and the hard left destroying our country with violence and vandalism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SadiqKhan @MetroUK Are you taking the piss? It’s the far left who have hijacked the protests and resorted to violence and vandalism. The silent majority, which you call far-right are people wanting to defend uk historical monuments<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I support @BorisJohnson and I’m proud to be British. I think a lot of people should realise just how good the UK is compared to many other countries. We should stand proud of our history 🇬🇧 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WendyThomason1 @BorisJohnson Agree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You’re against the majority of Brits who agree with @BorisJohnson. Police being attacked, horses having bikes being thrown at them and statues vandalised is, THUGGERY.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It will rise again, if we all stick together and defeat this pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now this news definitely gives me the #FridayFeeling, if nothing else. Democracy must be respected and the @Conservatives &amp; @BorisJohnson are keeping that promise. #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ignorant tweet. The ‘far-right’ as you put it are ordinary British people who are disgusted with the violence, thuggery &amp; vandalism that took place in London &amp; the UK last wknd. They want to defend historic monuments. Disgustingly, Labour support far-left violence. #worldsgonemad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Media stating that anybody who wants to defend Cenotaph &amp; statues like Churchill are ‘far-right’. That will not wash with the majority of the British public. The police should apply the law in full force this weekend or members of the public will be angry. #BritishHistoryMatters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@britainelects @IpsosMORI To be honest, this only looks so dramatic because it’s comparing from 3 months ago when the Tories got a bounce from the pandemic and the fact Labour have changed leaders since, from dangerous Corbyn to just incompetent Starmer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>💙🇬🇧💙🇬🇧💙🇬🇧💙🇬🇧💙🇬🇧💙🇬🇧 To the nasty, thuggish lefties planning on violence, vandalism and destruction on #London streets Saturday, you will not win this. Us proud Britains won’t let you destroy British history. #bbcqt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour are destroying Wales. They have no plans to reopen yet at all, not even for re-opening shops. Labour have always been a disaster in Wales, but they are going the cause economic &amp; financial ruin soon. England are lucky to have @Conservatives &amp; @BorisJohnson in charge #bbcqt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact we have to do this says a lot about the amount of the scum we have in this country. The protests this weekend are likely to be more thuggery and vandalism, dressed up as BLM protests. They are thuggish lefty loons, nothing more than that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MartinDaubney Wouldn’t hold your breath 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@britainelects @Survation One thing to note - These elections aren’t until next year, by then Brexit transitioned period would have ended and Brexit complete. I very much think the Brexit Party voters will move to the Conservatives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@britainelects @Survation The Brexit Party?! Ay? This will just let Labour carry on destroying Wales then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is true in the #UK. All the #snowflakes, lefty loons and those turning to vandalism &amp; violence, dressed up as BLM protesters,you will not win the war you are trying to stoke.

<|startoftext|>Yes @pritipatel. The way Labour tried to dismiss you &amp; say that you didn’t understand racism was disgusting. A sad attempt to play politics with the matter.

<|startoftext|>This is inciting racism. But it’s ok, as it’s directed at a Conservative 🙄 #disgusted<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Shock.  https://t.co/L0aw2LqWKE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Passionately agree with all of the people of Poole here. Statues and monuments are part of our history &amp; culture, which have been part of communities for decades.

<|startoftext|>@JohnathonsTweet @piersmorgan @BorisJohnson They would have said he could have locked down earlier and saved more, or said that more lockdown would have increased job losses. In a lose lose situation. Can’t please anybody really.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kentman43 @Jaswanarth @tnewtondunn @MattHancock All members of SAGE on 13 March unanimously said not to lockdown yet. That was the week before lockdown happened. In hindsight, could be right. However, Boris was following what the experts were telling him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan He’s ‘too expert’ as you put it, said 10 days before the lockdown, in a SAGE meeting, that it wasn’t the right time to lockdown. It was a unanimous decision to not lock down the week before by SAGE experts. So his ‘top expert’ lied on at least one of those occasions...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan You make out this is factual. A former member of SAGE, who had to resign after not adhering to the lockdown, said it. He also agreed on 13 March in a SAGE meeting that it wasn’t the right time to lockdown, which would mean there wasn’t a week delay in lockdown. Clearly lied.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again. Labour are so desperate for power, they will say anything if they think it’ll buy them some votes. Labour &amp; @Keir_Starmer can’t be trusted. #LabourLie #ThursdayFacts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well said. The world has gone nuts. Some people did have links back then, but it was a different time, and many of the same people also did amazing thjngs with their money, like funding Guys Hospital, and leaving huge sums of money to it on his death.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews This is getting ridiculous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trentconsultant @SkyNews You just ignored my tweet. The scientists in SAGE advised on 13 March not to lockdown at that time. There was no her immunity strategy, they followed the scientific and medical experts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IsntTony105 Ferguson was part of SAGE. SAGE advisers *UNANIMOUSLY* agreed on 13 March that the Government should not lockdown at that time (as their own minutes show) so Ministers appear to have followed the scientific and medical advice given to them at the time. #dailybreifing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jaswanarth @tnewtondunn @MattHancock The fact he got testing from almost nothing to the level there is now, which is the largest in Europe, I think @MattHancock has done well. The Government has followed the scientific advice throughout<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Spankymio @NadiaWhittomeMP @pritipatel @FloEshalomi You mean she was sacked because she lied about the care home she was working at, saying it didn’t have enough PPE, when it had 3 months supply. She likes to create division I’ll give her that.  Oh and there were no dodgy deals, but nice try.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Spankymio @NadiaWhittomeMP @pritipatel @FloEshalomi And Nadia was sacked for lying about PPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@denhelder1 @pritipatel Well the video was a personal message about racism that she has had to deal with. On the general point of law and order, there was a lot of action by the police late last night and no doubt a lot going on to bring people to justice now. Fingers crossed they face punishment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well said @pritipatel.   https://t.co/VtGeoEZlIM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGov Yet Labour do not support it...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGov This is political lines now. When it first happened, politicos was out asside. It’s now very political again, and people will generally follow that political sway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>55 deaths shows that whilst still too high, it has really fallen quite low now. Great positivity we can take from this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Priti Patel echoes what Boris has said. “These demonstrations have been subverted by thuggery. Justice will follow." Vandals responsible for the desecration of Churchill's statue were "repulsive criminals who I want to see brought to justice immediately". Thank you both.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ACLUMN Barbaric<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very pleased that both @BorisJohnson and @pritipatel have called out the barbaric thuggery we have seen on our streets the last few days. They have signalled that justice will be served and those responsible held to account. Wonderful news. #ukprotests #mondaythoughts 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely love listening to @Iromg on the radio (and twitter!). He speaks for the majority of us in calling out so much stuff on a daily basis. A proper voice of sanity and reason! Keep it up 👍🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NadiaWhittomeMP Labour condone the violence and criminal activity folks. Exactly why Labour should never be let near power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jay_Beecher I think their now cracking it. Massive police presence at 2am and a kettling job being done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Strongarms12 @MrMasonMills Good. They deserve it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrMasonMills Surely not at this time?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shock.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🇬🇧 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧 British and Proud. I stand for democracy and I stand against people vandalising our historic statues and turning violent on our streets. #ukprotests  🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iromg @talkRADIO Thanks @Iromg. We need somebody speaking up for what the majority of Britain are thinking. These protests are turning into an excuse for so many people to go out vandalise, whilst turning violent. It’s a disgrace and needs to be called out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If they don’t like the British flag, then know where the border is to leave. This country doesn’t need scum like this. #londonprotests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BritannicMight I agree, but difficult to police.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think I was just sick in my mouth 🤢 These lefty loons are not just violent, vandals, but also completely crazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Violence and vandalism does undermine a protests of solidarity yes. Do get with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lock them up and throw away the key.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawkinsReturns I hope he’s bloody arrested and punished<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chakrabortty Nobody at these protests believes lives matter, otherwise they wouldn’t be putting thousands at risk by spreading a deadly virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get tough on them @pritipatel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They have been awful. Cressida Dick and the Labour London mayor @SadiqKhan have been useless. What’s the point of them?! Bring the army in @BorisJohnson. They’re all committing illegal offences by being in large groups spreading disease, let alone the violence and vandalism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a disgrace. Vandalising the Winston Churchill statue, pulling down others, is quite frankly, disgusting. All weekend we’ve seen violence &amp; vandalism, as well as the invisible deadly virus being spread by huge crowds of nasty, viscous scummy lefties. #LawAndOrder #UkRiots<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely disgraceful behaviour. All I see is a bunch of thugs &amp; scum, trying to pretend that they are there for #BlackLivesMatterUK. Surely though, the police shouldn’t be running from them. Don’t lose control of our streets @metpoliceuk. P.S. Where’s Labour Mayor? #LawAndOrder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Im very disappointed with how shit the @metpoliceuk have been. Are they seriously getting paid to just walk around doing jack? I know they came under a lot of disgusting violence yesterday, but they can’t just throw in the towel for fear of the same. #londonprotests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_BrexitTory 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson Can you do something about all the scum on the streets protesting please, it’s unacceptable. They are vandalising things, turning violent and are spreading an invisible deadly virus. They can’t be allowed to run riot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More needs to be done, far too much scum on the streets. They are turning violent &amp; vandalising buildings &amp; statues like Winston Churchill. Time to stop pandering to them. It’s not racist to be tough on Law &amp; Order. Come on @pritipatel @BorisJohnson. #londonprotest #ukprotests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Laurena26947994 Exactly. Though I would add that even the peaceful ones are illegal &amp; quite frankly will be spreading an invisible deadly virus. There has to be other ways to express yourself. Going to mass gatherings that spread disease &amp; death is not acceptable, nor is turning them violent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hear! Hear! Winston Churchill will always be one of the most important PMs we’ve ever had.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattHancock Get them off the streets then!! They’re criminals who are cause destruction and vandalising everything in sight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyTNewton No excuse for people to be violent and vandalise things. They’re nothing but criminals. I didn’t support that kind of movement at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the fuck are the police doing?! This has given too far. It’s unacceptable to be vandalising Churchill or anything, let alone being violent too. All this in the middle of a pandemic where mass gatherings are illegal, which will cause lives to be lost. I’m absolutely livid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What support I had left for the #BlackLivesMatter movement is gone. Every protest has turned to violence, vandalism and destruction. It’s simply not acceptable. I feel that most of them protesting don’t give a frig about #GeorgeFloyd, but simply want to riot. #ukprotests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryLineker He didn’t put ANY lives at risk, nor did he break social distancing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bit odd considering @lisanandy spent most of last year in silence on Labours racism and anti-semitism. She then tried to get Corbyn elected as PM, knowing full well he had ignored all of the racism running deep within the party. But rich of Lisa Nandy here. #Marr #SundayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPJHodges @ladyhaja Half hearted apology.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As if he has. He’s silent on everything, hoping to just pick up points by the media bashing of the Government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryLineker @RogerWestwood I’ve always said that mass gatherings if social distancing isn’t possible isn’t right, whether it be protest or beach. If you can’t socially distance, you should leave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hardly largely peaceful. It was largely unlawful, as mass gatherings with no social distancing is banned. We had thousands breaking the law &amp; hundreds vandalising property &amp; becoming extremely violent, whilst trying to hurt horses. Media: silent. #ukprotests #marr #sundayvibes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brazil removes death data amid rising death toll. This will mean that Brazil will never now give a true total death figure, which was about to ‘officially’ go above UK. Like so many other countries, true death figures are not being released.   https://t.co/uR9tLdEmKX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on @BorisJohnson, it’s over to you. Call it out. #londonprotest &amp; #ukprotests are unlawful &amp; against the rules on mass gatherings. They allow the spread of an invisible killer virus, whilst allowing vandalism &amp; streets to turn violent. @SadiqKhan &amp; Cress Dick not capable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kadiridapo @fant1345 @jessphillips Well then they can’t open.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kadiridapo @fant1345 @jessphillips I haven’t seen a workplace with thousands and thousands gathered together like sardines. Also, work places have to be covid secure and abide by social distancing rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>⛔️ I think @BorisJohnson &amp; @pritipatel need to take a tougher stance on the #ukprotests. They are not acceptable at all. LAW &amp; ORDER.  1️⃣People are willingly spreading an invisible killer virus, in mass crowds. 2️⃣Hurting horses 🐴  3️⃣Vandalising &amp; getting violent.  #londonprotest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nichola20950519 @MrHarryCole Nothing to do with objects, bikes and flares being thrown then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon You stand with people spreading an invisible deadly virus, who are breaking the law by not socially distancing. Wow. Great mayor you are. #londonprotests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonnaWisdom10 Agree completely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fant1345 @jessphillips I did yes. I also called out people not socially distancing on beaches. If you can’t socially distance, you should leave in my eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mikie_Design Well, in my eyes anybody at a protest that is not socially distancing is attempting to murder people. They are willingly spreading an invisible, deadly virus. That’s is disgusting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fant1345 @jessphillips The only people now killing people, are the people not social distancing, like we saw today all across the UK at the protests. These people are spreading the virus and will cause lives to be lost  https://t.co/ZQTU0swAGZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan It’s against the law and will cause deaths. If you can’t socially distance, you should leave. The end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peston Well, for one, telling  people to socially distance, not that they are at these violent protests.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mikie_Design Whether it was an ambulance or now, that behaviour isn’t acceptable. Neither are the violent protests and riots in London<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone at a protest is a criminal. It’s against the law to be in large gatherings because it spreads a deadly virus to others.That’s before the violence and vandalism by some scum. Violence against horses &amp; police, or vandalising a war memorial isn’t acceptable. #londonprotest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If black lives are more at risk during this pandemic, how is going out in large gatherings going to help? It means the virus spreads amongst the most at risk. Absolutely ridiculous, and that’s before you even look at the violence &amp; vandalism. #londonprotest #BlackLivesMatterUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Too late. Two major protest days and they turned it violent on both occasions, whilst also vandalising buildings. Appalling behaviour at the #BlackLivesMatterUK protest. An excuse to protest. That’s before you look at the fact nobody is socially distancing. Lives will be lost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BritannicMight Agree. Completely disgusting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews @SkyNewsBreak @skymarkwhite Disgusted at the behaviour. No social distancing during it it and lots of violence, vandalism and objects being chucked. This isn’t a show of solidarity any more, it’s an excuse to turn thuggish and riot. Appalling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BritannicMight Horses and riot gear out now, but it should have been out earlier. It’s not acceptable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surprise surprise, the protests in London for #BlackLivesMattters has turned violent. Disgusting behaviour and all this in the middle of a pandemic. What does violence in the UK do to help the cause? Fuck all. It also risks lives as it spread a deadly virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindaNi121202 Exactly, so this puts them at risk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The irony ay....🙄 #lockdownlessons<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@No1Aunty @pritipatel @metpoliceuk You carry on pushing your desire for the law to be broken and for more people to catch the virus in mass gatherings, and deaths to go up, and ill do my thing. Have a nice day 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@No1Aunty @pritipatel @metpoliceuk I dont agree with putting throudands of lives at risk by mass gatherings that risk spreading the infection. Shows I care, unlike you. If you agree with mass gatherings that risks thousands of lives during a pandemic, that will cost lives, you are happy for black lives to be lost<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darvidhat @DPJHodges @AManWithAClue He risked no lives and was within guidelines for leaving his London house. Attending mass gatherings like today risks lives and you know it.  https://t.co/kDmmlwEEIc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrjamesob Cummings in a car, never breaking social distancing and risking no lives, is of course,  the same as mass gatherings like today with no social distancing and thousands of lives put at risk....  https://t.co/yFvESAD8Vp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrjamesob Cummings never risked any lives, he never broke social distancing. These people are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darvidhat @DPJHodges @AManWithAClue Cummings didn’t break social distancing, nor did he risk anybody’s life. The people protesting in mass gatherings are risking thousands of lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPJHodges 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@No1Aunty @pritipatel @metpoliceuk I agree in principle of the protests, and am against what happened in USA, obviously. But the whole things about BLM is that lives matter. Thousands in mass gatherings will kill lots of people, esp BAME, who are greatly at risk. It’s both unlawful and irresponsible to attend them  https://t.co/OqiiRCOStD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@No1Aunty @pritipatel @metpoliceuk I’m a racist? Wow, you’ve just plucked that out of the air. You really are the lowest of the low. I’ve done nothing of the sort to be called that. I don’t agree with mass protests because they’re huge gatherings that can kill, but I don’t agree with packed beaches either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@No1Aunty @pritipatel @metpoliceuk I answered all of yours actually.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@No1Aunty @pritipatel @metpoliceuk And I don’t agree with that either. There was a jump in cases in Southend. So clearly it’s an issue. What’s your point? You never answer my question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@No1Aunty @pritipatel @metpoliceuk Well he washed his hands before and after. What do you think of the thousands of people today gathering in mass groups, with no social distancing? Massive risk of spread wouldn’t you think?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPJHodges @ComfortableBlue Not very comparable are they though. Cummings risked nobody by socially distancing, these thousands protesting in many many cities, risk everyone attending, and their friends a family back home. Mass gatherings are unlawful and send the message that no lives matter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Basically, the message they are sending is that no lives matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@No1Aunty @pritipatel @metpoliceuk You mean that trip that was fully socially distanced, where he came into contact with nobody? Oh yes, very risky 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very positive news that both the death rate and infections are going down. Not likely to last much longer though, with all the mass gatherings at the #BlackLivesMattters protests. They will very much spread the pandemic and kill far more people. All I see is selfish people 👇🏼  https://t.co/hJTkyZTFA4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So sod the risk to people’s lives then it seems. What is the point of pushing the line that #BlackLivesMatter, if the very thing you’re doing is very much putting those lives at risk. We are in the middle of a pandemic that kills people. Mass gatherings are risky and unlawful.  https://t.co/uAzVa0EXSr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The irony of the people protesting at the #BlackLivesMattters protest in the UK, does the very opposite to the purpose of it. It will end up killing so many people &amp; one of the most at risk, are the BAME community. Mass gatherings like this are a massive risk to life &amp; unlawful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the R rate goes up, if infections go up, if deaths go up, it won’t be the Governments fault, it will be each &amp; every one of the people attending mass protests for #BlackLivesMatter around the country (who aren’t abiding by social distancing).  @BorisJohnson will be blamed tho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If somebody from the Government did this, @piersmorgan would be having a go at them day in, day out on @GMB &amp; his social media. The rules clearly state you can meet up with 5 others (no more than 6) using social distancing. Rule broken. One rule for Piers (&amp; son) another for us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @paddypower @mcginleygolf @petercrouch @HKane @flintoff11 @TommyFleetwood1 @BeefGolf @thomasbjorngolf @CarlyBooth92 So you’ve broken the rules. One rule for celebs, another rule for us. The rules state you can’t meet with more than 5 others. Max 6 people, all socially distanced.  You have a go at others, but break them yourself, as well as your son breaking social distancing to attend protests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cathynewman @Channel4News You don’t report facts, so I wouldn’t class you as news worthy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarlMunt @MattHancock @NHSBT There’s no lying. The UK has one of the most accurate and quickest reporting on deaths. The likes of Italy are 2 months behind, which is why international comparisons are flawed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It may be raining, but meeting indoors with people not in your household is unlawful, and risks lives. Also, going out to join mass gatherings massively risks lives. Social distancing isn’t possible when joining thousands at protests for #BlackLivesMatter. Don’t do it.  https://t.co/av6rWBPYXp<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ady44490135 @SkyNewsBreak I don’t see anybody crying. However, a deal would be mutually beneficial to both the UK and EU. EU is too arrogant to see that currently<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ady44490135 @SkyNewsBreak People assumed the EU would be reasonable. They arnt. No deal it is if it continues<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@silas_trace @SkyNewsBreak So we are treated the worst. The EU will lose more as we’ll strike better deals with other countries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobDavePerry I think you’ll find that’s the EU. They won’t even give us what they gave the likes of Canada<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@silas_trace @SkyNewsBreak They won’t even give us what they gave the likes of Canada. You can’t expect the UK to agree to basically following EU rules, when we have left the EU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNewsBreak Well, that’s no surprise when you are trying to lock the UK into EU regulations and laws. The UK won’t stand for it and are staying firm, hence the deadlock once again. The European Union have shown once again, what a morally corrupt organisation they are. #Brexit #NoExtension 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, that’s no surprise when you are trying to lock the UK into EU regulations and laws. The UK won’t stand for it and are staying firm, hence the deadlock once again.

<|startoftext|>Not that you’d have known about it if you only watch the mainstream news like @BBCNews. Showing great leadership @BorisJohnson and I’m sure that a vaccine will come faster than we think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FloraWindebank @bbcquestiontime What’s happening on Hong Kong is ever changing, hence we could do something to help if needed. In the USA, the consequences of what happened are already unfolding with the people being charged etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorofLondon The more people die? Government advice is to socially distance at all times. Yet we see so many BAME people protesting on the streets in mass gatherings, exactly against advice. If they follow Gov advice, more people will not die.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Considering mass gatherings are banned due to #COVID19 &amp; the fact nobody seems to socially distance at them (as we saw in London), its ridiculous. Normally I’d fully support the right to protest peacefully, but currently, this right is superseded by the right to life. #bbcqt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dominic Cummings didn’t even break social distancing, yet it got wall to wall coverage for a week and @BarryGardiner got zero coverage. The media are corrupt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Considering mass gatherings are banned due to #COVID19 &amp; the fact nobody seems to socially distance at them (as we saw in London), is this right @SWPCardiff?

<|startoftext|>A shame that other police forces aren’t doing the same. Mass protests with no social distancing (as we saw in London) isn’t acceptable. It’s basically killing people. Murder. I don’t support that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbcquestiontime What the fuck is the UK Government meant to do about something that has already happened in another country? Ridiculous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyhewertson Yes, and so will Boris.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thing is, to some it isn’t about equality, some think #BlackLivesMatter more. More white people are shot by police in USA, but we don’t have the same reaction. What happened in USA was tragic &amp; racism is awful, but dare I say it - there are a lot of racists that are black as well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s ridiculous. The news isn’t reporting the...erm...news. They also didn’t fully report on the violence, thuggery and vandalism in London yesterday. They didn’t report on Labour MP @BarryGardiner breaking social distancing, BUT they spoke about Cummings for a week solid 🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MimiJ9 No point when the message was stay at home you absolute tool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NaughtyNooNoo89 @DoPradista @SkyNewsBreak And? You are allowed to go to work while being 2m apart. The meeting took place on Tuesday, the day before he got ill and started self isolating. I don’t see what point you’re trying to make. Many people are going to work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NaughtyNooNoo89 @DoPradista @SkyNewsBreak It’s 15 min or more within 2m. It’s quite clear on track and trace guildlenes. Maybe an eye test needed for you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarryGardiner You can join, but must social distance. You didn’t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonlfc12 @samgray_28 @SkyNewsBreak Cummings self isolated, as you know. Typical labour lefty response<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shelts1969 @jonlfc12 @samgray_28 @SkyNewsBreak Exactly. I’ve had illnesses just come on, they have to start at some point. The problem is, so many Labour lefties don’t like facts, they don’t like common sense, they just want to use anything they can to attack Government. Kinda pathetic really.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samgray_28 @jonlfc12 @SkyNewsBreak Why the fuck wouldn’t he if he’s ill 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samgray_28 @jonlfc12 @SkyNewsBreak In the commons yes, not in the meeting. He left the commons after that speech to self isolate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xorhiannonxox @SkyNewsBreak I agree he did look ill, however, that was after his meeting with Boris.  I’ve had a meeting before in the morning and been fine, and then felt unwell an hour later. Symptoms have to come on at a certain point, and these were AFTER the meetings. If not, nobody would have met.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonlfc12 @samgray_28 @SkyNewsBreak That’s how things start yes. There has to be a point where you suddenly get symptoms of any illness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xorhiannonxox @stamford_dan @SkyNewsBreak That was after his meeting with Boris. He had no symptoms before that speech he made on the commons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xorhiannonxox @stamford_dan @SkyNewsBreak He wasn’t self isolating until AFTER the meeting. He also didn’t get symptoms until AFTER the meeting. So you’re wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xorhiannonxox @SkyNewsBreak At the time of the meeting, nobody was self isolating and nobody had symptoms. People should get their facts together before posting silly comments<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samgray_28 @jonlfc12 @SkyNewsBreak Which he wasn’t doing at the time. Symptoms came on AFTER the meeting. If have thought that was self explanatory<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealElwynD @britainelects @YouGov Far better? A worse infection/death rate than England. Hardly any testing and no proper track and trace. No, they are not doing better. People just don’t realise that facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@britainelects @YouGov Yet weirdly, the death rates are far higher in Wales than England and health is devolved to Labour in Wales. It shows that people aren’t understanding what is really going on in Wales, and are following the national media<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@woodburygooner @jonlfc12 @SkyNewsBreak He wasn’t self isolating at that point though was he<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alfiewm_ @timmyvoe @ElectionMapsUK @YouGov Except wales has the worst infection rates in the UK. So people are mistaken in thinking Labour are doing a good job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoPradista @SkyNewsBreak No actually. You are allowed to go to work in the same building as others, as long as you socially distance. If somebody has symptoms or is confirmed with it, anybody who has been WITHIN 2m has to self isolate. They were abiding by social distancing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonlfc12 @SkyNewsBreak For having a socially distanced meeting? Ay? Their working, and working with social distancing. What is a shambles about that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xorhiannonxox @SkyNewsBreak How is it one rule for them, one rule for others? Don’t get your point. You only self isolate if you have come into contact with somebody who has symptoms IF you have been within 2m of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missmallz @Manclad12062388 @Gregophile447 A protester was clearly breaching the line and squaring up to police and was this pushed back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Michael_Heaver I hope these are all arrested. Absolutely disgusting behaviour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ellye01 @ThomasDoherty9 @hyuckjaems The police officer was pushing him back as he had cleared breached the barrier and was getting too close to Downing Street.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarryGardiner That makes no difference. You could have got it the next day. Also, you could catch it off somebody if you don’t have it &amp; are not socially distancing. Breaking clear rules on social distancing is not acceptable and as an MP you should be setting an example. You broke the rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrHarryCole Track and trace is only for people that have been within 2m of the person that tested positive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickeardleybbc Social distancing means that he shouldn’t have come into close proximity to anybody at Westminster. Next.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@3_katemckay Don’t make it about skin colour. It’s about violence. It’s not acceptable whatever colour skin you have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamuelJJack And taxpayers have to pay for this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pritipatel @metpoliceuk It’s clear that barely any of the protests are abiding by social distancing. Even Labour MPs aren’t abiding by them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gregophile447 Here we go, blame the police. The police did not attack first at all. This is not America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One rule for Labour, one rule for us.   Barry Gardiner needs to be called out for his behaviour. Clearly breaking social distancing isn’t acceptable, especially as an MP, who should be setting an example.   @Keir_Starmer any comment?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting violent towards UK police, because of something that happened in the USA is disgusting and a massive shame. Turning solidarity into a riot of violence and abuse is so wrong. Appalled by this behaviour. #BlackLivesMatterUK #WhiteLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All up for showing support for #GeorgeFloyd, who died in the USA .However, you don’t show support by getting violent towards UK police &amp; not abiding by social distancing. Absolutely disgusted by this behaviour #BlackLivesMattterUK #DailyBriefinguk  https://t.co/WftAtFuSay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MahyarTousi Unacceptable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A Labour MP admitting to breaking social distancing rules. What a bad example that demonstrates. What will be done then @Keir_Starmer? An MP should abide by social distancing. No media reports @BBCNews? Protest yes, but peacefully AND with social distancing. #BlackLivesMatterUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wtf have the police done wrong in the UK?! This is not acceptable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The media trying desperately to get the scientists to contradict the Government, unsuccessfully. They also don’t understand the basics &amp; the scientists have to keep repeating themselves. Aren’t the media meant to help inform, rather than cause confusion?! 🙄#DailyUpdate #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If this is accurate, people should be ashamed. This behaviour will kill thousands through a second peak of the virus. How can people possibly think all these protests, whilst not socially distancing is helpful 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course #BlackLivesMattter, and what happened in USA was disgusting and should never have happened. However, I don’t agree with this 👇🏼 Personally, I believe we are all equal &amp; so don’t think anybody should be getting on their knee to others or on their doorstop in this way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JakeGGodfrey Labour talk a load of nonsense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidLammy Lies. You can’t compare to countries that are 2 months behind in releasing their true death figures. You’re comparing up to date figures with lots of not up to date figures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boris rang him after his letter. Labour playing silly political games and it doesn’t come across well. Boris very energetic in his performance and saying exactly how it is. #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@George_Osborne @EveningStandard  https://t.co/YIuZFxs42N<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PreetRang I don’t think I agree with this....arnt we all equal? If so, nobody should be kneeling in front of anybody.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahwollaston Do sod off. Their social distancing, as are most of us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. Huge support from Government. This is on top of the bounce back loans and the fact the Government are paying 80% of worker wages. A great effort by Government to support this country through a difficult time. #wednesdaymorning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s clear to see, the BBC and the general media have an agenda to extend the #Brexit transition this year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are the SNP turning up in shorts at Westminster?  🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robertlargan Labour for you. Utterly useless and always say what they think people want to hear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamCoatesSky There are several ticks UP, and they tick back down. Don’t start scaremongering.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Until each country has released accurate and up to date figures, it’s never going to be an accurate picture and countries that tease their death figures fastest will come our worst.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahaha! But then some wouldn’t be able to try and score some political points then...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well said 👇🏼 Great to have you as an MP @JamieWallisMP. It’s clear the public wanted to leave the EU and there should be no extension to the transition period, which would result in the UK paying billions more to the European Union. 🇬🇧 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@campbellclaret @BorisJohnson It’s only bloody Tuesday morning. Grow the fuck up mate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great to have the @Conservatives Government finally starting to ease restrictions. Kids so happy to be back at school, workers happy to open their stalls, and many shoppers thrilled to be out shopping again. The economy is vital for people to live a happy life. #KeepYourDistance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>England lockdown eases: First meeting for grandparents and new grandchild. So nice to see this and definitely a good move by Boris to allow people to now see family and friends. If we all stick to the 2m rule, this can work. #unlock   https://t.co/7PXiUfZ9Gm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lord_Sugar @GMB @susannareid100 I think she’s pathetically just an ornament these days, bobbing along to @piersmorgan in every way. It’s clear that holding the Government to account does not mean clinging to every negative and blowing it out of proportion and nothing positive mentioned. @GMB should inform.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPJHodges June<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGov I’d say this is very much how the media have spun it. Eg - testing has been ramped up from a zero starting base to more than any country in Europe &amp; 8m workers are being paid by the Government, more than any other country. Businesses being saved by tax relief, grants, loans etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@susannareid100 @GMB Think I’m washing my hair<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@britainelects @YouGov  https://t.co/TYSjUQnSGF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anna03573669 @kevinhollinrake Except he never broke social distancing and thus put NOBODY at risk. They are. Facts matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB @piersmorgan @susannareid100 Back so soon? 😞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great news and exactly what is needed right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ayeshahazarika She’s still an MP. Why? She clearly broke the rules. Some people are not MPs and did things for a vulnerable child. Notice the difference?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdwardJDavey @BorisJohnson The difference is they were all breaking the rules for leisure, not something that was critical. Cummings travelled for his vulnerable child while him and his wife were getting ill. Completely different. You surely can’t be that stupid 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_sjsx @itvnews You can do it with social distancing, you don’t have to be reckless when making a stand. You don’t expect me to understand? Wow, completely below the belt. I’ll end the conversation there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrGABaines Starmer says what he think people need to hear, bit like Corbyn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_sjsx @itvnews Their intentions may be good but the actions of crowds with no social distancing can cause more spread of a deadly virus. This will lead to more deaths, which is not a good thing. If people die from this, it helps how?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Governments fault no doubt, ay @piersmorgan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnityNewsNet My thoughts are by doing this (no social distancing) they will not only cause more deaths from Corona, but specifically back deaths, which they claim to want to protect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itvnews This angers me as mass crowds will cause more coronavirus infections and more deaths. Ironic twist is they say they want to protect lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And in the process, don’t stick to social distancing and thus will potentially cause an increase in infection and deaths. All lives matter. Wtf is wrong with these people 🙄 #riots2020 #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PippaCrerar But yet, you made up the second trip to Durham. How could you have a witness for something that didn’t happen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@metecoban92 @JamesEnders @Keir_Starmer @OpiniumResearch It’s not significant at all. Easy to criticise somebody leading a country through a global health crisis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who’s had a BBQ today then? ☀️ 🍔 🍗 🍹 🍺  Absolutely loving this weather! #SaturdayVibes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ItCorbyn @andywigmore @campbellclaret @BBCNews @BorisJohnson He did not say fluffed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NinaParker Did the opposite instead, thanks for the reminder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pinkandtweed So 180,000 out of 60million plus. Around 276 people from each constituency, and likely the majority to be from Labour activists. Move on, far bigger things in people’s lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BethRigby You will always get differing opinions in a large committee, group or meeting. If everyone had exactly the same thought, there would be no point. Ridiculous tweet and comment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rob1878_ @britainelects @spreadsheetben Tests per day, which includes people tested and tests sent out (which are done within 24hrs)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rob1878_ @britainelects @spreadsheetben I don’t know the exact numbers, but a lot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@britainelects @spreadsheetben We have to remember that the UK is testing more than any other country in Europe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jay_Beecher Of all the days, today is the positive positive 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthea_bailey Well said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RockboltG @BBCNewsnight @maitlis Damage is already done...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheStephenRalph You’d love that with the deadline extension coming up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @LBCNews Considering half his party are breaking the guidelines, I hardly think he’s acting as he preaches.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCHelena So, exactly what Boris has been saying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbclaurak I think you’ll find it’s gone down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hearmenow86 @BorisJohnson Keep dreaming. No, it’s not actually...but don’t let facts get in the way of your twisted agenda 🙄 Do try and keep up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hearmenow86 @BorisJohnson Big deal, a typo. If that is all you have, then no wonder you support labour and all the scum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hearmenow86 @BorisJohnson You’re love for all the Labour lefties makes me wana vom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hearmenow86 @BorisJohnson If that’s all you get from a positive tweet clapping everyone, then what does that say about the type of person you are. Haters gunna hate I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hearmenow86 @BorisJohnson I was clapping everyone, so why the obsession with Boris?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hearmenow86 @BorisJohnson Don’t choke, you might need the NHS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BadgerC150CRS @BorisJohnson Last year it was also agreed that NHS workers would get a massive pay increase starting now. So massive progress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BadgerC150CRS @BorisJohnson You means the extra 20 billion or so they agreed last year...🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson I don’t just clap for the NHS, I clap for you Boris - working tirelessly to help this country move forward, your team, everyone isolating around the UK, everyone struggling through these hard times. Everyone in this great country who’s doing their bit, deserves a clap. 👏🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afneil Do we know why Italy are around 2 months behind us in releasing up to date figures? It’s distorting a lot of the comparisons that so much of the media are trying to do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afneil So many countries haven’t updated their figures yet, so @piersmorgan is reporting things he knows isn’t comparable. You can only compare when each country has released full figures that is up to date.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seeyouinpub @Jim57620113 @Conservatives Harries didn’t mention Cummings. She even said she wasn’t going to get involved in a specific case, but repeated her preveious guidance on vulnerable and exceptional cases. You can try and twist facts, but you’re making it all up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seeyouinpub @Jim57620113 @Conservatives Freedoms? Boris tried to protect them from answering political questions on a row. He eventually said for them to answer. They said they agreed that they didn’t want to answer a political question, and even stronger. Therefore, they wouldn’t have answered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seeyouinpub @Jim57620113 @Conservatives They didn’t verify. They said that they didn’t want to answer and thus get involved in politics, so agreed with the PM. Actually said their desire to answer a political question was even stronger than the PMs view on them getting involved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seeyouinpub @Conservatives Gagged? Did you not watch it? They spoke and they said they didn’t want to get involved in politics. Don’t tell half a story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbcnickrobinson But worrying that @bbcnickrobinson is zoning out after just 1 question. It was clear from the answer the CMO &amp; CSO gave is that that they don’t want to get involved in politics. But tweet more inaccurate stuff, getting used to the media bull now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbcnickrobinson They said in the press conference they didn’t want to get involved. Were you not watching?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think @SamCoatesSky got slapped down completely by the Chief medical and chief scientific officer then. Boris was trying to protect them from gutter journalists and their questioning. From their answer, you could see they did not want to be dragged into politics. Give it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbclaurak They wouldn’t have answered anyway, as they said 2 questions later.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @metpoliceuk Do remember, his wife didn’t have a cough or high fever. She was ill, but not with those symptoms. So not he did not. This isn’t journalism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbclaurak So basically, there is no confirmation Dom did anything wrong. A no he didn’t going to Durham, and a “might” on Barnard castle. Case closed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RockboltG Hence why she doesn’t have many retweets 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🚨 Durham Police statement regarding Dominic Cummings:  On going from London to Durham - he did “Not” breach lockdown rules.   On going to Barnard Castle - he “Might” have made a minor breach.   ❌ The Media: Dominic Cummings “DID” breach lockdown rules. 🙈🙄 #mediawitchunt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I “might” have missed a critical work meeting today, but I “might” not have missed a critical work meeting today. Therefore, I don’t think you can tell me that I DID miss a meeting.  Facts matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @Telegraph Where in the police statement does it say he ‘did’. I see ‘might’. It also states he didn’t breach going to Durham. Again, inaccurate reporting by journalists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davemacladd Where is the word ‘did’, I see ‘might’.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NHSMillion Nowhere in the statement did it say he DID breach. You’re a liar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kevin_Maguire @SuellaBraverman Again, you’re lying. They said no breach going to Durham and he MIGHT have breached going to Barnard Castle, which is the same as might not have breached. So at the point does it say he did breach.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnJCrace They said might. Which is the same as might not have. Also, no further action. Case closed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PippaCrerar It’s seems @PippaCrerar is a compulsive liar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PippaCrerar It says *might* not *did* about going to Barnard Castle and that going to Durham wasn’t a breach. Again, you are lying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gorgeous_manon @philgentco No<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suzanne_moore Thanks. I’ll do just that. I think it’s awful she has been replaced tonight, it should be for the rest of her career. A BBC journalist should be impartial, she failed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmasonnews @maitlis 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kevin_Maguire He doesn’t need to be taken seriously by anyone other than Boris and No10. He’s an advisor &amp; strategist, and a bloody good one. Nice try.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrHarryCole She can pipe down with the antics she played last year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Ne never broke social distancing and the 2m rule. He also self isolated for 2 weeks. If they’re breaking social distancing, they should be fined. People using Cummings as an excuse, whilst not knowing the actual facts around it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tinkernurse Erm, no. They’ve come through the worst of the storm. You don’t leave now. Certainly not when the remain vultures are circling for a brexit extension<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@talkRADIO Shocking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbclaurak Do bore off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But the media don’t like to focus on any positives and how well this Government and nation is doing to save lives. The Government works tirelessly every day to protect people, whether it be with testing, paying their wages, or providing grants.  #selectcommittee #LiaisonCommittee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickeardleybbc Boris would be right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But that doesn’t suit the media agenda does it....especially with the Brexit transition extension deadline  coming up...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🍔 🍟 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan This is the peak day of the week (normally a Tuesday on non bank holiday weeks). I have no doubt that if the numbers tumble by half tomorrow, you won’t be given the same stats of a 55% decrease.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan 209 on the trend is very low as it includes yesterday and the bank holiday lag. It will likely halve tomorrow. How do you call yourself an actual journalist, you’d don’t appear to understand the basics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sarahkoleary1 @BorisJohnson Every case is different and there will be times when a situation made it impossible for somebody, whether it be a vulnerable child, somebody have a heart attack etc. It’s not quite black and white in all situation.s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steviep78516675 @BorisJohnson We all have to exercise mate, especially have a bout of massive illness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson Thanks for all the work you are doing, you and your team are working tirelessly and I’m sure that many other will agree and want to thank you too, especially with a hostile media that make things so hard to communicate to the public.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 @maitlis Has anybody complained to @Ofcom about this, and a lot of other things over the last several days/weeks?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nailed it 👇🏼This whole row is very political and has become a #mediawitchhunt for reasons that go beyond him driving to Durham. It’s very much to do with the people who have never liked him and how he effectively got Brexit through and the Tories a majority. #wednesdaythoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You are that sort of party though aren’t you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allisonpearson I’d rather keep 2m and have the pubs open sooner than don’t do 2m now, and pubs take longer to open<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SholaMos1 Erm....he wasn’t even there. He was hundreds of miles away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSterling27 He wasn’t at his house. It wasn’t his party. Hey your facts right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jo_beckett The damage is done. A lot of research has been done that proves most people zone in &amp; out of politics and mostly see headlines. 4 days of solid coverage of often inaccurate claims has cut through but damage done. Better to ride it out now &amp; start to recover the lost ground later<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarronNaledi Caught doing what exactly? Going to isolate in a house closer to family, so that his child had somebody to look after him if himself and his wife became to ill to do so themselves. As per the guidelines, that’s allowed. You’re an idiot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t let the media win. They reported many lies &amp; inaccuracies about #DomCummings to confuse the public and whip up a storm. That’s not journalism, it’s harassment, deceit and it’s disgusting. #mediascum #Newsnight #icantbreathe #BreakTheSilence #tuesdayvibes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnIdiotKing @SamCoatesSky 😂😂😂🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well said, Roger. This is exactly the point I have made several times. If he did resign, it would open up a can of worms and give the green light for the media to behave like this whenever they dislike somebody or something within Government. The media are a disgrace. #Covid_19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@disappoptimism @SamCoatesSky The fact is, you don’t seem to grasp facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamCoatesSky Some people have been misled by inaccurate reports from the media. I’ve had some friends tell me things they’ve heard, like the second trip etc (which is false), which is why they thought he should resign. When will the media apologise for misleading the public? @PippaCrerar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andyc32 @defyingtheleft Sacked for what? Fuck all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattHancock A personal thanks from em for all you’re doing as well, you don’t get enough praise for how tirelessly you work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jessphillips Stop talking about it, being the easiest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A prick 👇🏼 Glad we left the European Union! 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peston @MattHancock Bore off Peston<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevinburt28 @olivera_h @SamCoatesSky Bless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s Labour, it’s what they do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveJNicholls @EmmaDolphin7 @SamCoatesSky Well we’ve left, which is what I was referring too. Obvs we still have other aspects such as the trade deal. But as I said the actual exit has happened. Nice try. Bless that you’re not that clever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love how quickly @MattHancock moved on from @Peston’s pathetic question. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@disappoptimism @SamCoatesSky You have your opinion, I have mine. No point talking any more as facts don’t matter to you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@disappoptimism @SamCoatesSky So if somebody was having a heart attack, they should stay at home? No, because there are certain situations where you don’t. That includes safeguarding children, as was the case here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DitoFrancis @LindaWa17073882 @SamCoatesSky Never said you did<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmmaDolphin7 @SamCoatesSky The scalp of one of the key people that got Brexit done and the Tories a majority. A lot of the people scremain about Dom hater him before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindaWa17073882 @DitoFrancis @SamCoatesSky Rightly asking questions? They keep making inaccurate reports, whilst also breaking social distancing. You haven’t supported Boris for quite some time if you have spent the last month retweeting Piers Morgan and his vile torrid of bile<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@disappoptimism @SamCoatesSky Decisive change? The latest voting intention that came out today and was taken over the weekend puts the Tories in 46%, 13 ahead of Labour.  He’s an advisor and a bloody good one at that. He certainly shouldn’t be going anywhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@d_m_simmons Respectively massively disagree. I’d rather have this temporary damage from the media onslaught and pull things back, than lasting damage of being seen to let the media dictate who advises Government and also the weaker government we would have without key personnel, such as Dom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamCoatesSky If anybody resigns, it allows the remain media elite and opposition to win. That should never be allowed to happen. It would also say that harassment, bully and intimidation works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jessphillips He’s the PMs advisor. I wouldn’t expect him to be talking and meeting all Tory MPs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To those slagging off @BorisJohnson - just remember that it was this Tory Government that decided to pay the wages of around 7million people so they didn’t lose their job. They are handing out loans &amp; grants to businesses to help them survive - more than other country. #COVID__19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarkOptimism @theousherwood Do you know what conversed means?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamboultonSKY It’s not acceptable for the media to go to his house like a pack of wolves baying for blood, nor is it to go to his elderly parents to harass them. Any media that behaves in a way to bully and harass somebody, or to even encourage the public to do so (as it has done) is scum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KittyKatPK @Rylan Well it’s certainly not about the facts. Either way, the Government needs to concentrate on the crisis and economy atm. This media fascination and witch hunt for 3 days is pointless and a distraction<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Politics really can consume you. Must zone out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KittyKatPK @Rylan If it had been Starmer who had done the same, or perhaps Sturgeon, I doubt you’d be saying the same things. But hey ho, tribal politics comes into it sometimes and common sense disappears<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KittyKatPK @Rylan He was given the all clear to go back to work, including from medical people. His wife however was still worried and wanted to just make sure he was ok driving, hence the shorter drive locally. You’ve already decided he’s guilty, and no doubt your politics have decided that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahSchijen Not with the current state of them. Certainly not @DailyMirror @DailyMailUK or @guardian<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KittyKatPK @Rylan A vulnerable person can be any child who is dependant, as the medial officers have pointed out. If two parents feel they are about to become seriously ill, as was the case, it is perfectly reasonable to seek out family just encase. Hence the travel to be nearer to his sister.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wallaceme @theipaper I’m sorry, but to give in to bully tactics isn’t the right thing to do. You don’t weaken your government by having a key person resign, just because the media are inflicting a bit of damage on you currently. It only gives them then power to do what they want, when they want<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mancmikeyb @theousherwood Well considering he wasn’t feeling great, his wife was needed in the car yes. The child wouldn’t then stay in the house alone. They got out of the car for air when he felt sick, just before they went home. They weren’t even there long, so I really don’t get you fixation on it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KittyKatPK @Rylan Except Dom broke no rules on social distancing. Up to you whether you want to risk family in an enclosed space before the Gov and advisors say it’s safe to do so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rylan No doubt by then, you’ll be able to have your mother in your house. He’s clearly giving shops notice to prepare social distancing ready for opening. I doubt you’d have to do much preparation in the same way as a department store 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The rules in a public vote - aka the EU referendum, is that however the public votes, parliament implements it. You spent years trying to stop Brexit, because you thought you were too important to do as the public asked. Don’t dare preach the moral high ground. #DominicStays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny how Labour are now saying that #DominicCummnings should resign or be sacked because it’s what the public want. If they’d do what the public ‘want’, why did they spend years trying to stop Brexit, in clear breach of what the public voted in the referendum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lisanandy I remember it wasn’t too long ago, you were saying you and Labour were too important to listen to the electorate who voted to leave. You ignored them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@William_Wragg Stop talking about it then and we can all move on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, and what have we seen outside his parents house since, oh yes, the media. Says it all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mancmikeyb @theousherwood He was cleared to drive back to London for work. He went for a shorter drive locally to see if he was ok to do a full drive as his wife was still worried. I’ve done that myself before, so I don’t think there’s any harm in that. They didn’t go out for a day out as is suggested.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theousherwood I just don’t understand why people are getting facts inaccurate. Dominic didn’t visit anybody, broke no social distancing and no 2m rule. Therefore, I don’t get how it can be compared to the fact others didn’t visit loved ones etc. Neither did he.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohannaSaunders @PippaCrerar @guardian @DailyMirror Except it was a lie and Dominic has proof he was not in Durham at the time. Media bullshitting as usual.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itstrisha_innit @afneil @SkyNews So give in to bullies? I don’t think so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afneil @SkyNews The media need to be reigned in. They are disgusting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iromg The Guardian, Daily Mirror, Daily Mail and Metro please, Mike.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 He did as you asked, no more he can do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where else is a sick person meant to go? That’s what hospitals are for. We have some loony people around 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All created by the #MediaScum, who I will add, don’t follow social distancing or the clear 2m rule. Will the public realise the media tried to hoodwink them with false reporting and inaccurate claims? I hope so🤞🏼 #ImWithDom &amp; #Boris. #mondaythoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ACunninghamMP Labour as professional as usual. Grow up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonlfc12 @GayBakerleaver @JH_Campbell @DPJHodges @uncleporkie You need to get your facts right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beth Rigby is shit at her job. That is all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Get a life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelChapmanJ He bloody got the Tories the majority. The whole Election campaign was his strategy. I thinks he’s great and the Tories would lose a lot if he was gone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iromg As if. Her whole life’s work has been based on bogus reporting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PippaCrerar @danbloom1 We’ve all turned our forensic hand to all of your reports, and they’re all bullshit with more holes than a sponge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Retail will start re-opening in June. Yaaaay! Open up the UK economy is vital!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelChapmanJ He drove for around 30 mins to see if he could deal with a long drive. Understandable.  So if he’d stayed in London and both parents had become severely ill, who would have looked after the child? It was quite right to move to a house nearer to his sister in my opinion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrdanwalker Too bloody right. The media have spread lies and inaccurate reports. They have caused the confusion unnecessarily.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well said, Tom. In complete agreement. The media circus and inaccurate reporting has been quite embarrassing and sickening to watch. #DailyBriefing #bbcnews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m sure all the lefties would have done things do much better...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikegalsworthy A child has to be looked after by somebody if they parents are incapacitated. A 17 yr old is a the least risk. I think any sensible person could see that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just hope it cuts through and the media false reporting by the media hasn’t confused the public.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well said. I do hope enough people watched it. It’s worth No10 &amp; @Conservatives putting it readily available on social media for people to watch. The media are not trustworthy enough to report accurately. #bbcnews #DailyBriefing #DowningStreetBriefing #IStandWithDom &amp; #Boris.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Key take home from #DominicCummngs Downing Street #Pressconference is that you can’t believe what you read in newspapers and in the media. All they do is spread lies, mistruths and put out inaccurate reports that sow confusion. The #ScumMedia should be ashamed of spreading lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afneil Because his house was being hounded by the press and there was no separate house for them to stay in. Are you really that dense that you can’t understand that? He made it quite clear why London was not the best place @afneil<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any confusion in the public is because the MEDIA make inaccurate claims. The MEDIA are a disgrace &amp; can’t competently do their jobs. They spread lies, inaccurate reports &amp; cause confusion. Dominic Cummings acted reasonably and broke NO rules. I support him and Boris. #ScumMedia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The media disgust me. If people are confused, it’s because the media have been reporting inaccurate facts. If they didn’t try ‘gotcha’ journalism we wouldn’t be in this situation. I’m ashamed of the media. #IStandWithDC as he’s done nothing wrong. #ScumMedia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The statement from #dominiccummings has made things very clear. He’s in a very responsible job, it was a very complex situation and he made a decision based on his wife being ill, his child and himself likely to be. His house being targeted was another factor. #IStandWithDC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@BethRigby is a vile, nasty poisonous bitch indeed. #ScumMedia #DailyBriefing #IStandWithDC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lush weather today. Hopefully everyone is enjoying #BankHolidayMonday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@talkRADIO Nope,  it confirmed my thoughts that the media are like vultures and hate the government regarding Brexit. The only people breaking social distancing are the media packing around Dominics house. He didn’t even break the 2m rule.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lord_Sugar What do you think of the fact that Dominic didn’t actually break social distancing rules and yet the media are, by packing together like sardines around Dom’s house? How can the likes of @piersmorgan ever be credible if he doesn’t call out the media. Absolute joke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afneil This is pathetic. @afneil lowering his standards to @piersmorgan level. Grotesque media. You can agree or not with Cummings, but he didn’t break social distancing rules. The media on the other hand are, by swarming around Dom’s house, but I note the complete silence on that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And is why they are throwing everything at trying to turn the public against Boris<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Re-run of Brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sueperkins The remain elite wanting to punish Boris and Dom for Brexit, in disguise that it is over this 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly right Will, well said. I’ve been saying this for weeks. The media don’t want to help inform the public of actual facts, or promote positivity to keep morale going. They have always been about negative hysteria and misleading the public at every opportunity. Shameful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Deaths from #coronavirus in the UK are at a massive low this weekend, showing that the trend is positive. PPE &amp; testing both in excess supply. Progress being made on track &amp;  trace, inc the app. Way too many positives for the media. So..they keep the Dominic Cummings story going.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The media have never cared about helping to inform the public. Throuout this pandemic, all the media have done is try ‘gotcha’ questions to try and bring the Government down. The MSM have been a disgrace since Brexit, and have just shown themselves to be even worse now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anna_Soubry You’re a disgrace. Hope you’re enjoying life after being sacked by the public.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They vote Labour, they are not sensible people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewRTDavies They’ll probably waste it, as usual<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kaneykaneykane You’re thick as mince. Dom hasn’t risked any lives, so I find it very hard to understand any reasoning for your tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve come to the conclusion that the majority of people can’t understand simple facts. Dominic Cummings DID NOT take his child to the grandparents or anybody else for that matter. He simple decided to self isolate in a house that was ‘nearby’ to family, but a SEPARATE house.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shawry1984 @BorisJohnson You do realise that Dominic didn’t take his child to anybody else don’t you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can the rest of Europe please get their act together and release their true fucking death figures. Why does it take so long to release accurate numbers for community and carehomes deaths. I’m sick of the UK media saying we have the highest deaths in Europe, when we don’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IsabelOakeshott Wow. You really have turned into scum now. You know full well that most European countries haven’t released full death figures that include carehomes and community deaths, yet you spout the very inaccurate conclusion we are the second worst in the world. Deceitful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When are the Welsh Government (Labour) going to actually outline a timeline of how they will ease things. I smes is like a third world country atm. Nobody or no business can plan effectively with no dates. Sort it out @fmwales<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TonyBellew I agree with your principle, but at least get the full facts right. He didn’t drive to drop his child off. He drove to self isolate nearer his sisters house. If people can’t get the facts right after 2 days of it constantly being explained, then this country is fuc£ed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am absolutely sick to the back teeth of @piersmorgan and the whole elite media bunch. It doesn’t matter what Boris or the Government do, they have it in for them. Constant lies, mistruths, inaccurate reports and attempts to mislead the public. Boris is the PM. Get over it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucyEllam85 Who did Dominic Cummings expose the virus too? Oh that’s right, NOBODY.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrFrancesRyan He doesn’t need to say fuck all to anybody on his child. The end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JojoblogsJo It doesn’t take hold that quickly. Don’t be so ridiculous. At that point he wasn’t ill, but was likely to become ill in the days ahead as he’d been near his wife and Boris. So it was not irresponsible at all. He came into contact with nobody outside his wife and child<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JojoblogsJo He didn’t go to see his parents or any family. He travelled to self isolate nearer to his sisters, just encase him &amp; his wife got to ill to look after the child. His wife already being ill now. They self isolated at the property. Nobody on the road was endangered, why would they?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think the @Conservatives need to up their political attacks. Can’t let Labour and the media spread rubbish and not counter it. Come on #BorisJohnson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulwaugh @Jamin2g He only has a seat cos of Cummings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oliverleith Scum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m thinking it’s all Brexit related personally. The media going in for the kill to destroy the key person who helped deliver it, and a Tory majority. The problem...too many people might fall for the inaccurate reports.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AtherRob I think that too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m confused. What exactly is the outrage? Dominic travelled to self isolate nearer to his sister. His wife was ill &amp; likely he would too. Just encase they both got seriously ill, they had to think of the vulnerable child. No social distancing rules broken. #BorisJohnson - 👏🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryHynds Twitter is a shower of shit atm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Dominic never broke social distancing, so why is it ok for them too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KayBurley You must be gutted, but like you were last year when he shat all over the media lies to get Brexit done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sack them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PobertReston @BorisJohnson Opinion on made up reports with more inaccuracies than you’ve had hit dinners<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lord_Sugar @martinjdwareham Don’t we all 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeFreemanMP Dominic Cummings didn’t take his child to grandparents, so don’t really see your point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@montie Can’t keep coming back over an over again about the same thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can the media not work technology? 🙄 #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesallyrawlins @BorisJohnson Dominic Cummings never broke any social distancing or the 2m rule, yet the media do. Everything should stick to that, that’s quite clear. Nice attitude though Sally, bring it down to the gutter, where I assume you live. Stay safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSmithsonPB There was no evidence today. It’s all inaccurate reports.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesallyrawlins @BorisJohnson Cummings followed all social distancing and guidelines. You clearly haven’t read them. He self isolated for 2 weeks with his wife and child in a separate house, near to his family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly my thoughts. So proud of @BorisJohnson in standing up to the media onslaught in this. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Strong leadership from @BorisJohnson. So proud he has stood up the the media. The harassment of Dominic Cummings by the media is disgusting, who don’t seem to have the ability to stick to the social distancing rule. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulBrandITV It’s humiliating for the media. It’s harassment. Also, the media should start adhering the 2m distancing rule, something Dom hasn’t broken.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope @BorisJohnson stays firm at 5PM &amp; doesn’t let the media’s harassment of Dominic result in his resignation. Nobody should be subjected to this kind of media parade, esp when they haven’t broken any rules &amp; have adhered to social distancing throughout. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyParkes @JuliaHB1 No family in London to help if they both got seriously ill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IainDale Ridiculous. Dominic never broke social distancing and the 2m rule.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‘Looked’ being they key part. More inaccurate media reports to try and force somebody they don’t like to resign. I saw somebody who ‘looked’ like Freddie Krueger, but I’m doubtful it was him.  The media harassment of Dominic Cummings is an absolute disgrace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You have to think who holds the media to account when they lie, spread #fakenews &amp; mislead the public with inaccurate reports. It’s seem as though they can do what they want. I’ve also seen videos today of none of them following the 2m rule when harassing #DominicCummngs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s a witch hunt to drive him out because he helped deliver Brexit. Most of us can see that.  Boris has two options, he either shows leadership &amp; stands firm with Dom (who has broken no rules or social distancing) &amp; calls out the media lies, or allows them to bully Dom out...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They’d all boycotted the show anyway 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‘Looked’ like Dominic Cummings. Clear made up story by the scum at @DailyMirror. Sick of lies and inaccurate reports from the media to try and bully somebody out of their job. More about Brexit. Classic Dom stand firm, you’ve done nothing wrong. #dominicsgoings #Marr #Ridge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Boris let’s Dominic resign, we are a weaker country than we were before. Nobody should be harassed and bullied out by the media, especially when they have done nothing wrong. There are clear safeguarding reasons for going out, and no rules on social distancing were broken.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samholdertv @SkyNews This is bullying, harassment and libel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@montie Disagree. If he’s fired for doing nothing wrong, it sends a message the media can bully people out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@legsidelizzy @lambertvictoria But where would you have stayed? Dominic Cummings stayed in a separate house and did not mix.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will lose faith in the Government if Boris lets Dominic resign, due to the hounding of media pressure. People now saying they can interrupt the rules &amp; have BBQs, parties etc are pathetic. He hasn’t broken the rules of not mixing households &amp; self isolated separately to family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 That’s quite an irresponsible thing to say, as we know how easily some will believe. Whether you agree with Dominic or not, he didn’t mix socially with anybody other than his wife and child. He self isolated in a separate house and has stuck to the 2m rule throughout.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LukeEclair I think you’ll find @PippaCrerar has thrown her down the toilet. Then again, her reputation before was one of inaccuracy and incompetence. No10 has slammed the inaccuracy of the ‘second’ report as more bull.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nicxsy1 @10DowningStreet @PippaCrerar Try not to get too dirty on the floor..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amna_T_Ahmad The one that’s been slammed by No10 already 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hansmollman Cos she is wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hansmollman Well Pippa got it wrong, as has she has again on the second ‘story’. All she’s done is make herself look incompetent as she keeps leading with inaccurate stories. Obviously all the lefties will love her as she’s trying to bring down the Government, but what’s new really. #Marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tarajaneoreilly @PippaCrerar More made up bullshit already slammed by No10<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMendozaWoman But Dom didn’t ‘visit’ family members. He didn’t actually enter any house that his parents or sister was in. Pippa has inaccurate reports, both Saturday and Sunday. It’s becoming a weekly accuracy the incompetence from her. Luckily for her, the media are allowed to lie to sell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamBoad Apart from the fact No10 have already said it’s a pack of lies. Game over Pippa. More lies and gutter journalism. Getting boring now. If scum reporting was award winning, @PippaCrerar would have first prize. I’ve been following her word for a while, and it’s all inaccurate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@L1ND4K The news? Half of the ‘news’ is made up by the mirror and guardian. It’s pathetic to anybody but lefties who want to try and bring down the Government<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamiemd31 Says the clock. Past your bedtime I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RosamundUrwin @PippaCrerar @matthew_weaver So needed? The public don’t need poisonous, lying scum like them. No10 have stated clear the stories are inaccurate. If you call that reporting, you seriously need help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In most jobs, if somebody is incompetent at their job and spreads lies and mistruths, they would be given disciplinary action. It seems to be successful in the media, you just need to mislead the public with some bullshit stories and you’re amazing. Pippa being an example. #Marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ninjapotato10 @PeteWishart Masterclass in lying. No10 have already called it a masterclass of BULLSHIT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveLyn00188488 @Iromg @10DowningStreet What point are you trying to make then? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan We’ve known that the media lie for a long time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan You can’t say it’s the second worst in the world when most European countries have NOT release the excess deaths or their full death figures for care homes/community etc. You’re pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@francisobrienUK Seems so. Polls are back to that, arguments are and the media are at their worst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HScrymer Ha! Only if you stick to Scottish affairs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who loves #DominicCummngs (typo not mine) 👇🏼 Or do you prefer Mirror and Guardian ? 🤢 #Marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveLyn00188488 @Iromg @10DowningStreet Brexit is done, as in we’ve left the European Union. The trade deal will need to be done this year and transition period will end at the end of the year. If you think you’re gunna catch me out, you’re v wrong mate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kingkonggeorge It’s a pandemic, people will die unfortunately. We do not know the full excess deaths in other countries, as you are quoting for this country. At EVERY step the Government has followed the science. PPE has never run out, NHS never been overwhelmed. Stop lying. You are stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kingkonggeorge What a load of bollocks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As predicted.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s what the media rely on sadly....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SmartBusSol @Iromg @guardian @DailyMirror Exactly, he hasn’t even come into contact with anybody.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ms_sjmini14 @DPJHodges @uncleporkie You’ve surely read his statement and reasons. Either way, he put NOBODY at risk as he didn’t come into contact with anybody outside his household.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peston Dominic Cummings sleeps in the same bed as his wife for more than 6hrs a night and they live together. It wouldn’t make a blind bit of difference being in the car with her. This is ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love this 😂  Pippa @PippaCrerar is not a serious journalist. She is a lying scum reporter who constantly writes #fakenews stories in the awful lefty rag that is ‘The Daily Mirror’. If anything, she needs to resign for incompetence. Usual scum media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The media are fishy. Period. It’s the same as the perfectly timed stories before Conservative conference last year. The media hate the fact Dom helped get Brexit done. The media elite have been a disgrace for months. It doesn’t shock me. Dom and @BorisJohnson need to stand firm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @GMB 😂🤣 You’ve been moaning all week that cabinet ministers have been boycotting @GMB for the past 3 weeks. Now you’re banning them? They don’t want to come on you arrogant plank &amp; haven’t done for weeks. I can’t stop laughing. Petulant child.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonlfc12 The Tories arnt going to call an election. We arnt in the same times anymore. They have a thumping majority. Labour have to get used to that fact. It’ll be 2024 the next election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonlfc12 4.5 years at the earliest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonlfc12 Bitter aren’t you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SocialM85897394 They are only interested in negative spin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonlfc12 This is getting boring now. I don’t trust Labour or the media no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonlfc12 They didn’t say what family and Dominic denied it in his statement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Far more important than talking endlessly about Dominic Cummings 👇🏼#DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonlfc12 Erm, they said he took his child for his parents to look after. He didn’t. They said the police were involved. They weren’t. They always get it wrong.  Trusted? 🤣😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonlfc12 For one, I don’t read papers, secondly you keep believing what the Mirror and Gurdian keep telling you. The fact they keep getting it wrong should say something, but then again, you don’t care about all the Labour lies, so clearly makes you scum of the earth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonlfc12 Oh yes, that lefty rag. Both the Mirror and Guardian are about as trustworthy as a compulsive liar. Bore off mate and keep dreaming about getting kier as PM. He has no chance. Let the Tories remain in power for years to come<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonlfc12 He didn’t go to see his parents. Why are his parents being mentioned? Nothing to do with them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alantwill @traingirl83 2 weeks later? He was in isolation for 2 weeks. So the timings are a bit puzzling. But it’s no wonder when the lefty rags are the ones reporting. They got the first report completely wrong and made up it was his parents and the police were involved<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@traingirl83 @alantwill I’m actually pissed off with the tweet. Dom Cummings never went to see his parents. That’s been made clear. He never came into contact with anybody and remained isolated in a separate household. I don’t see what point is being made about not clapping for the NHS? Disingenuous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@traingirl83 @alantwill Dear @traingirl83. Dominic Cummings never went to see his parents. He went to self isolate closer to his sister and self isolated with his wife and child in a separate house to both parents &amp; sister.  He never risked anybody’s health as he didn’t come into contact with ANYBODY.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonlfc12 Whenever somebody is infection or not, Dom didn’t not come into contact with others. So what’s your issue? Oh yes, you’re a Labour leftie and Dom forced Labour to their worst election defeat in decades. Must be so bitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickeardleybbc Even if this is true, he was living in Durham then (after isolating) and he works in London. We are allowed (and always have been) to travel for work. Again, the media trying everything they can do push him out. Yes we know the media hate Government for delivering Brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonlfc12 The rules state isolate for 2 weeks after showing symptoms, or longer if you still have symptoms. You are not infectious after this prick. Matt Hancock was back in work and doing press conferences after he completed his 2 weeks in isolation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lord_Sugar @piersmorgan Resign hopefully<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyTNewton He didn’t see family. The rules have always stated that you can deliver food to family and friends, so you have been able to do that. He isolated separately to parents and sister, he purely went to Durham to be ‘nearer’ to them, just encase he needed child support.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do love this man. At the end of the day, no rules were broken and he didn’t mix with anybody other than his household, which was his wife and child. He moved to self isolate in Durham, just encase he and his wife became too sick and needed to be closer to his sis. End of story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All about sensationalism to the media, bringing down the Government and destroying the people who delivered Brexit. That majorly includes Dominic Cummings. He must stay firm and remain at the heart of Government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YesitsmeDigby @OliverDowden It wasn’t a visit. Look at the actual full guidelines.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan You’ve humiliated yourself with your aggressive bullying for no reason. No rules were broken and Cummings never mixed outside his household. People have no reason to stop abiding by social distancing and the only one that muddies the message is you.  Grow up for once.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonlfc12 They would have got fuel but before setting back, once they got rid of coronavirus and their lockdown had ended. So still not contact with others, and no longer infectious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@montie This was taken before most people knew the facts surrounding it. The press conference was only a few hrs ago ffs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RayGran68753429 @valuestoimpact @jonlfc12 @DPJHodges @uncleporkie Yes but at that point, they didn’t know how bad they’d get. Look how bad Boris was. They planned for the worst and decided selfi isolating in Durham near a his sister was the best option<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Triptraveler2 Cu@t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@strandedatsea @jonlfc12 @DPJHodges @uncleporkie At that specific time maybe, but he was planning ahead. He did in fact get much sicker.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZacGoldsmith It’s the lefty tossers out in force<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OCunasa @BenedictMPWhite There was a ban, but not if it’s for the protection of a vulnerable person, aka the child. It states you can then rely on a family network, which was in Durham. He risked no lives as he made contact with nobody. What’s the issue? Lefty? Remainer? Or both?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattGarrahan @h2005__uk No. He didn’t take his kids to his parents. He went to be closer to his sister (but in a separate house to both sister and parents). This would allow the sister to deliver food to him and who could step in with the child, if he and his wife became too ill. Do keep up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OCunasa @BenedictMPWhite His home that he was self isolating in was in Durham, where he travelled to make sure his sister could deliver food and look after the child, if both himself and his wife became too ill. In the rules, it allows for adjustments for vulnerable people, the child being just that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnmcdonnellMP What would be weak is Boris letting Cummings go, purely because the lefties and media try and bully him out. He’s done frig all wrong. The end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cummings followed the rules (which inc a point on vulnerable children of parents that are ill/becoming ill) &amp; actually didn’t come into contact with ANYBODY outside his household. He self isolated away from parents &amp; the sister. The below people don’t care about others then 👇🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the media keep missing out is that Dominic Cummings broke no rules, didn’t risk lives (as he was in a car and then in a separate house with his wife and child) and self isolated there for 2 weeks separately to the parents. No rules broken, no lives risked. What’s the story?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see the media just can’t get over this.... #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan He better survive. No way should a nasty pack of media bullies like you push him out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I bloody love Dominic Cummings. He made the left and remainiacs go crazy last year, he helped @BorisJohnson &amp; @Conservatives win a thumping majority, whilst also helping to get Brexit done. He’s now got the media &amp; lefties hysterically having a meltdown. Genius.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@piersmorgan has seriously lost the plot. The media are absolutely pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reminder: Dom did not break any two metre distance, did not come into contact with anybody outside his household &amp; acted reasonably for their child when him &amp; his wife were likely to become v ill. He travelled by car to isolate ‘closer’ to his sisters. Media: Break two metre rule<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When even a Labour Momentum poll has the answer at no, you know it’s laughable and a non story. Dom did nothing wrong, travelled north to be ‘nearer’ to his sister (but no contact made) as he and his wife were likely to become v ill and they had a young child.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂🤣🤣🤣 The media not following the rules.... tut tut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmmaKennedy Erm, it was his sister for one not his parents. Also, he didn’t expose anybody as he stayed in a separate building to all family. I know you hate the Tories and Brexit, but you really should get your facts right first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iromg Let’s be serious @Iromg, it’s a non story. It’s clear from the No10 statement, he acted reasonably and had his reasons. This has created a media and lefty/remainer meltdown. It’s more about him helping to get Brexit done and delivering a Tory majority than anything else...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And he travelled by car, came into non contact with anybody, isolated in a separate building to his sister &amp; parents. He sister was then able to deliver food to the door for them, rather than them go outside. He acted reasonably &amp; within the guidelines. This is more about Brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. If they did become seriously ill (like Boris), then his sister was close by to take the child. They were also close to the sister, so she could deliver food to the house while they were in isolation (which was also allowed). Hysterical media and lefties...Brexit haters?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let’s hope (not holding my breath) that the media can also apologise for their hysterical over the top remarks and tweets. Over to the likes of @PippaCrerar @bbclaurak @piersmorgan ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deGourlay That’s completely different. That was a leisure/pleasure trip, this wasn’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 @piersmorgan It was his sister he went to be nearer, so that she could bring over food, not parents. Let’s get it clear. Also, no contact was made.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anshul__K @piersmorgan Was actually his sister, so the media haven’t even got that right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the @DailyMirror @PippaCrerar @guardian made a complete balls up of the story. No police involved. Wasn’t involving his parents, but his sister - who dropped off food outside. Was a separate house in Durham &amp; no physical contact made. As usual, more bullshit from lefty rags.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amarsmusicshow @BBCNews He didn’t break any. In exceptional cirmcumstances, you can leave if you need to sort child care arrangements out. Him and his wife went to be nearer to his sister, and she shopped for them. No physical contact was made. Worse if he’d stayed in London.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s absolutely hilarious. I’ve not seen such a big meltdown since Brexit. It shows that the remainers, lefties and media elite haven’t got over Brexit. They want to destroy the Government (as we’ve seen for months) and now Dominic because he helped deliver Brexit. Pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @BorisJohnson He hasn’t done anything wrong. He went near to his sister so that she could drop off food (rather than him and his wife going out and infecting people) and came into contact with nobody. All perfectly reasonable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dominic Cummings only travelled to be nearer to family, just encase him &amp; his wife became to ill to care for their child. His sister brought food &amp; left it outside the house, which is better than two infected people going shopping in London themselves. No issues. #dominicgoings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here we go....REMAINER MELTDOWN.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nutts_mutts @DPJHodges @uncleporkie Doesn’t mean they were too sick at that time. But might have not wanted to get worse in London<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charlesarthur @rmf719630 Every situation is diff, and we don’t know the full circumstances for Dom. If I was getting sick, and I had a child in my care, then I’d be thinking of all plausible options. I might decide that. Whatever I did, I wouldn’t use public transport, as Dom didn’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@puffin1952 @NeilJamesWeekes No, because a lot of Europe have higher deaths, just haven’t released full death figures yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charlesarthur @rmf719630 I do recall, but the media were still foaming at the mouth when it first broke... and I remember a lot calling for his resignation. I think people need to calm down and wait to see if Dominic says more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @BorisJohnson Get a life @piersmorgan. Need some positive energy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charlesarthur @rmf719630 The media were going crazy over @RobertJenrick too. He never resigned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charlesarthur @rmf719630 I’m sure we will get a statement at some point though...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charlesarthur @rmf719630 Neil Ferguson was letting somebody enter his home and was not social distancing from them. Dom was self isolating separately and it wasn’t a ‘visit’ as he remained there isolated. Completely different. Neil resigned freely. The Scottish CMO was visiting too, not covid related.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhh Dominic Cummings...ohhhh Dominic Cummings... #OneGoodThing - I’m laughing at how hard the media are pushing this one. As predicted, top story on @BBCNews...the remain elite just haven’t got over Brexit 🤣 Classic Dom strikes again... #GotBrexitDone 🇬🇧🍻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charlesarthur @rmf719630 Children are less likely to pass it on,but I’m not saying there is no risk no &amp; general advice is against. Let’s also be clear, this was a couple of months ago when less was known. The child had to go somewhere, so wherever he went, there was risk. It was exceptional circumstance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pickod @t_stephens77 If I didn’t mix with them, then not at risk are they.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rmf719630 The infected person didn’t come into contact with the parents. Isolated separately<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charlesarthur @DrGABaines @PippaCrerar @bbclaurak His wife was ill too. If they were getting sicker, what was he meant to do with the child? Look how ill Boris got, he was probably aware how he could get and wanted the child with family. Where else does the child go?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pickod @t_stephens77 He might not have been at that time, but if I was getting sicker and so was my wife, I’d want my child with family. Guess you don’t have children? Or would you want them with social services instead? 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rmf719630 As if ANY parent would let their child be taken by social services when there’s family to look after them. What a load of absolute shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charlesarthur @DrGABaines @PippaCrerar @bbclaurak So what should he have done with the child if getting v ill?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rmf719630 They were visiting for leisure. He was going there to take his child to be looked after, where he then self isolated separately.  What do you think he should have done if he’s getting too ill to look after the child? Let the child look after themself?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charlesarthur @DrGABaines @PippaCrerar @bbclaurak No rules broken. Went to family in exceptional circumstances and self isolated there.  https://t.co/AHexowyLMY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pickod @t_stephens77 But it was still applicable then. He was sick and the child needed looking after. He took him to his parents and self isolated there in a separate part of the house. No issues there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonlfc12 @DPJHodges @uncleporkie It says in circumstances where you are unable to look after your child, then you can go to family. They just happen to be far away. He then isolated at the house, so no contact made.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonlfc12 @DPJHodges @uncleporkie He went to family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonlfc12 @DPJHodges @uncleporkie  https://t.co/rqLwpiFgtf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@t_stephens77  https://t.co/qRdctF2jhH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remainers (inc the majority of the media elite) v Brexiteers (and the people who respect democracy) feud is back. Cummings has got right under their skin and they will do anything to try and get him out. Classic Dom should stay exactly where he is. He hasn’t broken rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonlfc12 @DPJHodges @uncleporkie If he’s seriously ill, and his wife is, and the child needs to be looked after, that is exceptional cirmcumstances and is allowed in the rules. Check it out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All remainers will do everything to keep this going and to get him out, purely because he got the Tories a majority and thus, got Brexit done. As long as he stays firmly where he is, it might just bring Brexit to the front again...could do with Brexit talk again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbclaurak @slay4ever007 You mean you’re desperate to keep it going. Many people hate him because he helped tho Tories deliver brexit and get a huge majority. He should stay firm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CatharineHoey Especially when both of you are ill and you have a child. There were no rules broken.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Classic Dom got the media going nuts on this story 😂🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love how Classic Dom really gets under the skin of the remain elite media. They’re frothing at the mouth about this story. Shows them up for what they are. Don’t think they’ll ever get over #Brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@montie So if they both got as ill as Boris, what happens to the child? Same thing that they did. And they were in a separate part of his parents home. Non story. Says a lot that all journalists are talking about this than anything else<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrGABaines @PippaCrerar @bbclaurak So no mixing and necessary. Non sorry as you say, journalists creaming themselves tho 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrGABaines @PippaCrerar @bbclaurak What’s the story then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPJHodges @uncleporkie If himself and his wife were v sick, then the kids needed to be looked after. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s laughable how much journalists are creaming themselves over the story about Dominic Cummings quarantining at his parents home. Frig off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rodbishop15 Clearly there’s no magic, but the idea is that it reduces contact severely after the initial travel. Most people at this point won’t be showing symptoms.  It may only need to be in place for a few weeks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smally32 @johnrayitv @itvnews Parliament is going back after half term. Plus schools are only opening to 15 size classes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnrayitv @itvnews The Government is advised by the scientists and the medical experts. The teachers are not the experts here, nor are the unions. Therefore, the parents are trusting the wrong people and more damage will be done to children with no education of social interaction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tobysdad41 @pritipatel @MattHancock The money went straight into funding the NHS. The same people saying it’s wrong, apparently would love to pay more tax to fund the critical NHS. What is it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TiceRichard @pritipatel There’s no closing of any borders. It’s just self isolate when you get here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ellie6 @BorisJohnson They wouldn’t. Restrictions from people arriving were made early on for places like China &amp; N. Italy, however, as 99% of flights were cancelled &amp; infections were rife here, it wouldn’t make a diff. Now it would. Deaths are not comparable with Europe as they arnt accurate there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully this is only needed for a couple of months max.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthea_bailey Said the same. They are thick as, still not understanding<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ellie6 @BorisJohnson Why would the Governmwnt want to borrow hundreds of billions, destroy the economy and cause all the issues we face? They wouldn’t. If you honestly think that they’ve done it on outside, you’ve lost the plot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ellie6 @BorisJohnson This is why the Government is easing restrictions and the lockdown. However, it is a very tight balancing act and atm the Gov are damned if they do, damned if they don’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My two favourite radio presenters at the moment are definitely @JuliaHB1 and @Iromg. They are fair, robust in their questioning and not completely  delusional like so many others in their field. Keep doing what you do guys!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @JuliaHB1 You certainly know the size of a large ego.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The problem is @NicolaSturgeon is the biggest player of party political games. In the early days of this crisis she was invited to the UK COBRA meetings &amp; would immediately announce things straight after it, before the UK PM. She always wants the limelight on her. #NotALeader<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Starmer is very slippery &amp;  untrustworthy. Now agreeing with the Labour affiliated unions to both protect their donations and to try &amp; score some political points, by going against the Government. Children don’t matter to Labour, workers don’t matter to Labour, power does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly the reason that @BorisJohnson and the Government are trying to ease the lockdown. I do feel that the lockdown easing needs to pick up pace, otherwise it will be very true that we get more deaths from the lockdown measures than #coronavirus. #StayAlert #BankHolidayWeekend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great stuff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m not surprised. The UK media hate  the Government after Brexit and they hate anything positive. Only thing you’ll hear from the media is lies, negative stories, misleading information, ‘gotcha’ questions and sensationalism. #coronavirus #FridayFeeling #FridayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@poorscousertom @michaelgove The official SAGE group (who advises Government) says the opposite. As the official group is not filled completely with biased Labour cronies like the ‘independent SAGE’, I’ll go with them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewButtery3 @piersmorgan @GavinWilliamson @cyclingkev @chrisdysonHT @NEUnion Except that is not the official SAGE group. It’s a shadow group.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@poorscousertom @michaelgove Except that is not the official SAGE group. It’s a shadow group.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@louiseatkinso14 Except that is not the official SAGE group. It’s a shadow group.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That not the official SAGE group. Jeez.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Labour are now quoting the non official SAGE group, trying to mislead the public yet again. How is this woman in the shadow cabinet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Italy's death toll in March and April could be 19,000 higher than official figures suggest, its social security agency says.  As we have all been saying, once the true figures are released, sadly Italy will have far more deaths from #coronavirus than the UK.  The UK media:  https://t.co/lAkhZVSkUw<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @hassan_akkad @Keir_Starmer Now all you need to do, is come up with a way to fill the black hole of funding the NHS that this has left...if you scrap something that funds the NHS, you have to recoup it another way.

<|startoftext|>@Christo91361437 @BorisJohnson He just has 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Christo91361437 @BorisJohnson It’s about listening. I have many meetings at work and we reach a decision based on listening to all. A dictatorship leadership where the person doesn’t listen isn’t a leader<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All the Labour lefties saying it’s a win for them, maybe they can come up with how to  fill the funding hole left from taking this surcharge away. No doubt they have no credible solution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Twitter left yelling that the Government has done a massive u-turn on the #NHSSurcharge. @BorisJohnson has always said since becoming PM he wanted to listen to all views. Not a negative, it’s a positive if you are prepared to listen &amp; change policy accordingly. Great leadership!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yup. @NicolaSturgeon ripped into @BorisJohnson, yet has announced exactly the same thing, just a couple of weeks later.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@phil235471 It’s over the Parliament I believe, but was due to go up significant. Happy to agree to drop the surcharge, it just means that there now a big hole in NHS funding. It was said how people would be happy to pay more for NHS, but it seems the opposite<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@owskie81 @BethRigby @Keir_Starmer It’s about a billion over parliament I believe...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BethRigby @Keir_Starmer I remember last year people saying they didn’t mind paying more tax to fund the NHS. Now the same people pushing for the surcharge to be removed. That’s around a billion lost from NHS funding. Problem now is how to fund the hole...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Problem is, there’s now a 1billion black hole in NHS funding. The surcharge brought in around 1billion. Where does the money come from now? Many of the income areas have dried up. #NHSSurcharge<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Great news. Makes you wonder why it’s higher in other areas...complacency maybe? People assume they need to social distance in London, but now too much in more rural areas. Rural areas end up being worse then...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears @simonharrisitv @itvlondon I’m going by the figures from Government (as reported in various press conferences) that state 48% of the working population are working from home. If you then add in NHS, supermarket workers, garden centres, takeaways etc, well over 50% of the working population are working.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshSmithSpears @simonharrisitv @itvlondon I’ve not stopped. 50% of people are working from home<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never seen the garden so much in all my life since this lockdown. Thankfully it’s been generally warm and sunny the last two months. ☀️ #heatwave #HottestDayOfTheYear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not mentioned on @BBCNews at 6. Shock.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At the end of the day, the Government is taking advice from all the scientists in SAGE, and medical experts. It also has access to the scientific data. Experts have advised that it is safe to open schools for certain yrs. Councils that stop schools opening are playing politics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Huge increase, which is clearly down to the broadening of who can get tested, which is now available for everyone over 5yrs old. Get tested if you have symptoms. No doubt the media will find something negative to say... #DailyBriefing #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simonharrisitv @itvlondon Do people not work?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wouldn’t use the word pasted, but glad Boris made Starmer look like an idiot today. Much more aggressive push backs 👌🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Waiting for the opinion of @bbclaurak on who won PMQs....Showman v the Lawyer isn’t it? It was clearly a win for Boris, so unlikely she will say much today on it today.Forensic my arse. Starmer was next to useless and wasn’t even listening to the answers.

<|startoftext|>@deedub93 @FoxxysTweets @TerryCretin Makes the media out to be liars though, especially the likes of @piersmorgan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meaning the UK probably has one of the lowest death figures in Europe, the opposite to what the media tell you. If other countries haven’t released their full care home deaths, and it will amount to around 50% of all deaths, figures released so far are majorly inaccurate. #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When all European counties release their full death figures, that include care homes and communities (which they haven’t yet, even though we have) the UK will be nowhere near the worst. The media are trying to mislead the public, don’t fall for it. #PMQs #WednesdayWisdom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @GMB @BorisJohnson  https://t.co/mcwPPelVTa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rik_J_W Ed - just for the comical photos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big mistake in my eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rodbishop15 Media won’t be mentioning it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan PPE never run out. Testing capacity over 100k per day.  64% of Care Homes have no outbreak &amp; deaths are declining.  Airport checks were deemed pointless when widespread transmission.  ‘Herd immunity' was never Gov strategy.  Mass gatherings were stopped.  Lockdown was not late.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan All this is a lie. I could unpick every one of these, but it shows clear you have an agenda and facts don’t matter. Somebody needs to hold you to account. Media should not be misleading and reporting inaccurate information.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scary thing is, I think we could end up with more deaths indirectly from #Covid_19. People who are missing treatments, not going to hospital for strokes/heart attacks, suicides going up. This is why it is so hard to judge how quickly to ease the lockdown. Must stay positive tho!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are @BBCNews going to put positive things like this on? Are positive messages like this going to be mentioned in #PMQs or on #BBCQT? No, didn’t think so. Will the media  carry on misleading the public &amp; distorting the facts? Of course. Thanks god things were different in the war.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBCNews Strange decision<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To the EU lovers in the UK, what is there to love about how they are conducting themselves in negotiations?! The EU are trying to blackmail &amp; control this country. We would be like an annexation of the EU. That is not acceptable.  Great letter by our chief negotiator 👇🏼#brexit 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Labour affiliated teaching unions make me sick. It’s not about children to them, but politics. They should be deeply ashamed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The sad thing is, the UK Government are damned if they do, damned if they don’t. They could ease the lockdown much faster &amp; cause more covid-19 deaths, they could ease it slower &amp; cause more indirect #Covid_19 deaths (heart attacks, strokes, suicide etc). Massive balancing act.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@truth_slaker @Conservatives @BorisJohnson @RishiSunak As the PM, it’s a political decision. People are always quick to have a go, but he’s done lots to help people and that shouldn’t be easily forgotten. Obvs when we go into recession, he will have to manage the economy thought it too. But I’m glad it’s a Tory Gov, not Labour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@susannareid100 Your painful to watch &amp; listen too, that’s why I dnt bother anymore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Needs to be watched👇🏼  This @Conservatives Government has saved millions of businesses &amp; millions of jobs. No other country is doing as much for its workers than @BorisJohnson and @RishiSunak. #dailybriefings  https://t.co/69iUFiKGTy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan What other countries have reported full death figures? What other countries have reported excess deaths in full? You are comparing apples with cheese.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How’s that messy? Government said schools can START opening on 1 June. If they aren’t quite ready, then they’ll open a little later. What’s the issue? #MSMMeltdown #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This man needs to go 👇🏼 Lying shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@parmaham5 @NicolaSturgeon No mass gatherings are allowed today, and haven’t been for months. The Government have followed the scientific advice they been given. The target was 100,000 tests a day, which was met several times. We are going to carry on testing, even though our numbers are coming right down.  https://t.co/ugRmwtozVW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No surprise when you have the likes of @BBCNews misleading the public with inaccurate information (whilst leaving at crucial facts front then experts) and you have aggressive presenters such as @piersmorgan @KayBurley attacking ministers on a daily basis.

<|startoftext|>It isn’t going to happen. The EU really are underestimating the @BorisJohnson led, @Conservatives Government. #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thealbaway @Hybridcell1977 @NicolaSturgeon Didn’t say it would. But too many people in Scotland think the country voted for independence, and it didn’t. It voted to stay firmly locked into the union.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hybridcell1977 @NicolaSturgeon Which is likely to be on 28 May. See you then 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@talkRADIO Yes I do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_oatc_ @Baldockboro @darshnasoni @Emmabarnett @TamoorT It came out of the mouths of members of SAGE. How is that not proof, you complete imbecile<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hybridcell1977 @NicolaSturgeon You’re talking like we are separate. You are not independent, you are a part of the UK, whether you like it or not. Your PM is Boris. I know that must hurt, but it’s a fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gorstewart @BBCandrewkerr @NicolaSturgeon You mean she saw an opportunity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hybridcell1977 @NicolaSturgeon I think you need to re-look at your figures. I’m done with this pointless conversation. Come back to me when you’ve found a brain cell that works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_oatc_ @Baldockboro @darshnasoni @Emmabarnett @TamoorT Well I’m not the PM, and I do not have all the advice and recommendation from SAGE. However, I have heard what they have said and that is that it is safe to reopen schools for reception, yr1 and yr6.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Baldockboro @_oatc_ @darshnasoni @Emmabarnett @TamoorT SAGE have stated it is safe to open schools in a limited capacity. Which is what the Government is going to do. What’s wrong with that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Baldockboro @_oatc_ @darshnasoni @Emmabarnett @TamoorT You don’t publish everything, that way to much information. The public got confused apparently last week with a simple statement<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hybridcell1977 @NicolaSturgeon She is not the PM of the UK, and yes her decisions are based on politics, not the science. As is all her decisions are. Same as she didn’t go with the UK decisions from the referrendum result. She already classes Scotland as an independent nation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hybridcell1977 @NicolaSturgeon Death rate in Scotland is worse. Testing levels per 100k in Scotland is worse. But you think sturgeon is doing a good job?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hybridcell1977 @NicolaSturgeon Why are you quoting this? I know that on paper we do currently, but I also have a brain and understand that it’s only the case because other countries haven’t released full figures yet, that will change. Are you not clever enough to understand that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hybridcell1977 @NicolaSturgeon It’s not good, but it’s certainly not the 2nd highest in the world. Your going by excess deaths as well, which hasn’t been released in other countries fully yet. So you like using skewered stats that arnt like for like don’t you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hybridcell1977 @NicolaSturgeon Also, we are not second if you look at death rate, even in those inaccurate figures, I think you should re-evaluate how clever you think you are<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hybridcell1977 @NicolaSturgeon It’s not the second highest in the world as most countries have not released their figures for community and care home deaths. Therefore, the figures are inaccurate for other countries. Do keep up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hybridcell1977 @BBCandrewkerr @NicolaSturgeon Get stuffed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Baldockboro @_oatc_ @darshnasoni @Emmabarnett @TamoorT SAGE have recommended that, as the chief scientist/medical officer and deputy scientist/ medical officer has stated, who are also members of SAGE themselves. Do keep up. The advice hasn’t been published, but that advice has gone to ministers from them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@parmaham5 @NicolaSturgeon Testing is now above German levels, which app is the gold standard. Mass gatherings have never been ok, only household or 1 on 1 with other households. You’re just making the stuff up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCandrewkerr @NicolaSturgeon I thought she wanted everyone to remain staying at home for the foreseeable future, thereby controlling all Scottish lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is shameful is @NicolaSturgeon playing political games with peoples lives. Devolved nations contradicting Boris, Labour Councils refusing to open schools,   all basing their decisions on politics, not on science. The best scientific &amp; medical experts are advising the UK Gov.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_oatc_ @darshnasoni @Emmabarnett @TamoorT Ay? Are you completely stupid? The medical science has said to open the schools. Keep up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darshnasoni @Emmabarnett @TamoorT Either way, the scientific and medical experts with all the data, know a lot more than parents do. Parents can only guess. It’s a purely political decision by a Labour Council waiting to contradict the Conservative Government.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>People need to understand that the media are not fit for purpose anymore. Their agenda is to bring down the Brexit supporting Government. They will change the narrative to suit the agenda. If it no longer fits to attack, change the subject. #tuesdayvibes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@911Amelia @boho_daisies @GMB It’s ridiculous isn’t it. It’s like, are we meant to fall for this stuff? I certainly don’t want advice from that man. Selling our gold for cheap was the icing on the cake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @GMB get a load of Boris &amp; Government bashers on the show, stating the testing capacity isn’t good enough. Ay? Testing capacity is over 100k, and anybody with symptoms over 5 yrs old can be tested. We are testing more than Germany, which was hailed as gold standard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a load of rubbish. You can’t have the main slogan (to the whole population) saying get tested, if it’s only applicable if you have symptoms. That isn’t right. How desperate are @GMB in getting Gordon Brown on the show. Media are really sinking to new lows.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TonyWil29738019 Nope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting sick of Labour Councils, Labour affiliated Unions &amp; Labour activists playing party politics on the reopening of schools. They must open on 1 June if given the go ahead by Government and the experts advising them. No more games. #COVIDIDIOTS #TuesdayThoughts #lockdown2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amazing what you can do when both sides negotiate in good faith. Shame that the EU feel they need to try and blackmail the UK, whilst trying to steal our fish and keep us locked to their rules. The EU can get stuffed. #ImmigrationBill #TuesdayThoughts 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DarrenStrange10 All? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Exp13Sa That’s inaccurate. The advice was given to Government by SAGE on different options for opening schools.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Vaccine by September IF the trials are successful. If they arn’t, it could be back to the drawing board. Grow the fuck up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Oh grow up. Slip of the tongue and you know it. These experts are working tirelessly to advise government and save lives and all you want to do is hate on them for saying the wrong day by accident. #BeKind ffs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KateWilton1 The relevant Secretary of State does the press conference. What’s the big deal? He’s working tirelessly to coordinate the Government response<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clear that the likes of Bury Council (Labour) are making decisions purely based on wanting to oppose the Government, at the expense of children. Stating the decision by Government is ill-advised is completely tosh. Gov decisions are made from medical &amp; scientific expert advice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwlbertaHoot @TamoorT @BuryCouncil @JenWilliamsMEN @BuryActiveWomen @BBCBreaking @DailyMirror @MENnewsdesk @BuryNorthLabour @BuryLabour @BurySchools You mean ignore the scientists and medical experts advising the Government. The decision is based on their advice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bury Council (Labour) are ignoring all of the medical experts advising the Government. They are ignoring all the scientists in SAGE that are advising the Government. They are idiots &amp; will end up damaging the lives of some of the most vulnerable children. Why? Purely political.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanielHewittITV ill-advised? It’s come from all the medial and scientific experts. The scientist group SAGE has advised the Government it is safe to open, so basically saying that the scientists are rubbish and ignoring their advice. Actually disgusting attitude<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GMB @piersmorgan @susannareid100 Why was he in a care home at 68 then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour and @Keir_Starmer can’t be trusted. Ever.  These days, opposition parties just disagree with the Governemnt for the sake of it. They feel they can’t possibly agree with the @Conservatives, even when it’s what is right for the country. #mondaythoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So basically the same as what @BorisJohnson has said 🙄 He just gave people more notice of the steps he would be taking. She just wanted to disagree with a @Conservatives Government to score some points. Pathetic. She’s also using the word ‘vigilant’, which is basically ‘alert’.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPJHodges Problem is, some don’t want to go back to work as their being paid to not work. Granted the minority, but it can’t be denied. It’s the summer pretty much...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But the media said no....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewRTDavies @WalesPolitics Honestly, The Labour welsh government have been a complete disaster throughout. Constant mess ups! Thank god they arn’t in No10.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So true👇🏼. The media would have demanded the exact plans for attacks on Germany, for ‘transparency’, then leaked them to Germany and the world. They would have been screaming at the Government about loss of lives, the fact they weren’t doing enough to protect the economy etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamCoatesSky Seems it’s going back to political views. If your Labour, you don’t approve etc. I think the Government is working tirelessly to get us through that, and I don’t think they could do more. Gentle easing, and following the scientific and medical experts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KayBurley Care homes have the elderly and vulnerable in them, which covid 19 targets. School children are not the same category and are much safer. Also the infection has already peaked. You’d know that, if you paid more attention.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rodbishop15 I get that, but the problem with releasing stuff like this that is already 2 weeks out of date and so isn’t accurate anymore (as it’s changing so rapidly), all you do is give the media new narratives that arn’t really true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardBurgon Not exactly working for minimum wage though are they. They aren’t working, don’t have to travel and in some cases are being topped up by the company they work for.  The Government paying 80% of wages in unprecedented and more than most countries. Only Labour can find an issue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rodbishop15 Biggest question is why release the R rate from 2 weeks ago<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PoliticsForAlI People are still far to swayed by a lying corrupt media<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kempernorton @SkyNewsBreak It’s not political no, it’s a decision to get children learning and back into schools.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think from the results so far (yes winning), I’ll take it does not represent true public opinion, but twitter opinion 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds like the usual Labour way of going about things. Thank god we got rid of Labour 10 years ago, otherwise we would not have had any ability to protect jobs and businesses today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you watch #Gogglebox? If yes, do you think it represents the true public opinion?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarethMyton Except the Government have extended furlough until the end of October. Go figure. Bunch of numskulls on #gogglebox if they can’t understand a simple statement. Gentle easing, as per the scientific evidence and expert advice. What exactly do they want?! Typical channel 4 trash.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimSimonH @BethRigby That’s wrong again. The R in Germany was around 0.7 when they eased, same as us. And we arnt easing as quickly. Do facts not matter to you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNewsBreak The Government has stated that they wouldn’t open them unless safe to do so, and we are still 2 weeks away. So many children are suffering with no school and being stuck in flats etc. Seems v political to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see the teaching unions are playing politics. Opening primary schools in June is needed and will be done in a safe way. It’s still 2 weeks’ away and more children will suffer if they can’t go back soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrKins85 We will indeed. Bare in mind though, the increase is largely due to carehome infection rates are their peak a couple of weeks ago. That has massively come down and so the R rate should come down. Easing of lockdown with social distancing should not increase it much, if at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimSimonH @BethRigby Wrong. The increase was because of massive spread in care homes, that has massively reduced but isn’t showing on the R yet. Easing of lockdown is with social distancing, so should not drive it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jen_vs_life @MrKins85 It’s will always fluctuate and the Government has said it will keep an eye on it as things are eased. If it does go up too much, easing the lockdown will pause. If people are responsible with the 2m rule, it shouldn’t rise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the R rate has gone back up people are saying. Remember that the same thing happened in Germany, and then went straight back down. Also, this slight increase is largely down to carehomes, no generally and goes back a couple of weeks. Let’s not scaremonger now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveKirby_HKR It went up because of what was happening in carehomes at the time. If people are responsible and keep our distance, no reason to think it’ll go up further. Germany went slightly up and then back down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liam_l96 It’s gone up slightly based on increase in carehomes. Get it right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrKins85 It’s not above 1. It’s between 0.7 and 1, let’s not scaremonger now. People do however need to be responsible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This👇🏼 You watch the @BBCNews try to scaremonger the country now. It’s normal to have slight fluctuations, and this rise is largely from carehomes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks @DavidGHFrost for the update. It does highlight exactly why the UK voted to leave. The EU &amp; Barnier constantly make unreasonable demands, and seem blind to the fact we are now becoming an independent nation. We will not be ruled by the European Union. The end. #Brexit 🇬🇧<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Labour lefties are a nasty bunch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>EU again playing games and trying to make unreasonable demands. If they continue like that, we will end the transition with no trade agreement and that will be the EU’s fault. The UK should stand firm and I am glad we have @BorisJohnson in charge. #Brexit #FridayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have a feeling the UK economy will rebound faster than most, due to the unprecedented steps the treasury &amp; @RishiSunak took to protect jobs &amp; businesses. Let’s hope the easing of the lockdown can happen over June &amp; July as planned. Up to us all to act responsibly. #FridayFeeling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glasterlaw1 That’s why I can’t watch #bbcqt anymore. Makes by blood boil seeing how biased it is. It’s the same every week, the Conservative MP barely gets a word in and is constantly interrupted, and yet the anti Government guests are allowed to talk constantly. BBC is a disgrace atm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree with this. That’s why there must be a balance, which is why the Government are right to start easing restrictions, but in a cautious way to ensure there is no second peak. It’s not just covid that can kill people. #StayAlert #bbcqt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A massive thank you to everyone in the NHS during this horrid pandemic. I would also like to say a big thank you to @BorisJohnson &amp; everyone working so hard in his team to help the country get through this. Strong leadership is needed &amp; he is definitely the man for the job #bbcqt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This 👇🏼 #London #KhanOut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was literally not mentioned at all. If it had been missed, be all over it. Makes me so bloody angry at the way the media are. If they’d been like this against the Government in the war, we’d have lost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What exactly does Labour Mayor @SadiqKhan actually do?! Couldn’t get a grip on knife crime, doesn’t stick to his promises on housing, can’t manage finances or TfL. #ResignKhan #LabourFail #London #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteCoat @JMPSimor @Keir_Starmer @BorisJohnson Side of Boris? The Government is borrowing hundreds of billions to help keep ppl in jobs, grants to help businesses, more than most countries in the world, yet you think he’s thinking of himself? Grow up. It’s only cos you hate him for delivering  Brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamCumminsx @NicolaSturgeon @BorisJohnson He did a national address on Sunday. He did a statement in the commons on Monday afternoon, he did a press conference on Monday night and since then has been working on coordinating the UK response. Scotland have a higher rate of infection and barely any testing being done...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you for all you and your team are doing. A PM that got Brexit done, now getting us through a pandemic like no other &amp; no doubt you will get us through an economic recession. Let’s all stick together, act responsibly and #SaveLives. #ThursdayMotivation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Labour mayor @SadiqKhan has now sunk to blackmail. He’s always been a useless mayor, inc through this pandemic, where he has cut tube services so low, key workers had to cram on tubes. Maybe if you hadn’t spent so much money on PR gimmicks, you’d have more. #ThursdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMPSimor @Keir_Starmer @BorisJohnson In your dreams. It really is the elite &amp; arrogant v the people. Boris is on the side of the people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg, the old @AldiUK advert is back. The old ones are the best! “I don’t like tea, I like gin”👌🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @GMB No, it’s because you don’t listen, you interrupt constantly and your a bully.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lord_Sugar Remember the 200,000 target is capacity, not tests done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is no clear plan going forwards from the Labour Government in Wales. They are very quick to have a go at @Conservatives, but have no plan themselves, no timescales, no goals, minimal testing and quite frankly awful communication. At least @BorisJohnson has a plan. #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A fair response by @BorisJohnson back to @Keir_Starmer. Labour really have decided to not bother working constructively anymore, but to attack the Government for the sake of it, in the hope to score some political points. Most of their attacks are inaccurate I might add. #PMQs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IainDale @Keir_Starmer Not sure why you ever liked her, she’s always been a nasty poisonous excuse for a human.

<|startoftext|>😂🤣 On my way!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really can’t stand @DawnButlerBrent and never have. She was always the nodding dog next to Corbyn at #PMQs.

<|startoftext|>I am never surprised at the lies Labour tell, but to try and take the credit for something that @RishiSunak &amp; a @Conservatives Government brought in, disgusts me.  It was never Labours idea, they were still going through the leadership election at the time. #FurloughScheme<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer The furlough scheme was brought in before Labour mentioned anything. Trying to take credit for it just shows how low Labour go. Disgusted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelpCareHomes @ProfKarolSikora Not really. Most European counties haven’t released their community deaths, and so it’s inaccurate. Not good with facts then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RMCunliffe @JoshSmithSpears Hence why the first schools children to go back are primary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In Wales - Unlimited exercise, garden centres, B&amp;Q, Homebase all open, now KFC &amp; Starbucks this week, yet the Labour Welsh Government still has the slogan ‘Stay at Home’.

<|startoftext|>@SoniaZanutto1 Boris has given clear instructions. You do realise that Sturgeon will eventually have to tell people to go back to work as well &amp; in different stages.

<|startoftext|>@DavidLammy You said that about Corbyn. You have no sense of reality.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This man nailed it 👇🏼I don’t see what more @BorisJohnson can do if people are determined to be confused. The #borisjohnsonspeech has been clear what you can and can’t do. It also mapped out stages for reopening &amp; dates (if the science allows). Why are people like Pooja confused?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s the majority of twitter stuffed then. Strange that most people can’t grasp simple instructions &amp; the fact its more complex coming out of lockdown. The scientists also have to keep measuring how the changes affect the infection rate, do forever changing. #borisjohnsonspeech<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do some on twitter (&amp; Pooja ) not realise that going into lockdown is not as easy coming out of it. Easy to say ‘close everything, stay at home’. A lot harder to lift restrictions bit by bit, across so many areas, whilst measuring the changes in infection. #borisjohnsonspeech<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LukePollard Sitting behind a desk doing a party political broadcast for a few mins? Boris is actually running the country, working constantly with advisors, experts and making massive decisions. Easy to have a go watching from the sidelines, another things actually doing the work of the PM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pabcoms There were precise instructions. What did you not get then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyhewertson Well obviously, it was longer than 15 minutes. He could hardly do that in a short statement to the nation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdwardJDavey @LibDems @BorisJohnson Scientists advise, they don’t make policy decisions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@b_judah @alexwickham Britain leading the slogans 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m worried for the nation, as it’s seems lockdown has killed off the ability for people to follow clear instructions and understand simple tasks. The nations brains have turned to push, or is it just twitter heads?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Generally puzzled as to how people can possibly be confused from that #borisjohnsonspeech. It was clear, informative, set out how we can go out more, but that we must adhere to social distancing &amp; set out clear goals &amp; a timeline to incentivise us-#thanksboris. Are you confused?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t understand how the likes of @Schofe &amp; @hollywills on @thismorning say they don’t understand the #borisjohnsonspeech. What don’t they get!? 🙄 Are they pretending to be stupid? You can go out more but have to abide by social distancing. Boris set clear goals &amp; a timeline.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickeardleybbc @BBCr4today Not at the same time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welsh Conservatives call for FM to publish lockdown exit plan - Labour haven’t increased testing in Wales like the Tories have in England, they haven’t released an exit plan and cases per 100,000 are the highest in Wales. #LabourFail   https://t.co/juYqh1nWsG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatyFBrand @BorisJohnson The only people confused are the ones who don’t want to listen to clear instructions and the ones who are part of the anti Tory Government brigade. Haters gunna hate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#thanksboris for treating us like adults &amp; explaining the need to keep going with social distancing, but also providing a rough timescale for opening shops, schools, bars &amp; restaurants. The majority of us understood, it’s a shame some people refuse to listen. #borisjohnsonspeech<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wales doing so great, NOT. It’s no surprise though when Labour are in charge and are not ramping up testing like the @Conservatives are in England. If they are going to tell people to ignore the #borisjohnsonspeech, then they need to have a plan of their own. They don’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EssexPR I’ll come and visit once this is all over mate. There are some pathetic people around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmmaKennedy The majority of people don’t use public transport. If you do but don’t need to, change your method of transport. Only use it if you have too. What’s hard about that? Is it your anti Tory agenda affecting your ability to think clearly?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely love this 👇🏼@Iromg absolutely nailing it once again.  The #borisjohnsonspeech absolutely made clear the rules on social distancing, the state we are in now and the route out of lockdown. It set clear goals, a timeline and an incentive for us to abide by the rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IF we all abide by the rules now and follow social distancing. The #borisjohnsonspeech set out clear instructions, clear goals and clear incentives. We must abide by the guidelines. Put simply, if we act responsibly, we are rewarded at the end. #thanksboris #MondayMotivation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s honestly ridiculous. The #borisjohnsonspeech was clear on social distancing &amp; set out a timeline. Some deliberately trying to confuse others, shows they don’t care for people’s health. It’s all about scoring political points &amp; pushing their anti Tory Gov agenda. Disgraceful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@domjoly Well then you must be one very stupid person. The #borisjohnsonspeech was as clear as day. It set out how we must abide by social distancing, how we can go out more to open spaces, and it set clear goals and a rough timetable to reopen things. What’s hard to understand? 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s honestly pathetic. I refuse to believe anybody is that stupid that they don’t understand, so must be pretending to be confused to score political points. Absolutely disgusting during a pandemic. #borisjohnsonspeech<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamCoatesSky @KayBurley @DominicRaab It’s a no as it can’t be policed. It’s open public spaces I believe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same goes for Wales.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@louisewestwood @imLucyWatson You were rude to start making out it’s easy to plan. It’s extremely difficult with things changing daily and the fact People’s behaviour can change the outcomes. So your tweet was both rude and stupid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xoxTylerHandxox @imLucyWatson I think if you can drive to a park or wherever now and you stick to social distancing, it’s quite clear you can meet family. Only if 2m apart though. That has been confirmed today. Social distancing must be adhered too though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cheshiretoad @alexwickham @KateAndrs You can.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see @RealMattLucas was desperate for a bit of attention last night. I guess some celebs are missing the limelight. Poor souls.  For the record, if you got confused over the #BorisSpeech, then you really are thick as mince. It was as clear as day. #lockdown #mondaythoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WoodyHRT So you didn’t watch it then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamFirstAlways @RealMattLucas Not clever then are you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElliotElinor @RealMattLucas Clearly didn’t watch it. What exactly don’t you understand? 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drdavidbull @10DowningStreet Everyone messaging you is either stupid or politically motivated then. It was clear as day. Informative, set out instructions, gave goals and milestones and an incentive to stick to the rules to get things opening again. It also reiterated social distancing. What’s confusing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hollieh0llie @jeremycorbyn 🤣🤣 So Corbyn wouldn’t listen to the expert medical and scientific advisors at all then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@De_Revo_lution Exact figure? Source please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@De_Revo_lution You keep dodging the question. What is our  death rate per million then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonLocke @LordAshcroft @BorisJohnson Has to be gradual, public won’t buy a sudden lifting and that would be dangerous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@De_Revo_lution What a load of bollocks. Grow up and stop spreading lies. What’s our death rate per million then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeiniolCarter 200k capacity won’t be reached by the end of the month? How? It’s already 150k, so only need a 50k increase and 3 weeks to do so. Seems strange that you don’t give a damn how little tests are being done in Wales. I assume you don’t vote Labour as they test so little<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeiniolCarter Covering what up? They said capacity when they announced 200k target. They tend to be doing around 96k atm, but then wales are doing around 1k 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@De_Revo_lution Slowest to react? Our NHS was never overwhelmed like other countries, so clearly not the slowest. We were not short on PPE, it’s never run out, though it is a constant issue has global shortage. We do not have the highest death rate per million at all. Complete lie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeiniolCarter The target is 200k capacity at the end of this month. It’s currently 150k capacity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @philgentco We all know the lefties and the most stupid are on twitter. Twitter is not real life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@De_Revo_lution He is the PM of the United Kingdom and he wants it to be for all 4 nations. It’s just a shame the devolved Governments think they know better than the experts advising the Government and have gone against it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeiniolCarter You can do both. That is what Boris is doing. I think England are in a much better position to control the virus as they have ramped up testing, but Wales haven’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan There’s nothing stopping you all going to the same park and social distancing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This 👇🏼 If you don’t think #BorisJohnson was clear, you are either politically motivated or stupid. It was clear as day, with a set of goals for easing the lockdown..... #BorisSpeech<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel sorry for all the pub &amp; restaurant owners in Wales. #BorisJohnson set out a plan to start reopening them in England from July (if we all follow the rules and get the infection rate down further), yet no plan in the Wales &amp; likely at least a month behind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #BorisJohnson speech tonight was very clear. The tone was correct, &amp; involved a mix of setting things out now and how things could be if we all follow the rules. The better we are now, the better things will be. A clear incentive from BoJo. #BorisSpeech #stayingalert  https://t.co/hQsB6CkJpt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@louisewestwood @imLucyWatson All this is the planning. Hence the dates he announces for June and July. It’s a situation that is constantly changing, it’s not like planning a party you complete idiot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xoxTylerHandxox @imLucyWatson The issue is, even things reopening will be with social distancing. So it’s very hard to say when you can see family without social distancing, esp if some of those family members are elderly or vulnerable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @GMB @DominicRaab You don’t listen to any answers, so no loss. Government can answer any questions at tomorrow’s press conference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@magiciandoz @AndrewRTDavies They will need to set things out. That is what Boris is doing. He isn’t saying the lockdown is over or not to social distance, he is setting out clear goals. If we stick at it now, things reopen in June and July. Currently the Gov are paying wages and the economy is crashing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mark Drakeford &amp; the Welsh Labour Government are completely useless. If you want to distance yourself from what Boris &amp; England are setting out, you at least need to have a plan yourself. He doesn’t.  #BorisJohnson set out clear instructions, timescales, goals and incentives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Scotland don’t have a clue. If they are going to go separate from Boris in England, they are going to need to do a lot better. They will have to ease restrictions at some point and get their nation back to work...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can’t wait to see how Wales and Scotland eventually try to get their nations out of lockdown in the future, and what their slogans are going to be. Easy to attack #BorisJohnson now, but they aren’t doing anything to set out milestones. Can’t put out ‘stay at home’ forever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need some new Rihanna music in this lockdown. Come on @rihanna!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamboultonSKY Let’s be serious, it doesn’t take much to get you confused. Surprised you make it out the house.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going to miss my weekly #DivaOnLockdown. Definitely provided some laughs. Well done @missgemcollins for providing some much needed relief during this awful time 💙<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SylviaMaryRyan3 It’s worrying isn’t it. I don’t see how he could be clearer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BoJo speech was clear to most people, but not all of the twitter bubble, the hardcore lefties, the remain rabble and some of the MSM. #BorisSpeech #HatersGunnaHate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love Boris too, @missgemcollins 💙 #DivaOnLockdown #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyHearn09 Yea, clear timescales of when things will open, IF we stick to the rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gabriel160519 Yup, clearly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully, this can explain to the people who didn’t quite understand simple English in the #BorisSpeech.  #BorisJohnson gave clear instructions, clear timescales, clear goals and clear incentives. If you want things to open, stick to the rules 👇🏼  https://t.co/5MFwLqw8n1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@susannareid100 You clearly need to go back to school then to learn how to listen. Shameful you’re in a prominent TV role of you can’t understand basic instructions. It was clear, with specific goals and incentives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some people want to be confused.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching @BorisJohnson speech and soon @missgemcollins on #DivaOnLockdown. Sunday sorted!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidJames901 @DrGABaines They can for delivery and pick up as it’s food. Some already open, like KFC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonnaWisdom10 Step 2, they come under shops I believe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SophieCorcoran0 Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think #BorisJohnson was great &amp; gave clear incentives to stick to the rules.  🏃🏼Unlimited exercise outside, inc sunbathing, playing sports, but must be with your household.  📚In June, schools &amp; shops start reopening.  🍔In July, restaurants/bars start reopening.  Thanks Boris<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyhewertson Not sure how it lacked clarity. Clear goals. Clear dates. Clear incentives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer Well you clearly can’t listen to clear instructions. Thank god you’re not the PM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 Disagree. Im happier now after it. It’s given a goal that we could have shops open in 3 weeks and pubs opening in July if we all stick to the rules now. How’s that depressing? Depressing would be no goals and no incentives. #BorisSpeech<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Ay? He gave clear timescales of when things can open if we all continue to abide by the rules. Did you watch anything?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@montie He’s given clear goals of reopening the economy, and actually quite soon if we all listen to the rules now. Shops could be open in 3-4 weeks. It’s goals with incentives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed, #BorisJohnson was very clear &amp; gave specific goals. Hopefully an incentive for people to abide by the rules now, with the aim to have things open in June and July.  If people don’t listen now, then BoJo won’t open shops and pubs on those times. #BorisSpeech<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who’s watching PM Boris at 19:00?#Lockdown #StayAlert #SaveLives #PeoplesPM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An excellent read on why the UK does NOT have the worst death rate or figures in Europe👇🏼 Many countries have not released the majority of their figures outside of hospitals. Let’s not spread misinformation. Let’s stick together. #StayAlert #SaveLives   https://t.co/Me90eblsLj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matt_dathan She shouldn’t be in the job then. It’s basic stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peston Not always possible on a bus, train etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I actually like the slogan. ‘Stay at Home’ couldn’t last much longer, it takes time to change behaviours. ‘Protect the NHS’ had to go as there is plenty of capacity &amp; some people that are ill aren’t going to hospital to ‘protect it’. Overall aim remains - #SaveLives. #StayAlert<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great news but makes you think why the hell the UK isn’t opening bars till late summer, which is months away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same! 🤗 ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And people wonder why the infection rate and death numbers aren’t going down quicker. The reason we are in lockdown much longer than planned, is because of selfish people. Fine them all 1k each and then put that money back into the NHS. #lockdownuk #Marr #SundayMorning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthea_bailey Nailed it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraceyM31699641 @MPSHackney But the young then mix with families etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lockdown won’t end until rate of infection is right down. It won’t happen if people don’t listen. 😡 Police fury as 'hundreds' of people have pizzas, beers and wine in park  https://t.co/L87BT94mMU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Walk down a few streets and see so many families mixing, so many teenage lads in groups mixing. How the fuck is the ‘R’ rate &amp; cases meant to go right down if people won’t listen. We will be in lockdown forever if these dickheads don’t stop disobeying the rules. So angry!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@campbellclaret @BorisJohnson Can you get any lower. People died in the war and we would never have won that war with people like you and the media constantly having a go at the PM and Government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lest we forget. So proud of the effort of everyone back in World War 2. We all owe them a great deal, not just the people on the frontline fighting, but all the people back at home and those involved in the strategic logistics of the war. 👏🏼 #VEDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The difference is, 75 years ago there wasn’t an incompetent media, foaming at the mouth for some sensationalism. If today’s media had been around 75 years ago, they would have been destroying public spirit, the Government and we would have lost the war. #bbcqt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lewis_goodall @BethRigby A robust question? 😂 Didn’t realise the media were switching to comedians now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @BethRigby You really are a joke more Piers. You’re making yourself look like a right numpty. Beth does not ask serious questions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Corbyn 2.0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@montie You means the media went OTT, and now trying to blame the Government 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willhewont He’s an odd man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan You aren’t meant to lie mislead and distort the facts though. Sort it out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan He was quite articulate with it, as was Raab. Boris will unveil a roadmap of the milestones to bring us out of lockdown on Sunday, and some minor measures will start on Monday. Until then, he must get more scientific data and we must carry on staying at home. Quite clear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peston @bbclaurak 😅😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PippaCrerar @bbclaurak We all know that social distancing will be key and it won’t be ending any time soon. It’s not a message to the PM at all. Even an easing of the lockdown doesn’t mean no more social distancing. Do keep up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allisonpearson @Samgilding Well that’s what the scientific evidence suggests clearly. You a new scientist and data modeller now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robcmorgan @mcmann_ryan @craigbowler4 @MikeAubury 80k tests on 30th April (stripping out sent out test kits) doesn’t include any home test kits processed that day. That’s fact. They would have been counted on the day they were sent out. Therefore, you can’t say 100k tests weren’t done on 30th.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chasmanu @SamCoatesSky They do. They just don’t have it to hand today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can’t believe how dense @BethRigby is. Thick as mince!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robcmorgan @mcmann_ryan @craigbowler4 @MikeAubury They don’t just vanish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robcmorgan @mcmann_ryan @craigbowler4 @MikeAubury Therefore, 100k target was still met that way. The 80k figure includes no home test kits sent out or back in, so inaccurate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robcmorgan @mcmann_ryan @craigbowler4 @MikeAubury I don’t think you’re getting this. They count home test kits when they are sent out. 40k were sent out 30 April. If you don’t believe you should count test kits sent out, then you’d count them when sent back in instead. There would have been at least 20k sent back in on 30 April.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robcmorgan @mcmann_ryan @craigbowler4 @MikeAubury It’s not tho issit, because that 80k didn’t include any completed home tests kits. You can’t just take out the sent out home test kits from the figure, and then not put the completed ones in. Either way you count it, they passed 100k<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vince07683003 @EndHowards @BBCNews @NadiaWhittomeMP There’d be no party left then though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amurray1876 @SamCoatesSky Health first? Is that why they have the worst health service in the UK then? Is that why the Welsh Government are only doing around 1,000 tests a day 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DSmithSD @SamCoatesSky Wales is testing around 1,000 people a day for a population of 3m. Not great stats. Everything is worse in Wales. I’d trust Boris over Labour in Wales any day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamCoatesSky The Welsh Fist Minister? Sound about right 😂 👊🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NadiaWhittomeMP You were sacked because you lie. Disgraceful. We don’t need carers like you, who do more damage by scaring residents with lies, just to achieve some political point scoring.  https://t.co/bjHc9lrUZE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see that @BBCNews are still trying to spin this story as she was ‘sacked’ because she spoke out. She said she was scared for her safety because of a lack of PPE, yet they have plenty where she was working👇🏼 @NadiaWhittomeMP is a liar. The end. #LabourLie #COVID19 #thursdayvibes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCPolitics @BBCNewsnight She lied. Why miss that part out @BBCNews?  https://t.co/fJBUpPuTX7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkADavison @SteveBakerHW Btw, Boris never said we should take it on the chin. He said some people say that. Twist the facts as much as you like, but it doesn’t change them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkADavison @SteveBakerHW As in best case scenario 20,000. It was said it would likely be 20k-50k if lockdown measures were put into place. Devastating nonetheless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are @BBCNews @bbclaurak going to report on this? Or do they think it’s fine for Labour MPs to lie and causes vulnerable and elderly residents in a care-home distress?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NadineDorries Exactly. She was sacked for lying and causing residents distress, as well as damaging the reputation of the care-home.  https://t.co/mnGdcKhcVZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lowkey0nline She lied.  https://t.co/jptUzlsAcA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TommyCorbyn She lied.  https://t.co/hEZhZ59EfP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawnHFoster @NadiaWhittomeMP Do facts not matter to you? She lied.  https://t.co/BiXCJaZtMD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TracyBrabin She lied.  https://t.co/wwGtFFoXn4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kevin_Maguire She lied.  https://t.co/NvzrnSsbZk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidLammy She lied. That’s a sackable offence.  https://t.co/CK9kYwDkEm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Labour MP @NadiaWhittomeMP has been caught lying about a lack of PPE in a care-home, and in the process has scared residents. I know that Labour are only interested in trying to score political points &amp; don’t care about facts, but scaring the vulnerable &amp; elderly is wrong.  https://t.co/PgcwHsMIoz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanonImages15 @Keir_Starmer It’s Labour, I’m not shocked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer  https://t.co/DRauC17iYN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnnyMercerUK @David_Cameron Great to have you as an MP now @JohnnyMercerUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She was sacked for lying, as many Labour activists do regarding PPE to try and damage the Government. The Government is working tirelessly to get enough PPE out and this type of thing is a massive distraction. #LabourLie #FakeNews #FactsMatter #lockdownextension  https://t.co/OVS6WJw0wO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage . @RobertJenrick did not breach lockdown. He delivered items and medication to his elderly parents home, and did not go in. Grow up Nigel. I know you arn’t getting as much attention atm, but let’s not forget the facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickCohen4 @JuliaHB1 It was TWO actually 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Each death is tragic and extremely sad for the family and friends, but I think the media have a duty to report the actual facts. Yea we’ve passed 30k, which is heartbreaking, but we are not the first to do so if other countries haven’t released figures from all settings like us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Na Na this headline is so false. The UK maybe the first to officially ‘declare’ 30k deaths, but it certainly isn’t the first to pass 30k. Italy/Spain haven’t released all their care-home &amp; community deaths. Italy is likely to be around 40k deaths ffs.   https://t.co/dJYEsdfpUb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiamGilhooly @TonyM70 @JimKing34049311 @d_spiegel I haven’t mentioned France, never did, as I’m not sure what they release, but I don’t believe they release all community deaths. I mentioned Italy and Spain, as they definitely do not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TonyM70 @LiamGilhooly @JimKing34049311 @d_spiegel Excess deaths will tell the proper picture and I guarantee we will be nowhere near the worst. Whatever the figure, it’s extremely sad and tragic for each family<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimKing34049311 @TonyM70 @d_spiegel It’s widely accepted. The fact that the test of Europe haven’t released all of their figures says it all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbclaurak I’d like to learn why the likes of Italy and Spain arn’t officially releasing their true figures for deaths. They need to release their full carehome and community deaths urgently. That way, deaths can be compared more like for like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@d_spiegel I’d like to learn why the likes of Italy and Spain arn’t officially realising their true figures for deaths. They need to release their full carehome and community deaths urgently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@d_spiegel If you don’t want your article used, don’t bother writing it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blunted_james @afneil They were like for like originally. Hospital deaths. Then the media kept pushing on carehome deaths, so they started showing those, but obviously other countries are not releasing those figures, therefore it’s now not like for like<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afneil If care-home/community deaths make up around 1/3 of total deaths on average, the likes of Spain and Italy are under reporting by something like 10,000 deaths each. That’s astounding. Yet most of the media don’t report this and keep putting out the same false headlines<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craigbowler4 @robcmorgan @mcmann_ryan @MikeAubury And that will drive up demand for tests, which means the capacity will be reached more regular<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Newsbehindthen2 @BBCNews They have not. That’s bullshit. Even the stats agency in Italy has stated that death figures are majorly under reported there atm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First country to ‘report’ over 30k, but not the first to pass 30k. BIG difference. We have the fastest &amp; most accurate stats.  Many European countries reached this awful figure of 30k a while ago, but haven’t released up to date figures of deaths in ALL settings. #FakeNews #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCNews Except many countries in Europe have already passed that figure, but haven’t released up to date figures he, including ALL setting deaths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🔥 Hit the nail on the head there @JuliaHB1. Far too many ‘journalists’ are far more interested in pushing out their own agenda and anti Government rhetoric than actually delving into the actual facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrahamSanter @UKLabour He said some people say that, in an interview he had. How was that him saying it was policy?! You’re either thick as mud, or plain deceitful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear god. Why is Corbyn still trying to push out this big fat lie to the British people?! 🙄🙈🤣  People didn’t fall for that bull in December, and they certainly won’t fall for it now. At least we don’t have to hear your drivel at #PMQs. Silver lining n all that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RMCunliffe Just you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrahamSanter @UKLabour I suggest you go back and listen to what the PM said. It was never policy regarding herd immunity, only that it would happen when enough people had it and recovered. The scientific advice was followed, which means they would have ignored it if lockdown had been sooner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IainDale Neither do Italy. Hospitals overwhelmed but less deaths than us, I don’t think so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tnewtondunn This still doesn’t take into account the fact that the likes of Italy and Spain haven’t released all of their death figures from carehomes and community.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lewis_goodall Capacity is there....demand is. It’s a good sign if less people have symptoms and need a test. Let’s not be positive tho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People will start moaning about the ‘fourth day’ in a row that testing has been below 100k, however, you can’t make people get tested. Capacity is there and that is the most important thing. It’s a good sign if there are less people with symptoms needing a test....#DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. Demand lower than capacity.  Testing there for people to book if they want though....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Telegraph You mean the lockdown that the whole world did? 🙈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It really has. UK media are giving your media a run for their money. More fake news than actual real news at the moment... Apparently we have 7 x more deaths than China (🤔) and more than any country in Europe (even tho they haven’t even released their full figures yet...🙈🙄)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UKLabour Oh that ‘Guardian’ source, the left wing rag that rarely ever tells the truth. The Government has worked tirelessly to enforce lockdown, ramp up testing, deliver PPE, flatten curve &amp; expand NHS capacity. Some deaths are unavoidable in a pandemic, but it’s doing all it can.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peterkyle @BorisJohnson_MP @Keir_Starmer It isn’t, it just fits your narrative. Most countries are not reporting true accurate death figures. This includes the likes of Italy and Spain who have not included all carehome and community deaths. If the figures aren’t accurate, you arnt accurate in that accusation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RockboltG Like we all believe China has had less than 10k deaths<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s factually correct. They are smaller populations &amp; they have not released all of their death figures in all settings, such as community and carehome deaths. It’s therefore inaccurate to claim that the UK has the highest deaths in Europe. Only a pretty shoddy journalist would.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeaksLfc @ProfKarolSikora It will be a very slow easing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfKarolSikora As Boris said, they want to see more data first. I do find it odd the different approach by @NicolaSturgeon in saying another 3 weeks of lockdown for Scotland.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JGBS @bbclaurak Not everything is devolved though, so find it hard to understand how Scotland can make a decision regarding total lockdown for another 3 weeks by itself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfKarolSikora It’s on Sunday. You know this 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A major announcement, such as the magnitude of a country wide lockdown or easing of a lockdown needs to be made in an address directly to the nation first. The Government and @BorisJohnson are correct on this.  #WhereIsBoris? Planning for this next stage 👊🏼 This is utter tosh 👇🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tnewtondunn @resfoundation Might give them a feel of how normal life would be under Labour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peckham65till @LukeTrewin4 @piersmorgan Farage will do anything for the attention<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afneil Well I do hope you continue to remind others off this Andrew, including others in the media. The media have a duty to be accurate in its reporting &amp; they are failing currently. You must be one of the few in the media that haven’t claimed we have the highest figures in Europe!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afneil @slay4ever007 But it’s not the truth is it. The likes of Spain and Italy do not count all settings like we do and so their figures are inaccurate and not like for like with ours. You can’t possible say we have the highest death figures in Europe without all the figures from those countries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great stuff. Excellent work by @RishiSunak and the @Conservatives Government. Keeping people in jobs and more financially secure, during this pandemic, is key.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@legallyginge I realise this is all we have, and every death is tragic. The Government is doing all it can, including more tests, the app and lockdown. It’s pointless trying to say we are the worst in Europe, when it’s clear that without accurate figures from Italy etc, that’s not true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorjeFc @kcpearce42 I don’t dispute these figures, but the issue is that the likes of Italy are not including all carehomes/community deaths in their figures, yet we are. Therefore, it’s not accurate and not like for like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Coronavirus: Can you compare the UK with Italy? The answer is NO. Italy do not have accurate data on all deaths, have a lower population, have less density &amp; do not event count all care home/community deaths as we do. This is also the case for Spain etc.  https://t.co/g42pL17ocB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To all those stating we have the highest death rate in Europe. We don’t, as it’s not accurate.  The UK death figures includes all deaths, in all settings. Other European countries do not, including Italy and Spain. Therefore, the figures are not like for like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chrisevs16 Well, you’d be wrong then wouldn’t you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@legallyginge You can’t say we’ve passed every other European country when their figures do not include all of the deaths in care homes, community etc and ours do. They are not accurate and not like for like. They’ve made that clear int he news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachellh Plans have to be worked up in advance. You’d know that if you had a brain cell. On the highest death toll in Europe, on the released figures yes, but Italy, Spain etc haven’t released all their death figures for care homes, community etc, so it’s inaccurate &amp; not like for like<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kcpearce42 Hope you have more success at learning facts. Britain does not have the worst death rate in Europe. Death rate is based on population, which puts us behind Italy. Officially on figures we are ahead of Italy, but Italy haven’t released their deaths in all care homes, community etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hear the lefties on twitter asking.. #WhereIsBoris. Simple answer, he’s doing his job! He is coordinating the whole of Government behind the scenes, he is working with all his experts (including scientists) and is planning the next stage for easing up the lockdown. Cretins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Find it concerning the likes of Italy &amp; Spain aren’t releasing accurate death figures. We all know that Italy’s health system was overwhelmed, yet many deaths weren’t being counted. The death figures in those countries are clearly higher than the UK &amp; the official figures<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daandydan @saintjimjim @SkyNewsBreak NHS capacity was increased, the NHS was not overwhelmed, ventilators never ran out, testing capacity increased to over 100k and the peak has been flattened. I think Gov has done fairly well considering what people were saying initially. Obvs every death is awful tho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshSlater_ @saintjimjim @SkyNewsBreak They said they would get to 100k tests a day by the end of April. They did. They’ve dipped below that over the weekend, but will likely pick up again now. It also depends on people turning up for the tests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daandydan @saintjimjim @SkyNewsBreak No, I’m stating that in a world of misinformation, we should make sure we are accurate in reporting and not spread mistruths.  All deaths are awful yes, but deaths are to be expected during a global pandemic. The Government can only ever look to follow the science and experts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshSlater_ @saintjimjim @SamuelM35427190 @SkyNewsBreak Not at all. But in this case, we can’t say we have the most deaths in Europe when the true figures have not been reported in other European countries yet. It will change, and we are nowhere near the levels of Italy and Spain. Spain also has 20m people less.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshSlater_ @saintjimjim @SamuelM35427190 @SkyNewsBreak Italy have already stated that the true death figures are much higher than reported so far. Germany count deaths differently, and France have not included community deaths, only care home and hospital ones. They are NOT like for like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. You can’t compare UK death figures in ALL settings with other countries who haven’t released half of their figures from care-homes, community etc. It’s not like for like. So we clearly do not have the highest death rate in Europe by a long shot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@saintjimjim @SamuelM35427190 @AshSlater_ @SkyNewsBreak And they also stated that you can’t compare like for like. The UK states all settings, that’s not true for the others. If they suddenly released all of their true figures, then this would change. Get your head out the sand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am sick of the media &amp; some people trying to claim we have the worst death rate in Europe. All deaths are tragic, but we don’t have the worst. If other countries haven’t released half of their true death figures officially, then why are we trying to compare. It’s ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshSlater_ @saintjimjim @SkyNewsBreak They don’t at all. Plus, they don’t count the reason for the death the same as us, nor do they all have the same population as us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dannymards @SkyNewsBreak Actually no. On the figures released maybe, but the issue is most European counties are not releasing all of their carehome/community deaths in their figures. They also don’t count deaths the same, so are counting some as the underlying medical issue rather than covid like us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stickyyetsweet @SkyNewsBreak Tuesday and Wednesday are catching up with the weekend, so are generally a lot higher than previous days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@saintjimjim @SkyNewsBreak Except you aren’t comparing like for like. Our deaths include ALL settings, many countries don’t, and we record deaths a different way to many other countries. Therefore the deaths reported in other countries are not accurate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNewsBreak This is very low for a Tuesday. Obviously every death is tragic, but we have to look at the positives that deaths are really starting to fall now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LarissaMVLopez @alexwickham They don’t want to confuse the message now, but it wasn’t quite perfected at that stage was it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow!! So we have countries trying to attack our labs fighting to find vaccines. This needs urgent action.  Coronavirus: Rival states targeted UK and US coronavirus labs with 'malicious cyber campaigns'  https://t.co/J9chWjpH3k  https://t.co/UjH2AGwI0y<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexwickham If your hands are washed before it and after, it won’t make a difference. Pipe down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Easy to say we are the worst in Europe when you don’t have accurate figures from other European countries. Most are NOT reporting deaths from all settings, some don’t count covid if there is an underlying medical issue, and the likes of Italy have excess deaths unexplained 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t you just love the devolved administrations. Both trying to score political points, rather than work constructively together. Acting like children.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomCrittenden @david_de0107 @BBCHughPym We are testing more than a lot of other countries now. The likes of Germany has a much bigger diagnostics industry and so could deploy mass testing much quicker. Can’t compare easily.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@david_de0107 @BBCHughPym What a load of rubbish. They had to increase testing from a very low base with no infrastructure in place for mass testing. There was no magic wand to wave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shocking, but not surprising.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamboultonSKY The UK needs proper journalists, not ones more interested in headlines and grabbing attention. Report on the facts, not biased opinions, often based on mistruths and inaccurate information.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PippaCrerar You can’t compare when most European countries are not counting deaths in all settings and some count the death as the underlying health problem, not covid 19. It’s not comparible in the slightest. Only excess deaths will paint the true picture, and we don’t have that yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexHeffron88 @BBCPolitics It was 100k tests carried out. If you don’t want to include the figures of the tests sent out on that Thursday 30th (not completed), you’d have to count the ones sent back in as completed on the Thursday (sent out days earlier), so either way, they passed 100k.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amber_Davies7 Same. Looking over holidays....miss them so much 😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good on @michaelgove. About time this shameful woman was put down a few pegs. Never has she ever thought about the British people, if she had, she’d have respected the fact Britain voted to leave. #LibDemLoser #mondaythoughts #MayThe4th<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You’re definitely negative @piersmorgan, in more ways than one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤯 Nobody can say that the @Conservatives arn’t helping working people through this. Huge financial cost, but the right decision to protect jobs. Let’s hope lockdown can ease soon. #COVIDー19 #DailyBriefinguk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a feeling in a couple of weeks, we are going to be constantly told to ‘stay home, download the app, protect the NHS, save lives’. Just a feeling......#DailyBriefinguk #COVIDー19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trevgreen28 @PHE_uk Home test kits become available generally around 7pm. Try then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How ironic that the BBC tweet this, when they are one of the worst for spreading #fakenews &amp; misinformation, including things like #Panorama whereby everyone interviewed is Labour affiliated.

<|startoftext|>@mrjamesob @MirandaShirnia They hit the 100k target 2 days in a row. Some people don’t like the fact they counted set sent out tests, but if they didn’t, they would have counted sent back in tests. Either way, they hit the target. Today was less yes (Saturday figures), but it’s the weekend effect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goobervision @MattHancock @ThatTimWalker You do realise that if you don’t count ones you send out, then you’d have to count the ones sent back in. So either way, he hit the target. You just don’t want thousands of home test kits to disappear into thin air. You’re deceitful, so assuming anti Tory?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardBurgon Fake news<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkStanding3 @FreddieScovell @afneil @MattHancock The official target was to reach 100k tests in a day by the end of April. That was achieved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now that the peak has passed, the Government this week will set out plans to gently start opening up the economy &amp; easing lockdown. It’s always been about the right steps, at the right time. That will continue, based into the scientific and medical advice. #LOCKDOWN2020 #Marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m ready.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@buffoonsrus @afneil No date. Next.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bit rich coming from such a cheat....guess you have more in common with Labour than ever....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SayNoToLabour10 What’s he done now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alantwill @DeborahMeaden Germany doesn’t even count deaths as covid if they have underlying health issues, therefore, their death rate isn’t accurate. We have a higher pop than some countries. Regardless, you’d hate the Tories no matter what they do. They’ve supported more ppl financially than most too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thankyajohn @greg_herriett @afneil @matthew1noonan Yes, and on Thursday, many postal tests would have been processed in the lab but weren’t counted, as they had been counted when sent out in previous days. My point is, if people want to take out the figures of sent out, then they have to put in the figures for completed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Inaccurate actually. As it was always tests per day, not people. But hey ho, you have a narrative to push. But what exactly are they winning btw? They are working tirelessly to defeat a glastly virus. No time for talks of winning or losing🙄 we can only ever work hard!  https://t.co/pu1Jch7tnY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elllaaa8 @Wright_LN You are not listening to the facts or understanding simple maths, so I can only put it down to that.  The Government are doing a great job. All lives lost are awful but in a pandemic lives will be lost and the governments task (with advisors and experts) is to lower lives lost<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robcmorgan @craigbowler4 @mcmann_ryan @MikeAubury The 80k doesn’t include home test kits completed on the Thursday though, so inaccurate. You can’t just take out sent out figures, and then not put completed figures. You’re just ignoring home testing completely 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craigbowler4 @robcmorgan @mcmann_ryan @MikeAubury Some people don’t want to believe the facts because it’s a Tory Government in power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elllaaa8 @Wright_LN You have to do it within 24hrs as a courier is booked. If you don’t want to include Thursdays sent out figures, you’d need to include Wednesdays sent out figures. That on top of face to face tests would be over 100k. You are not getting this because you like Corbyn dislike tories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robcmorgan @craigbowler4 @mcmann_ryan @MikeAubury If you don’t want to include Thursdays sent out, then you’ll need to include Wednesdays sent out (as they would have been done on Thursday). Either way, 100k target was met. If you can’t understand simple maths, then you’re either not with it, or anti Tory.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elllaaa8 @Wright_LN 81k tests done via face to face test centres.  At least 19k tests from home testing (sent out Tues/Wed) would have been returned on the Thursday COMPLETED. So how is that not 100k. You don’t want the tests sent out on thurs included, but won’t include Wednesdays 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elllaaa8 @Wright_LN At the same time they sent out 40k tests on the Thursday, they would have received back roughly the same amount from the day before. Therefore, the 100k target was still met. 80k tests at centres, plus Wednesdays completed home tests would be over 100k<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elllaaa8 @Wright_LN Ok, say I agree with you, they’d still have met the target as all the ones sent out on the Wednesday would be counted on the Thursday as that is when they would have been completed. You could send 40k out each day, they all come back in the the next day. So you end up the same<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonKelleyUK @j5jayou @TrueUser2020 @ingwe61 @lewis_goodall Yes but home tests are never counted again at the lab, only once when sent out. So if you don’t want to use the figure of tests sent out, you’d have to include the ones from the day before being sent back in to the lab, but these are not being counted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elllaaa8 @Wright_LN But they only count home test kits once, when sent out. So if you don’t count them then, you’d have to count them when returned. That means, if you don’t use the sent out figure on Thursday, you’d have to use Wednesdays sent out figure as they’d be arriving back. Still over 100k<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elllaaa8 @Wright_LN For example, home tests kits sent out on Tues and Wed would have been partly processed and completed on the Thursday.  But they won’t be included in figures for Thursday because they were counted when sent out. You can’t just take out Thursday sent out figure &amp; not include wed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elllaaa8 @Wright_LN False. Because in that 82k figure you mention, that’s doesn’t include ANY home tests completed. The Government only counts them once, when sent out. If you don’t use that figure, you’d have to use the figure when they are sent back in. But you are not including that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeborahMeaden @alantwill We don’t have the second highest death rate. Many countries do not include all settings, such as carehomes. Germany also count deaths in a diff way &amp; registers the death as the underlying medical issue, not covid. You’re false reporting. Surely not because you hate the Tories?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only people trying to compare apples with metal bars are the idiotic lefties and some parts of the media looking for a bit of sensationalism. They don’t like the facts, they don’t like the Government, hence they will do anything but tell the truth. #COVID__19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quite worrying how many people on Twitter can’t count, yet are so vocal and adamant on the fact their numbers are correct, when they ain’t. Such a cesspit of lefties and idiots on twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elllaaa8 @Wright_LN They didn’t count the completed home test kits from the Wednesday, because they count home tests when they go out. If you don’t want to use the figures from Thursday being sent out, you’d have to use the one coming back in from Wednesday. Either way, they met 100k target<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wright_LN The 81k figure doesn’t include the home test kits sent out on the Wednesday and then completed on the Thursday. If you don’t want to count the tests being sent out on the Thursday, you’d have to count the ones sent back in from Wednesday. Either way, they met the 100k<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fjd_artist If you don’t count the ones mailed that day on Thursday, you’d have to count the ones sent back from Wednesday. Either way, the Gov met the target. I know this is awful news to you, but it’s fact. The home test kits have to be counted at some point, they don’t disappear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greg_herriett @afneil @matthew1noonan Home tests aren’t counted at the lab. They are counted when sent out. So basically you just don’t want any home tests counted. You either count Thursdays dispatched, or Wednesdays sent back in. Either way, it’s over 100k tests in total with normal lab ones too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greg_herriett @Nickolarge @afneil @matthew1noonan All tests are only counted once. Home tests are counted once only, when sent out. If you don’t want to use that figure from the ones being sent out on Thursday, then you’d have to use Wednesdays figure as they would have been completed on Thursday. Either way, it’s over 100k.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yorkie_49 @Kevin_Maguire What about the home tests sent out on Wednesday that were completed on Thursday, you’ve not added those in. You can’t just take out posted tests, and not include the completed ones then from the day before. You’re the liar here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chasmanu @Kevin_Maguire If you’re going to use the figure of 81k completed tests, then you’d have to then include the home test kits sent out on Wednesday that were completed on Thursday on top. So it’s over 100k.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kevin_Maguire @alantwill But if you don’t count the ones sent out, you’d have to count the home test kits sent back in from the day before. Either way, the 100k target was met. I know that doesn’t fit your anti Tory narrative, but they are the facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillNeelyNBC Yes but if you don’t count the test sent out that day, you’d have to count the ones sent back in from the day before. So either way, you meet the target. You quoted that only 81k were conducted, but that doesn’t count any from Wednesday that were sent out and done on Thurs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@j5jayou @TrueUser2020 @JasonKelleyUK @ingwe61 @lewis_goodall But if you didn’t count tests dispatched, you’d have to count the ones sent back in from the day before. So either way, they beat the target. Does that not fit your narrative?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrueUser2020 @MattHancock @BBCRadio4 Where did he lie?  https://t.co/LLGNXvgfp6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whichever way you count the home tests, whether you count them when the go out (as is the case here) or when they come back in from the day before, they still beat the target of 100k a day. No test is counted twice. @MattHancock and his team beat their target of 100 tests a day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robcmorgan @craigbowler4 @MikeAubury If you don’t count the ones sent out in Thursday, you’d have to count the completed ones sent back in from Wednesday. Either way then, the target was met. People really don’t like the fact it was met.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robcmorgan @MikeAubury But what about the 20k tests sent back in from Wednesday that weren’t counted in Thursdays figures? If you’re gunna discount ones being sent out Thursday, you’d should include Wednesdays that were sent back in on Thursday. Either way then, they met the target you fool<|endoftext|>
