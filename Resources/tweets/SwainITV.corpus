<|startoftext|>Hear hear - @ranvir01 so deserved to be in the final.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On 🔥I have the easy job watching @ranvir01 with a fire pit and glass of wine! #strictly #ranvir  https://t.co/mY38nyDMZp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeanFletcherTV @SpursOfficial And up early today too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only one place to be this morning to celebrate the life of #BarbaraWindsor #Eastenders set at Elstree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PosseRecovery @DrHilaryJones Thanks for sharing Nikki. It’s sounds like you’ve had a horrendous ordeal with Covid. You know better than anyone why the vaccine is so important. I hope the recovery is going well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree with @DrHilaryJones This result is tragic. Almost half of people saying no to the vaccine. It’s the most heavily regulated industry in the world and it could save your life and end this horrible pandemic if you have it. #vaccination<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davebarr73 @GMB @BBCCWR Yeah - I was terrified! Hope all is good with you mate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicolaBeddoes @susannareid100 @GMB @BBCCWR On its way 🫖<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Roz4luv @GMB @BBCCWR Of course! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After the excitement and emotion of the #vaccine launch hospitals step up the number of vaccines today - away from the cameras.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@errongordon @GMB @BBCCWR Thanks mate  - a great day for the U.K!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@errongordon What a lovely chap! I love the what’s all the fuss about attitude.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great to hear @GMB vaccine coverage being mentioned on @BBCCWR where I used to work (as a 16 year old tea-boy!) 🫖<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A momentous day-a real pleasure talking to nurse May Parsons on @lorraine @reallorraine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to hug her on behalf of everyone....May Parsons who told me how proud she is of the staff at Coventry Hospital - as she was the first nurse to administer the #vaccine  https://t.co/6fgKzMSWZE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The nurse of the moment. 👇#vaccine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Worth being sent to Coventry! As a local lad - tremendous news that the first vaccine happened here on grandmother Margaret Keenan.  @piersmorgan @susannareid100 #vaccine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s upon us! The very first patient to receive the vaccine is happening any minute now. #vaccine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkRichards18 👍😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FionaAdrian Bless you! So pleased I drove tonight and not at silly o clock in the morning. Fog, rain, snow showers...wrap up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColleenLHarris Thanks! Hopefully some different but more positive news tomorrow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MRSCH1971 I know it well! Sky Blues supporter!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FionaAdrian On Christmas Eve - it’s got to be ‘Driving Home for Christmas’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I’ve just driven through snow showers. Surely time for Christmas tunes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m being sent to Coventry! See you in the morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Breathtaking finish to the match and #AutumnNationsCup Well played France. It could have gone either way. Enjoy your night @EnglandRugby  - watch out for @JoeMarler ! #ENGvFRA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree with @stephenjones9 piece last week and today - I hope we see less ping-pong kicking and more flair and attack from @EnglandRugby #ENGvFRA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great series of @imacelebrity Just what we all needed! Great work @ITV in tough times. Congrats to a humble and throughly lovely winner @MrsGiFletcher. @jordannorth1 seems a top bloke and I’m sure we’ll be seeing more of him .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lill_1971 Easy fella!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Credit to a very measured Jonathan Van Tam explaining on @bbc5live how he and other scientists organised themselves very quickly to prepare for a vaccine roll out. We should be thankful we have approved this - as other countries will soon follow. @rachelburden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And still #trump is trying to hang on tweeting a ‘Fox News Investigation’ claiming fraud. It’s a cringey watch between anchor and reporter, as it’s all opinion and not fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An unlikely combination - Health Secretary @MattHancock has agreed to take the #Pfizer vaccine with @piersmorgan live on @GMB  to encourage others to take it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BREAKING #Pfizer #Pfizervaccine 👇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tremendous news - a shot in the arm for society, livelihoods and the health of our most vulnerable. @piersmorgan @susannareid100<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BREAKING Wow! It’s really happened! The U.K. has approved the use of the #Pfizervaccine It could be ready for use next week for #NHS staff, care home workers and residents and the over 80s @piersmorgan @susannareid100<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A big step forward as reports suggest the #Pzfizer #vaccine could be approved for use in U.K. by the weekend and rolled out next week to NHS staff, care home staff and residents and the over 80s. More on @GMB with @ranvir01<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benshephard Done my friend!  Never a fan of homework but that was ok for me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The new physical border for customs checks once we leave the EU is still...erm...a field. We are just 5 weeks away and the new customs lorry park is still being built. @GMB @piersmorgan @susannareid100  https://t.co/75cU7aHEJi<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BrendaI58824950 @GMB Thank you! Also keeps you warm too! 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our Dr Hilary @DrHilaryJones making headlines for the right reasons - as he attempts to keep the nation safe by not getting carried away with the relaxation rules at Christmas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lauratobin1 Exactly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Roz4luv @GMB 😂I’ve dusted myself off!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chris_greany @GMB Yes sah!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s not a thing but I’m harking back to #waistcoatwednesday An old relic from the World Cup in Russia.  The waistcoat that is! @GMB  https://t.co/vLmeAkdhGT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great explanation about the risks of getting together with family at Christmas @davidshukmanbbc explains the science and will surely make people think again before mixing with older relatives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So it looks like the government and home nations will announce that 3 households can socialise at Christmas for 5 days. But as many doctors like @DrHilaryJones make clear it doesn’t mean it’s the responsible thing to do. #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Loving the gastropods at this pub in Hampshire. Like so many in the hospitality trade owner Caroline  has lost so much income during the pandemic-but they are being creative to create a safer pub. @TheGeorgeFB  https://t.co/uOpP8roJkl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice to be back in a pub - even if it is 6am! @TheGeorgeFB has very smart gastropods. @GMB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kirstyodriscoll @tomparkerbowles @danwootton Pubs hit again but evidence shows the biggest risk of infection is supermarkets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think @10DowningStreet need to get on the phone and upgrade their broadband package...or has #Boris hit the mute button.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The details of the new tier system to possibly last until spring. 👇 Still a long road ahead and tough restrictions on many particularly the hospitality sector.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So a relaxation of the rules  from Dec 2nd shops, gyms and hairdressers can reopen and good news for sports fans as some fans up to 2,000 will be allowed back in some stadia. #lockdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ktsheaf3007851 Maybe ski jacket tomorrow 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrJJBowie Easy! But I’ll take it. Irony or not!😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bb_niabevan ....but every little helps!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think our biggest hope of overcoming #COVID19 will still come from the British vaccine. Oxford trials shows a strong immune response in adults in their 60s &amp; 70s. The Government could acquire large quantities for mass immunisations.Big breakthrough. @benshephard @susannareid100<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imogen_swain Oh yes it is.....😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think this should be my look for all of December! Ho ho ho!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>After a bit of a boost last week on vaccine news. Now the  reality of the struggling travel industry - as #EasyJet reveals a loss of £1.27bn so far this year. This is a desperate plunge after a £430m profit last year.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ktsheaf3007851 @ranvir01 Oh yes - any excuse !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So will it finally happen?! @MattHancock should be on @gmb shortly after no government minister appearing on the programme for 201 days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boris Johnson appears full of beans this morning. A busy week but he is now confined to barracks. @GMB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well done @ranvir01 I’m sure you’re not missing this place - only you bring a little sparkle to a cold morning in Downing Street!  https://t.co/l7dvl3CIAm<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The latest episode of the new Downing Street drama....#Boris  #CarrieSymonds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlanChand Bless you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Appropriate to be working near the cenotaph today and I noticed that as well the wreaths by royalty &amp; government - perhaps more moving a few flowers left with messages to Dads &amp; Grandads who have served &amp; paid the ultimate sacrifice. #WeWillRememberThem #RemembranceDay  https://t.co/JVMYgPKX1O<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ktsheaf3007851 I don’t think I’ll get invited in! 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hear @realDonaldTrump is playing golf - even if he watched his beloved #FoxNews they are confirming #Biden won and Trump lost. The broadcaster has been distancing itself from #Trump for a couple days as it began clear he would lose.  https://t.co/rSsPcs24BA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has he not switched on the news?! #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All change at The White House! Joe Biden finally wins #USElection He has reached the 270 electoral votes after winning Pennsylvania. #BIDEN  #bidenharis2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very measured and dare I say it Presidential #bidenspeech overnight. “Democracy works. Your vote will be counted....we may be opponents but we are not enemies. We are Americans” #Election2020 #USElectionResults2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This morning I talked about how the hospitality sector needed more long term support - it appears the chancellor has offered that by extending #furlough until March.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PipTomson I haven’t noticed a change - in central London this morning and spent most of it sitting in traffic.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Erm....ok then #NigelFarage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Extraordinary speech by #Trump claiming he has won the election but then saying there has been electoral fraud going on. Neither at this stage is correct. Postal ballots are still being legitimately counted and a few key states are yet to declare. #USElection<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lively and comprehensive coverage of #USElection2020 on @GMB I’m at Westminster with U.K. reaction. Momentum seems to be edging towards #Trump defying the polls but crucial swing state results not declared.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good summary of weeks of #USAElections2020 campaigning and unpredictable results by @piersmorgan 👇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The crucial state of Florida is won by #Trump It’s very early but it’s a big win in a polarised state. #USElection @GMB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The best insight I’ve heard all night is that: Accurate polling in an era of Donald Trump is impossible. Pollsters just can’t get to the vast majority of Trump voters. We will see. #USElection  #USElection2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In America today it should be about the power of the vote but sadly and hopefully not it could end up being about the power of the military - if disorder breaks out. #AmericaDecides2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>“It’s not just up to the Premier League to help other clubs as it’s the government who are banning fans from watching matches” Mark Catlin CEO @Pompey on @GMB @piersmorgan @susannareid100  https://t.co/RzAk3W2Is6<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We’re in safe hands - former England goalkeeper David James is with us as a report highlights 4,000 grassroots football clubs could close due to Covid restrictions. @GMB  https://t.co/8npw8oULHq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But what is also happening elsewhere in the world when you speak to people in Asia &amp; Germany is the majority of the population are complying with the rules and wearing masks, not looking at ways to get round the latest restrictions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Following the terrible shooting of a police officer in #Croydon, officers tell me they need more support to stop and search - as it’s  become so controversial in the last few years.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Having spoken to @Shmee150 who has spend months filming in Germany - he says the reason they have more of a control on #Covid_19 is because the German population comply with the rules. They all wear masks and continue to social distance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here we go...more restrictions coming I think. Scientists warn of 50,000 coronavirus cases per day by mid-October without action.   https://t.co/eTt9gyngig<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I think the conversation got a little #rudy after this clip - even  @piersmorgan had to end the interview. #rudi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Such depressing news tonight - after reporting around the world on Madeleine’s disappearance with hope since 2007 - German police say they have initiated proceedings against the suspect on suspicion of murdering #MadeleineMccann<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BREAKING Update from German police on #MadeleineMccann They say the suspect was sentenced on numerous occasions to prison terms for sexual abuse of children in the past. They also add he broke into hotel complexes &amp; holiday flats as well as drug offences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BreakingNews The German suspect has also been linked to a 1993 Jaguar XJR6 with a German number plate seen in the resort in 2006 &amp; 2007. The day after #MadeleineMccann went missing, the suspect got the car re-registered in Germany. @piersmorgan @susannareid100<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BreakingNews The #MadeleineMccann suspect was seen driving his camper van in Praia Du Luz in the days before she disappeared.

<|startoftext|>#BreakingNews significant development in #MadeleineMccann case. Police say a German man is said to be a "significant suspect".

<|startoftext|>As we mentioned this morning @pritipatel confirms plans to force all travellers to UK to isolate for 14 days from Monday. Failure to comply could result in £1000 fine or prosecution. Travel &amp; hospitality industry warning it could result in big job cuts.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Dominic Raab says people can play tennis with people from their household but not sports such as football in the park as social distancing could not be enforced. @piersmorgan @susannareid100<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It’s not just the UK where arguments rage about lack of PPE and how unprepared we were - France is similar, if not worse as Macron adopts a more humble tone to the nation. Germany on the other hand is showing how it should be done. #COVID19 #coronavirusuk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlanChand I am well thank you! I hope you are?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is how to do it. #coronavirus cases falling in South Korea yet they still take precautions and social distance to ensure there isn’t a second deadly spread. Worth noting - as lockdowns don’t get lifted overnight. @GMB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But an army of volunteers around the country with 3D printers are trying the fill the gap by producing face masks for NHS and now care homes  https://t.co/9yrUMf7ZzP<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#BBC salaries being spun by Beeb as a more equal pay between men and women whilst perhaps missing the point that why do so many presenters, many of whom aren’t widely know getting so much in the first place. @GMB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lovely video from #Lionesses in a world of corporations, sponsorship and agents...the true believers and backers....Mums and Dads. @GMB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeShuttle hello I’m struggling to book online as it won’t allow me to pay. Can I pay at Calais? She is the next available train? Thanks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not a bad view this morning. Enjoying the cool temperature before  it ramps up again today. The ‘Saharan heat bubble’ is on its way to Britain! Enjoy live from #Paris on @GMB  https://t.co/CkZD3Us0rr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The River Seine is a popular spot in Paris tonight for locals and tourists - it must be the cooling effect of the water or the view! @GMB  https://t.co/XmoiZnobcv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sunny and stifling but serious warnings for the #heatwave in France. Just been with authorities in #Paris who are distributing water bottles, sun cream and t-shirts to vulnerable people after many deaths last time they had temps like this. @GMB @itvnews  https://t.co/fk0xFrdlWw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In heat above 30c  being stuck in a car on one of the craziest roundabouts in the world is a challenge. Hot humid air hitting Europe and it’s certainly that in #Paris.  @GMB  https://t.co/gqwzyHh8cY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Leaving the battlefields of northern France behind and now heading to Paris where temperatures are expected to reach 40° C this week. #heatwave  https://t.co/VP3Xp3yg9x<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I’m really struck by the ongoing work by @CWGC to discover our our fallen war hero’s. A centre opens today in Arras to reveal the painstaking work of identifying those who died in battle. @PoppyLegion @GMB  https://t.co/Z4No2f4v5g<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Focus on #BBC as #TVLicence fee campaign by @piersmorgan &amp; @susannareid100 is leading to #boycottbbc unless broadcaster backtracks on decision. @GMB  https://t.co/DePyPAgY6E<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our big talking point this morning! Will the #BBC now have a rethink on #TVLicence fee ? @piersmorgan @susannareid100<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In response to my question about #WaistcoatWednesday !  https://t.co/rLqrzKS224<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Southgate: (on prep for #ENGCRO ) we haven’t changed how we train or our routines. Our families came into camp a couple of days ago as they have done throughout the tournament. #ENG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Southgate: “Our country has been through some difficult experiences recently in terms of unity. Sport, and football particularly, has the power to help (address) that. It is a special feeling and privilege for us” #ENG #ENGCRO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In Moscow as #Southgate answers my question about the craze #WaistcoatWednesday sweeping England. On @GMB tomorrow @piersmorgan @susannareid100  https://t.co/DHtuamRp5E<|endoftext|>
