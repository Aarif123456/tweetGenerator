<|startoftext|>@LLinWood All news saying it is over and was free and fair election.  So wth? There is so much evidence we want to know what is going on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jason, would love to know 2 things.  How are you approved for PAU til end of December then unapproved near the last few months?  How can they justify someone being unapproved for PAU after being approved and wait over a month to inform that person?  This is strange and wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@action9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sure would have been nice to be told the end of Oct or beginning of November.  Now I am in a major crisis due to not only more shutdowns but being kept in the dark for over a month.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>for over a month to learn they are no longer getting PAU, govenment funding, and now with nothing left I am told, "oh, you were denied"  After I had been approved in April for PAU until end of December.  Love some press on this treatment of people's lives @action9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoyCooperNC @NCDES   Roy, I WAS on PAU, I am no longer for some reason, even after you shutdown the state more.  The big problem is have not received money since Nov 9th. Acct had been pending for over a month, and now a MONTH later I am told?  How can you make someone wait<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimKardashian Lucky his family is alive. If I were him I'd say take me to my death. You are looking at true evil. No? Could you have done what he did? And live with yourself.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CNNPR @CNN @FoxNews @jaketapper @MSNBC And the WWE still gets better ratings.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thehill @RepMattGaetz @GOP @GOPLeader   How can you fools not understand Beer and Liquor are 100x worse than Marijuana.  We don't need law enforcement messing with this crap when we have a massive explosion of deadly drugs killing our youth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN @ABCWorldNews @NBCNews @FoxNews @CBSNews   I do not care about Covid of you don't care about voter fraud.

<|startoftext|>@BrianKempGA   Texas is coming for you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman Sadly in 4 years it will all be loses unless every republican in every state starts demanding answers for this fraudulent election.  We can all see it, do something.  You all only won due to @POTUS and we are to believe he lost?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@newsmax @GOP @GOPLeader   We the people see widespread voter fraud. Stop this fraud, reveal the steal, or it is over. Democrats will rule America because we are done supporting Dem bitches. Stand up and fight back.  This is not Fix Later. Now or never. Now they know how to cheat<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FBI @TheJusticeDept @POTUS   THERE SHOULD BE NO "CLITCHES"  Most of us work with company computers and there are no clitches.  So not sure what the hell but one clitch put the whole system in question.  Not a Valid election, get some BALLS and hold a real ONE DAY election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@garciaforphx @dougducey @SidneyPowell1 @AZGOP Either come clean or got to jail. Pretty easy decision if it where me. Not going to jail for anyone. But say hey to your cell mate as a broom handle is introduced to your bottom. They will love y'all in prision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LLinWood @BreitbartNews And what does it matter. Is this saying if you're a Democrat you shouldn't care about voter fraud.  I wish you where so you could stand up and say, I am Democrat and this election is wrong.  We should ALL want this fixed and fair.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>How can you feel so advanced when you are an adult and still, "um" and "uh".  In life that is shady behavior @CNNPR   You know why?   Because it is this easy not to, like to know?  You just don't say them. It is that easy.  So that us why it is shady and unprofessional.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN @CNNPR #CNN #CNNExposed @POTUS #CNNCalls   Hey CNN, it's called a leak.   BTW, the one thing that stood out the most was all your "um" and "uh".

<|startoftext|>@AnnCoulter @nytimes why is it so hard for any of your many staff to contact some witnesses to voter fraud?  It's called Journalism.  Kinda sad University could and should stop teaching journalism, no one uses it anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMattGaetz There are A LOT of questions that need to be answered.  If people we NOT allowed to view the counting then how is it valid?  Many have came forward.  How can voting machines be trusted?  Many have came forward.  What the hell @TheJusticeDept   Serving a Banana Republic is no fun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>or let the US die.  We have had enough of this crap, so do something or it's everyone for themselves.   If you do not uphold THE LAW, why do we need you or recognize your authority.  Is this the America you want?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@POTUS @GOP @FBI @TheJusticeDept  Not sure what everyone is doing, but if any of you want your kid's children to have a safe place to live you need to get on the ball.  We see this but hear nothing from THE LAW!!!!    You are to uphold the law,   https://t.co/QTmTbhfo6p<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SharylAttkisson Explanation: There is a way to kill the virus. Let it die. How? Everyone stays in place for 2 weeks. You go no where. The military brings you food. This doesn't allow the virus to spread, so it dies off. That is called communism. The US could do such if our government was one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBergquam Should be laws. Can't do crap like that until they hit puberty.  Ever seen the story of the girl parents thought wanted to be a boy so they let her.  Then puberty hit and she no longer wanted to be a boy, she wanted to attract a boy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RepDougCollins We need a re-vote with a hand count.  And if left wants to do what they do, they count them then Republicans count them and if counts don't match, count them again.  We have enough people in America to count votes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@newtgingrich @dailycallout Here is what I don't understand. It seems everyone can check their vote online. The devil is in the details. Can this database be searched for cheating?

<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani @dailycallout More hell needs to be raised about counts being stopped on election night. I have NEVER seen that, WTH. Everyone should have to stand where they stopped. To bad, makes it seem they cheating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani @dailycallout I'd say if Smartmatic wants to remain in business they better get on board.

<|startoftext|>@RepMattGaetz If me I would investigate everyone.  I am sure some families would like to know what seems to be happening in retirement homes.  And the lawsuits against the rest homes. Time for this election to be recalled until arrest made.  This is a threat to @POTUS , where is Secret Service<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HouseGOP @GOPLeader Ask them what happen in February.  https://t.co/szkkzSxeAp<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@timkaine Like in TX before the election when a Biden/Harris person was arrested for ballot harvesting?  Sit down and hold @realDonaldTrump beer.  You are busted. This one got out of hand due to all the votes for @POTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Strangely quite today on Twitter.  Hope that means something is going down.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RepMattGaetz Then to me each voter in areas of concern is contacted.  With Benford's Law you can find where to look.  The votes after the fact, that cannot be witnessed needs to be verified.  Get people on the phones, no matter how long it takes.  Or, re-vote.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TIME Check your math.  Benford does not like when his law is broken.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So they like science, but not math?  Benford was all good in 2016, but says his law was broke in 2020 election. Math does not lie.  #BidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBSNews @beckerdavidj I thought @TheDemocrats were the party of math and science? Just ignore Benford? #NotMyPresident #NotOurPresident<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FightOwensFight @Goldberg When Laws get broke it's go time.  Math does not lie and education helps.  Benford called, and said he was good in 2016, but says he has some major problems in 2020.   https://t.co/0sHIyVEDeh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donlemon One thing you will never hear on this show is math.  Benford's Law is knocking.   https://t.co/0sHIyVEDeh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRightMelissa @JayneZirkle @realDonaldTrump And math proves the fraud.   https://t.co/0sHIyVEDeh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaheemKassam @JayneZirkle Benford's Law has major issues with this election.   https://t.co/0sHIyVEDeh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SharylAttkisson Benford's Law is hard to ignore.   https://t.co/0sHIyVEDeh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BobOxler111 @Change Here is a good read. Hope they on this.  https://t.co/0sHIyVEDeh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Project_Veritas Find some mathematicians.  This election and Benford's Law have some major issues. And that is the red flag as to where to look.  Social media wants to censor this for one tiny part that has nothing to do with the math, but math does not lie.   https://t.co/0sHIyVEDeh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CBSNews   Oh heck no, @AlabamaFTBL is on tonight.  We don't need a fake election that is not over interrupting.  You got a cable station, put that fake news on there.  And hope you break in when @realDonaldTrump ends up winning.  If ifs and buts, saying it doesn't make it real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC   Just curious what would dems do if shoe on the other foot.  @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump  @RudyGiuliani   Can we organize and We The People can Check every vote online and make sure they are real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump   I am no genius, but with so many votes for a president but not for a senator is a red flag.  This shows cheating but not affecting the senate race, which would have all Rep pissed.  Things do not add up, please don't stop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abcnews @ABCPolitics @ABCWorldNews   When did projected become elected?  This is very irresponsible. Can lead to major rioting if @realDonaldTrump is proven the winner.  https://t.co/BtOoi1lYDL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris @SharylAttkisson @JoeBiden What, got a new sugardaddy?  Election is FAR from over hun, hate it for all the snowflakes, but wait and see, @realDonaldTrump will win this election. You have been here before, feel familiar? So will the heartbreak.  Once again we will say, TOLD YA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris @SharylAttkisson @JoeBiden Buckle up snowflake. Gore held out til Dec 19th for one state.  And we got evidence like you never seen.  Not the 60s and 70s anymore.   Money and fame amd integrity win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Loving all the Blue confidence, think I seem this movie before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Going to be so fun watching all the people who believe @JoeBiden won when all the evidence and truth comes out. The @AP does not decide the election. And your boy @algore didn't give up on one state til Dec 19th. So buckle up snowflakes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Projected is not the same as elected. Go get them Trump. We have seen and heard this before. Be a great do to see the snowflakes upset again.  https://t.co/t1AH4c4Xwk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYGovCuomo @SharylAttkisson @KamalaHarris Not ours.   And see all the snowflakes soon when @realDonaldTrump wins.  We get to laugh again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes it is.  Projected is not elected.  The AP is very irresponsible and if riots break when @realDonaldTrump wins, they need to be held accountable.  And should someone ask the FBI if it is over? #BidenHarris2020 fraud  https://t.co/3YybQB94n6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SharylAttkisson RN @abcnews says "Projected"  That is not ELECTED.  And irresponsible of the Media, or AP and them and the Dem Party should be held accountable if @realDonaldTrump wins and riots start. To much evidence and computer glitches to call it. But we seen it before. #Biden #2020Election  https://t.co/umiab0nxqH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When @realDonaldTrump wins this election and rioting and looting break out, the @AP should be held legally responsible along with @TheDemocrats.  It is not responsible to call an election with mounting evidence of wrong doing, computer glitches, and whistleblowers. #AuditTheVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Biden   This will be fun seeing this taken away from them.  @realDonaldTrump has valid evidence and @JoeBiden wants to claim victory.  #bidenharis2020 #Election2020 #JoeBiden   Hard to call an election when voter fraud is in play, and it is not going away.  Be ready snowflakes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Claim it loudly! @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris  We seen this show before. Celebrate to early so when @realDonaldTrump wins your based will be more upset.  Get ready snowflakes, more disappointment coming.  Over 100 Whistleblowers don't just go away. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  #bidenharis2020<|endoftext|>

Find these two  https://t.co/mfLFwbIpbO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden has proven Mial In does not work.  Our question is if so many mailed in, why did the majority of those get mailed at the last minute.   That makes no sense. Pay each one of those voters a visit @FBI  @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This will sink @JoeBiden   Can @FBI get on this. They have computers.  I imagine a lot of folks will be lying to the FBI.  Joe better call this, or it will all come out.  People on the inside #JoeBidenKamalaHarris2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris people.  @realDonaldTrump @Project_Veritas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kind if reminds you of the old days when @TheDemocrats did this all the time.  Use to force and beats blacks to vote for them.  @JoeBiden is an old school Democrat.  @realDonaldTrump I am going to start a non profit where we will go back and check voters in all from last 20 years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On me thing that is very sad.  How @JoeBiden will be remembered in history.  Another Benedict Arnold.  Nothing good to show, just a life of hate, lies and cheating.  And doubt he even knows it.  #JillBiden should be ashamed.  @KamalaHarris @POTUS #ElectionResults2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden @KamalaHarris @realDonaldTrump #ElectionResults2020   Dems are so out of touch they don't even understand what this means.  US election is to big to steal.  What that means is you will get caught. To many hands involved and people will talk and spies are in place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris @JoeBiden   This goes deeper than a few workers. This is from the top and can be traced.  Guess Kamie's political life will be over.  @realDonaldTrump when this happenes all of these need to be banned from politics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris @JoeBiden   Get them @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris @SharylAttkisson Cheaters.  If @JoeBiden robs this election then they will be the leaders God put in, so it will not be a sin to lie cheat and steal.  @realDonaldTrump has eyes/spies everywhere.   Many going to jail because of Dem leaders. 3 1/2 years.  Dems never learn and all blows up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Will_holliday1 @realDonaldTrump lock them up.  @JoeBiden then will be sued by them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JudicialWatch @TomFitton Biden 264 best joke ever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDemocrats will never recover from this. They have pulled off nothing in 4 years and now they think no one will go undercover to protect an election?  @SpeakerPelosi hope you know what is coming. The evidence will destroy your party.  Poor @JoeBiden #ThePostElection<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Coming unraveled.  Why do @TheDemocrats not care so many will be going to jail.  @realDonaldTrump spies are everywhere. @JoeBiden should know that. #ThePostElection<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChristianBogna4 @TheDemocrats @realDonaldTrump Hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the love will be over.  @TheDemocrats are kids, they don't learn the basics.   Cheaters never win.  Lost to be answered for @JoeBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel @TheDemocrats are freaking out right now seeing how busted they are going to be after all the smoke clears.  @realDonaldTrump has so many spies at these places.  This will drain the swamp and should end their party. After so many go to jail or plea deal  #ThePostElection<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden has picked a fight he wants no part. Jail coming for some.  And he has to know Trump spies are everywhere.  I bet many will be shocked when @realDonaldTrump shows his cards.  When you know what is coming you put your pieces in play.  Trump plays chess, dems checkers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden @SpeakerPelosi   Just a heads up for you.  This is the US and anyone can be a spy or informant.   Hasn't @realDonaldTrump shown you he is that smart.  Poor people going to jail for rich white people. #ElectionResults2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3 1/2 years in jail is a lot for someone never been.  And that's federal prison.  See, it seems fun and all when they say you won't get caught.  But now it is real.  The funny part, you don't think Trump has people undercover in these places.  Come on man.  #ElectionResults2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden @TheDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi #VoterSuppression #ElectionResults2020 @realDonaldTrump @GOP   I have seen enough to say there is enough evidence in many states for EVERY vote to be inspected and confirmed.

<|startoftext|>@AP Yea, good luck claiming that.  Just ignore all the evidence of voter fraud coming out.  Need an * beside that.  @realDonaldTrump will reveal the truth.  Has he failed yet? Have the dems pulled any crap like this off?  Going to be fun seeing the media eat all of this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden   3 1/2 years is how long you will be sitting in jail because of @SpeakerPelosi and Biden.  Come forward now and save yourself and maybe get paid.  #ElectionResults2020 #ElectionMeddling #Elections2020   @realDonaldTrump will get to the truth. Has he failed yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden and @TheDemocrats have broken the law and the world sees it.  @realDonaldTrump up in every swing state and counting stops.

<|startoftext|>Here you go @JoeBiden great work.  @realDonaldTrump has eyes and ears everywhere. And it will all come out.  Make America Great Again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden and @SpeakerPelosi thinks none of the people will talk when they looking at years on jail?  @TheDemocrats are digging a hole for themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is worse than this @realDonaldTrump. Lock them up, @JoeBiden is going to ruin a lot of people's lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden hidden camera everywhere, come on man, you have not won these states.  Joe is sending people to jail.  @TheDemocrats will have to settle a big time lawsuit for people they got arrested.  Going to be fun watching @TheDemocrats and @SpeakerPelosi crumble again.<|endoftext|>

Joe will send people to jail, and the whole world will see how dirty @TheDemocrats still are.  Since their beginning.  @realDonaldTrump won already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joebiden  We just going to leave all this evidence here so maybe you will fight for your people not to go to jail, and concede.   @SpeakerPelosi has stepped in it this time.  @realDonaldTrump will not stop, when has he?  And ever stunt has blown up in their face.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden will be viewed as the dumb old man who allowed other people to cheat for him in another political election.  He has a history of cheating and @realDonaldTrump will now end it and put a lot of people in Jail for a loss.  Only way out call @POTUS, concede and beg him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden man either concede or @realDonaldTrump will see this through.   Be another election of congress and Seanate after people go to jail.  Or don't, I got my popcorn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arneduncan This is a brainwashing technique, be aware, stay alert.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Sailer @AnnCoulter That is a brain washing technique, be aware.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden   The evidence mounts against @TheDemocrats by the time all the fraud is erased they may lose some house and congress seats. @realDonaldTrump will get to the truth.  Money will get people to talk, man.   https://t.co/8VHGKKAbiR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden   It is getting real man, get out of the basement.  People going to jail bro, your people.  Rock it @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden it keeps getting deeper and deeper.  Look at these people who will be in jail because of you.   Or will they Flip?  Concede man, it is over and @TheDemocrats already look bad.  @realDonaldTrump is the President and winner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden more people going to jail because you and yours wants to cheat.  @realDonaldTrump has won.  Send them all to jail if he doesn't concede.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Claim victory. Once heads start to roll Biden will bow out, or send A Lot of people to jail. @JoeBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden concede man, this is starting to not only look bad for you, but the whole Democrat party.  This will lose even more voters in the future.  What is @SpeakerPelosi going to do now.  A lot of Biden supporters going to be in jail. And telling on everyone on TV.  @POTUS wins<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden the world is watching and this is what you want them to see.  Joe sending people to jail. Hope it is worth it.  We The People will get the truth.  Big money for those who talk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden sending people to jail.  Joe must not realize everyone has a camera.  Lock them up @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden   Lock them up @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@conservatyler @w_terrence Yea, seen the video where the lady was forcing people to fill them out that way.  @JoeBiden sending lots of people to jail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricTrump I have a feeling all will fall in line.  @JoeBiden has to see they are being busted everywhere and now will call off the fix.   People going to talk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden @KamalaHarris you two don't believe people will go to jail over this?  I would sue you and @TheDemocrats   Y'all stupid.  @realDonaldTrump won 2020!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden are you sure you want to go through all this?  Promise you @realDonaldTrump will get to the truth.  Enjoy the stress you created for yourself Joe.  All the states truth will come out and we will see how history remembers you. An old man that tried to cheat to win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricTrump All the people that go to jail need to sue @JoeBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Evidence is mounting. And you will not be able to pardon them.  I hope everyone busted for fraud sues you.  @POTUS is the winner hands down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @POTUS   Claim the Victory. It is yours hands down.  All the cheating we are seeing, claim it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden @SharylAttkisson Going to get a lot of good people sent to jail. SMH.  Joe, everything has blown up in your faces. This in time end will hurt your party more.  If you were up by 10 points in PA it would be called.   This and you are the same, a joke. @POTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So sad @JoeBiden and @TheDemocrats will be sending so many to jail.  $ rewards and fame for proof of voter fraud.  @realDonaldTrump #Vote2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump  Give it up Joe.  This election will hurt @TheDemocrats in the future worse than anything ever.   It all blows up in their face. This video shows why they will get caught, money.   https://t.co/4xIuqw4WAz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricTrump No way, not just @realDonaldTrump all the other candidates also, not one.  This needs to be explained @JoeBiden @TheDemocrats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Make sure you are watching @newsmax, @abcnews @CBSNews @NBCNews @CNN @FoxNews get crappy ratings all year, so don't bail them out in the ratings now.  And we know @POTUS has won, if not and @JoeBiden won it would be over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSNBC @maddow Dignified? Wow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IAmJericho Only when a Republican is leading. Never for a Democrat, those called by 10p.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AinsworthKeith I am sure the Feds will have something to say about this.  Class C.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden @TheDemocrats @GOP   #Election2020 happens once every 4 years.  I am so thankful Republican ran states can count.  Why would anyone want a Dem to run anything.  They can't even count after 10pm. Polls barley closed and they go home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDemocrats wonder why they keep losing votes, it's because of crap like this #StopTheSteal #Election2020   We the people are smarter than you think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden   It amazes me when a Democrat wins the election all the votes get counted.   Why is it only like this when a Republican wins?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abcnews @CNN @FoxNews @NBCNews @CBSNews @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump #Trump2020  @TheDemocrats @newsmax   Should have let Trump claim his victory tonight.  Know this, we got people everywhere. Try some fraud and we will see it. You will be caught and go to jail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@newsmax   AP has Ga at 93% reporting and Trump up 120k.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABCPolitics @NBCNews @abcnews @NBCPolitics @CBSNews @FoxNews   So funny I am learning about who won what state online 30 minutes before Network news will say.  @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Your Like Robots are not very consistent.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WolfVanHalen @usweekly A lot of people started crap like this.  With you. Hardly ever heard about Eddie while he was alive, and now they want to cash in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abcnews @GMA   There use to be a reason you didn't talk about politics.  This is why. Newspaper article from late 1800s.  https://t.co/gh642mBHDm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden 100s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan This is effective brain washing by the left.  https://t.co/9jfjDwWM4f<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WolfVanHalen True EVH fans want no part of another Van Halen. There was only one EVH. I have never seen but one person duplicate Eddie and that is a guy named Steve Senes, YT him.  I want Wolfgang. All we need is for him to take the same approach to music his dad taught him. No rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Wow, like they were planning for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why would someone want to watch their back 24/7. Never know what crazy will be there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Yea, thanks, still haven't gotten insurance from not being able to afford when you did this.  And thanks for fining us for not having. So much logic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden @HamillHimself Got him a job too, uh?  Friends with Hunter?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Like you ended Ebloa and Sars and Aids?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Still nothing about   STOP RIOTING.  What good does a mask do when we have rioting and you say nothing, which says a lot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Climate always changes.  Seas have been rising for 20,000 years.  Why will no scientists come forward and take questions on the topic? Not one.  Why is the Sun never mentioned? Gravitational Pull? Moon?  CO2 is good for the planet.  Why FEAR?  Give it up #ClimateActionNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Um, Joe, we know now China had the virus in September 19, maybe August.  What does that science tell you?  Y'all #BidenHarris2020 people don't think.  #ChinaVirus #BidenCorruption #coronavirus<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Do not vote for @RoyCooperNC   I have been unemployed due to his policies since April. Approved to Dec, but for no reason it has been reviewed for a month now.  Why Roy? Already approved but you stop money?  This man needs to go. Guess I won't pay bills in November.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr #BidenHarrisLandslide2020 #TRUMP2020ToSaveAmerica   Shows how racist Dems are when they say we have never been more devided.  The party of slaves would say that. We were once so devided we went to war.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PeteButtigieg Not condemning rioting and hurting people is like being against seat belts.  What the hell good does a mask mandate do it thousands of people are protesting and rioting.   That called not the brightest light on the tree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidhogg111 Hahaha, wow, can't stop laughing at how dumb the left truly is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@F1   That was all Max, it's practice, not one good reason to try that @redbullracing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NPRpubliceditor And why no one pays attention to Democrat news they want to brainwash you with on NPR. More Democrat slaves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden   This man is a liar and to all that support him i will make my own prediction.  If Joe wins the stock market will crash the next day and gas will be over 4.00 by April.  You believe a full time liar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benshapiro Lost mine and was then fined for not having. That's Democrat logic.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris @JoeBiden I like how you try to make it about someone not wanting them to vote. Wow, nothing to run on uh?  Nobody had not wanted people to vote. We just feel you should PROVE you are who you are, only vote once and so on.  By your reaction we assume you must be cheating to demand such.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Christmas is so dumb. @CBSBigBrother #BB22   It's the POV then HOH. She acts as if it is to be handed to her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden 15 days left, if Joe wins be ready to a huge market crash, followed by high gas prices, followed by no jobs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And @TroyAikman so will @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris.  Promise you this rich boy, if #BidenHarrisLandslide2020 the stock market will crash like never before, high gas prices, and no jobs to start.  But @TheDemocrats are so smart.  Obama: "We have to manage the decline."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TroyAikman   The biggest waste of money is flying two sportscaster fly around to call games that are temporary and unnecessary.  And now we know you can do it from home. Take a pay cut and stay there.  And Troy, I DARE YOU TO LOOK UP HOW MUCH @BarackObama SPENT ON VACATIONS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harrisonjaime @LindseyGrahamSC  There it is, make it about skin color.  @TheDemocrats need to say they condem the riots and violence. That you will not spend 3 years doing FAKE investigations that @BarackObama did, and impeachment @JoeBiden did. Not electing to do nothing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SteveKrak This is what should stand out about the left.  They only use science when it benefits them.  This kind of stuff helps no one, for Identity Crisis Disorder is REAL.  The left says if you think you are Churchill, live it.  #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom What are they lying about? Some facts we know. They used 24K scientists who said Climate is dire, but then we found out not one scientists only people on a web page. They use 49 scientists to make their case, in which all 49 came out and said their work was taken out of context.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom What are they not telling us? Ever noticed Climate Experts never mention the Sun. The thing that drives the whole planet is left out of the equation. Why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom I love a good mystery. To solve a mystery this is what I have learned. Pay attention to all the details. Pay extra attention to what they don't tell you. And lastly pay attention to all lies.  Let's put this to practice on Climate Change. We have all the details.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NBCSports   You got 15 minutes of racing left, Horse racing is when? 5;30?  No cable, I gave @NASCAR_Xfinity @NASCAR a chance and we get this. Wow, 15 minutes. And you go to 8 commercials.   Why can't horse start on NBCN.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just for historical purposes. Sports were created by govenments to distract people from sticking their noses into politics. A reward is normally free. @NBA #NBAPlayoffs  Now examine who has wants and still wants to keep outsider out of politics. Want change vote @TheDemocrats out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBA Glad NBA has proof. Do it when due process is allowed. Tired of this crap. As I said, with this logic, quit, for then you are saying Kobe was a rapist. Maybe one day women will matter. Right @KamalaHarris what about Vanina Guerrero? ESPN and TNT wants their money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBA @KingJames   This is how smart these people are. See, college does matter.  If continues it will be the end of the NBA or the end of big money contracts. All your contracts will be null and void.  And lose the mic. Wow, these guys are so brave and smart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems to me the @TheDemocrats @NBA @ESPNNBA @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris would begin demanding everyone to wait for an investigation, wait and see. Why?

<|startoftext|>@SIChrisMannix Police reform is easy @NBA   Get the Democrats out of your cities.  Why not a change? #Vote #VoteRedToSaveAmerica2020   Vote Republican and see how your city can change for the better.  So odd these things happen in democrat run states.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@espn So since we are now a world where you are GUILTY until proven innocent, then with Logic Kobe was a RAPIST.@Lakers great job.  BTW, check your ratings.  Also, so far y'all have a track record of being WRONG.   So far we seen 2 protested and riots for and 2 the cops where right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBA @KingJames   For one stop pushing your judgment before an investigation. You seen the FB video by now, je died from the drugs he ingested. So from what all you do guess that means Kobe was GUILTY OF RAPE!!!!  And also, no one is watching, and this is the real reason.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoyCooperNC @NCGOP   Roy needs to lose on his handling of Unemployment.  They get the money then a month or two later people get it.  What happens with all the interest from all that Federal Money sitting in the bank.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NC_Governor   Glad you will not be in office much longer.  Want to gripe and complain about Money that is not yours.  @realDonaldTrump is the only on who has been doing his job FOR 3+ DAMN YEARS.  Now y'all want him to do this and that, while Dems have done nothing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @GOPLeader @GOP @POTUS @DonaldJTrumpJr   Numbers are also higher due to after testing positive, people must have 2 Negative test before returning to work.  How do we know if a new case is really an old case, just a retest?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@POTUS @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @GOPLeader @GOP   You all can do the research, but let everyone know  Tiktok is not a spying app, it is an app so Pedophiles can watch kids.

<|startoftext|>@nytimes Then don't go where you are not suppose to be.  And, is not your state Democrat? So why attack, and yes, you are attacking, I haven't seen in protest in Portland, Fed building ran by democrats.  If not happy then vote Republican and see a good change.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BubbaWallace Wow, all we have heard from Bubba for 3 weeks of hate, made up hate.

<|startoftext|>@TheFallBackUp @MattWalshBlog Thousands of years they were here and fought each other the whole time. Looked at other tribes as dogs.

<|startoftext|>@NASCAR @BubbaWallace  Social Justice.  If true, this us what we want.  To Nascar to tell how Jesse Jackson extorted money from Nascar for years.

<|startoftext|>#riots2020 #protests2020 #floydprotests   I am done when you start killing innocent animals.   Don't care, don't want to hear it. You killed a horse and put eye out on another.  Great job, completely innocent and you abuse and kill, an animal?  F all of you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've never seen worse management than @HBO @hbomax   So simple it is stupid.  Make one app! Who wants HBO only for same price.  Canceled till Max is on Roku.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CDCgov Fake news.   If it is so contagious then we should see a major outbreak in ever city with potest or riots.  If no outbreak, it is all fake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abcnews   Seems all they want to do is attack @realDonaldTrump.  And you use Biden? Forgot he said they not black enough uh?   @JoeBiden is part of the problem.  Name 1 thing he or Obama did for race in 8 years? We will wait.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#RIOT #protests2020 #GeorgeFloydProtests   Do you want to know what the root problem is? It is not race.  The root problem is:  COPS THINK THEY ARE BETTER THAN EVERYONE.  That leads to a dangerous mindset.  If you want change, that's where it starts.  @abcnews @CBSNews @CNN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abcnews by far one of the most dishonest news in the world.  When your job is to report the truth you can report it how you see it but how things are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abcnews @NBCNews @CBSNews @CNN @MSNBC @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump #Covid_19 #nycprotests   So if no major outbreak of COV then we will know for a fact that is was all fake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NC_Governor Days are numbered. He can do this but not all the GOP in CLt. Gone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ajplus It is against the Law in the US to block traffic. No one has ever been charged for hitting those blocking the road. Did you see a 4 year old almost died, they set her building on fire then tried to block the fire department. So, yea, cheer on them blocking the roads, your kid nxt<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Hope you're getting paid enough to get you out of jail. And the guy paying needs to be picked up by the FBI today and questioned till he cries for his mom.  #protests2020 #Riot2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#protests2020 #riots2020   So odd black people allow white hate groups take over and spoil their protest.  Seems if we want the Real message heard everyone needs to take out the trouble makers.  Get them, hand them over and the have your peaceful powerful protest.  They cancel it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@POTUS @realDonaldTrump #riots2020   Urge all cities with riots to effectively go to Marshal Law. We need US citizens to understand they and their property are protected.  It will also teach them a valuable lesson. Freedom is not free and can be taken if you don't deserve.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we now see Cov19 was a hoax.  #GeorgeFloydProtests #riots2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abcnews @CBSNews @NBCNews @MSNBC @CNN @FoxNews   Don't care anything about all you have said for 4 months.  SOCIAL DISTANCE  WEAR MASK  STAY HOME  And we see Protestors only care for themselves.  Be ready for another spike and I won't feel sorry for them.  See how fake it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABCNetwork  #riots2020  Show Jordan and the Last Dance, ratings through the roof.  Switch to some sort of riot coverage with mostly old video, ratings tank and we go to Netflix or other.  Hope you reschedule and show starting with episode 4.  Have fun covering crooks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Breaking911 @SharylAttkisson They can shoot all they want and no one will blame them.  When a few get shot the rest will flee.  Want the wild west then be the wild west.  Get the shotguns that way you get more than one.  Man up police, protect our freedom.  #riots2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABCNetwork @Disney @abcnews   All the chaos is cause and effect.  I promise everyone, if no one covered riots they would not happen.  Why would they if not making the news?  #riots2020 #CommonSense<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @CDCgov   Hate to say it, but the numbers do not add up in the US to the data around the world.  Why?  How do we get more cases than countries that had no shut down?  Makes no sense y'all. The data shouts something is wrong or up.  Need to explain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wsoctv   Unemployment  We live in the south, where we are not paid much due to COL.  The Federal Government cannot give according to State's COL.  The people in CA &amp; NYC do not see the extra from CARES Act as enough.  BTW, 1 Trillion is 1,000,000,000,000 Billion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abcnews   They think y'all are idots. ABC knows how stupid you all are if you don't understand what Trump means. Wow, if so this is a sad world and some need to be woke.  #sarcasm #lysol #COVID #WokeAF<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WWE   Will @WWEBrayWyatt and @JohnCena ever have their match we were told would happen at Mania?   Not a match if no wrestling took place, which is common for Bray.  Is the Fiend done due to Bray able to talk good but can't wrestle?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wsoctv   The most danger is touching your face.  A NYC Dr. Said be a hand washing Nazi.  Do not touch your face, and really what the mask does.  Wash your hands and don't touch your face and we should be fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wsoctv   I was wondering if people are wearing mask thinking it protects them?  If the virus is in the air it will enter your eyes as easy as mouth and nose.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @POTUS   We need help.  In NC we can't get on unemployment website or via phone.  What the hell?  We can't work, and now can't get our money.  FIX THIS!  HAVE THEM APPROVE ALL AND THEN FIX PROBLEMS.  DAMN<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader How does aid help if you put rules on it?  Some may be behind on our taxes,  Does that mean they don't need help?  I'm for @realDonaldTrump @GOP but this will decided it.   I am self employed and from what you tried to pass I would have gotten NOTHING!!!!!!  It would be on then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@POTUS @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden   Want my vote? Trump is my man buy making help based on our taxes? What if behind?   Come on people, wake up, WE NEED HELP AND NOW!  #COVID19 #COVIDIOTS #COVIDActNow #PressBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader Money needs to be for all, no matter what situation we may be in, we are all in need of help.  Nothing should be based on if I paid TAXES right now.  Is it an emergency or should we just go back to our day as normal?  Just pass to send people help then worry about the rest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So when you begin to need stuff just go take it from @SpeakerPelosi and her family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thinking, why not a loan up to 5k,and we pay back at 2% interest over a period of time?  We don't all need handouts, just breathing room.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABCPolitics Wow, boasting fake news during a time like this.  I guess when someone dies they know it will become real.   And I wouldn't dare spit into the wind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @GOP @TheDemocrats   You know who has tons of medical supplies?  Russia  To bad the Dems blame everything on them.  #FridayThoughts #coronavirus #CoronavirusPandemic #Covid_19<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wsoctv   Action 9, thank you. I am also self-employed and not sure what I am going to do yet.  Hoping I don't have to get arrested and go bankrupt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @TheDemocrats @realDonaldTrump   Can y'all make a decision on HELP.  All I have heard All Week is you will be helping is who have been put out of work, and here it is Friday and nothing.  I hope I won't get a lot of time when I need to steal. At least I would have food.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWETheBump @XavierWoodsPhD Hey Vince, you have a video game, can we have a few virtual matches with Wrestlers wrestling each other.  Check out what F1 is doing, even can allow celebrities to join.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoshIsenberg4 But they built Bray wrong. Character should gave been built and made. He is no Brock or Old Goldberg, and we deserve to see they Champ fight on Smackdown.  Also, the Mandible Claw, really? Sorry but that shows @WWEBrayWyatt was rushed.  And why did he get to be unbeatable?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>let him wrestle as Bray, be bullied and beaten for a while until he has had enough and then became the Fiend.  Let's see the Fiend and Balor.  Put Braun on Smackdown and let him dominate. That we can believe. Giving Bray that power we don't buy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NBCNews And they wonder why they are Fake News.  Look how many @BarackObama fired compared to @realDonaldTrump.  So I ASSUME you are meaning this same statement for Obama.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And why no one considers the @nytimes actual news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MittRomney   Just some advice for your faith.  Do you really think God would write a book, the Bible, that you can't understand on your on? You should never need another book to understand His book.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRevAl   Bro, I know for a FACT MLKJr would have you today because you are so crooked. Wait and see what we say about you on your deathbed.  How is all the extortion working for you these days?   And please show me the word  Reverend anywhere in the Bible.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nbcsnl trying to get rating up uh?  Won't work, the damage is done.  Let's see, 8 years of Oh No @BarackObama and made no fun of him even though more material than you could ever wish.  You are not comedians, understand this, you are Political Propagandist because you bowed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThingsThatMak18 @MittRomney Ok Fairy, since a child we speak as one.  I know you are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A day you do no not do your job, hate your boss and against him and think nothing can happen to you.  A day you take an OATH and NEVER follow it.  @realDonaldTrump he needs to be court martialed.  #LtColVindmanDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN @ABC @NBCNews @CBSNews @MSNBC   Viewers,so you know these networks do not think you're stupid, they know you are.  They can't even grasp a president can fire whoever he wants.  AND @BarackObama FIRED 197 OFFICERS.  @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BernieSanders is a racist, bigot and a liar and I have PROOF.  and Bernie, please list the lies of @DonaldJTrumpJr   And not the jokes y'all DAs think are real.  Lastly Bernie, if it walks like a communist, talks like a communist, well guess what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Obamacare And Obamacare is one? Fine people 500.00 who can't afford insurance? So 500 I could have used for Dr. Bills I had to give to Obamacare.  Brilliant!   BTW @DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS can we get that money back? Sure could help with my Dr. Bills.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi   Losing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HouseDemocrats @TheDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi #ImpeachedForLife #AquittedForLife   What I've seen is Dems are Immature.  That have not learned simple life lessons.  It would have been much better for them if they would have accepted @POTUS and not gone after him. Like when Obama<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BetteMidler Loser<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pnjaban @RealJohnDennis @ScottPresler Hope he is arrested and fired. Nice caring attitude for a social worker. Imagine what he does to them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@stclairashley @AOC is a joke.  BTW AOC, still losing.  Go @realDonaldTrump   #FridayFeeling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @MittRomney And why Mitt is it ok for Hilary and the Dems to do that.  Why no condemnation for them.  Remember FAKE Russian collusion?  Only 2 possible reason,  Hates Trump or  He is hiding something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @MittRomney No such thing as coincidence. Mitt has shown he doesn't like Trump so he voted against Trump.  Mitt needs to explain what we should do when the State Dept is getting alerts on the gas company?  Which began during OBAMA, and the last time was A WEEK BEFORE THE CALL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LEGOMastersFOX   Great show.  BUT, kind of dumb to work on something for 15 hours and then have to move it across the room.  Let's see your Master Judges do that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It just hit me @realDonaldTrump   @SenatorRomney has something to hid.  Mitt, Joe Biden was VP amd is the dad of Hunter, in case you forgot.  Also, what happened in the State house a few days before the phone call.  We pay you to pay attention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @realDonaldTrump we see @SenatorRomney is truly a @TheDemocrats  Love to know what he doesn't understand, so simple a child could have followed the defense.  And @SenatorRomney after you lose, and you will, do not come back to run for President.    #ImpeachmentDay<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump #Trumpspeech  #StateOfTheUnion   @SpeakerPelosi classless. Not a lady.  Pay attention everyone.

Thanks for standing up to the bullies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDemocrats   See what y'all create and you think people being dumb will get you far.  Thank you @realDonaldTrump for revealing and can't wait for it all to come out. Drain it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffHarperArt Wow what a pie hole you are.  Russian collusion.  Do you need to read the report on how it was made up? Investigated at a cost of 32 Million?  Oh yeah, nothing to see here.  If you only knew bro what the Dems have been doing.  Just look up why Comey came to work for @BarackObama<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffHarperArt Great Satire.  Let's see, Dems blow up Trump about accepting election results then they accept them, right.  Now they can't accept their own. And who is dumb enough to use an app created 2 months ago and NEVER tested.  Been trying to overturn for 3 years. Mess? A lot better now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amyklobuchar And explain how?  Against Guns- White, Black or Hispanic is not down with that.  Abortion- Whites, Blacks or hispanics are not down with that either.  So who you got?  @realDonaldTrump is doing a GREAT job uniting us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffHarperArt Why they never learn.  What is that about repeating the same mistake and get the same results?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As I have been saying and will continue, please join along because it is Truth, and this is the best evidence. @TheDemocrats ARE LAZY. Never Ever should something be used w/o TESTING. #IowaCaucusDisaster #IowaCaucas #DNCisCorrupt   Murphy's Law people. Wow, learn from business.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True democrats, don't even believe their own elections.  Hope all those #impeachment folks notice the trend. #IowaCaucusDisaster #DNCisCorrupt #IowaCaucas #IowaCaucuses2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepLeeZeldin @Robert05705928 They have shown us all who real @TheDemocrats truly are.  And we are so thankful for @realDonaldTrump revealed it all, and mainly because @SpeakerPelosi and @RepAdamSchiff and all Dems are stupid and gullible.  Trump plays them like a pianio.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDemocrats   Keep eating the cake they feed you, and you will keep losing.  Dems are to BLAME for all the mess, their own also.  BTW, guess some missed the FACTUAL news where Dems and Media made up the Russia hoax.   To funny, you can't make this up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LivePDDave1 Wow, they cheat out in the open. Them darn @TheDemocrats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer No, we are amazed you all were to lazy @HouseDemocrats to do the job they were suppose too.  Hate people that push their work on others.  LAZY AF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnn @TheDemocrats   ROFLMAO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@parscale   Brad, Trump needs to be saying these 2 things while speaking and on commercials.  We hear crazy promises from the left.

<|startoftext|>@bennyjohnson @CNN then move there dumbass.  I'm not, to dang cold.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Jealous much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSNBC   Wow, so us informed voters know the Russian Collusion was a hoax by @TheDemocrats and you the media.  Y'all don't get it, you will never get ANYONE back as long as you keep lying.  So thanks for making it easy for @realDonaldTrump and @GOP   Keep up the lies, we see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSNBC   Hey, where we at on that box for @MikeBloomberg to stand on?  Y'all will never learn. And for entertainment please never stop falling for @POTUS tricks. Haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is called beginner business. And why politicians can never get things right.   2 key principles, one is Murphy's law, if anything can go wrong it will go wrong. The other is the Kiss principle. Keep it simple stupid.  #IowaCaucas<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer we can say the same thing about the House.   To scared or lazy to do the work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So sad this man could use that money to truly help people.  For he has NO CHANCE IN HELL at beating @realDonaldTrump   Plus doubt @TheDemocrats want him like they don't want Bernie.  To @MikeBloomberg   https://t.co/BXnPislWWH<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TomiLahren Also remember Jay z is in charge of the #HalftimeShow2020   So a standing ovation for calling out @BarackObama for putting kids in cages.  And so glad @realDonaldTrump put an end to it.   https://t.co/kN5NMkqOIw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnnysr32514 @TomiLahren I know, so glad someone took a shot at @BarackObama finally.  Maybe dems will learn we don't like kids put in cages. Thank God @DonaldJTrumpJr put an end to it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff @SpeakerPelosi   And why no one believes a word you say Adam.  And shows he knows nothing of Alaska.  Alaska worth way more than California.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If anything can go wrong, it will.  And KISS, Keep It Simple Stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fix is in against @BernieSanders lol, again  When will Bernie learn?  Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump   Want to know why all the mess @TheDemocrats #IowaCaucuses ?

<|startoftext|>@DemagoguesRUS @dcexaminer A lot of folks, for some reason developers lung cancer after they quit. Many feel when the lungs begin regrowth they over grow and become cancer. It is more in your genes than anything. Ex-114 year old Japan women smoked since she was 12.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Astartiel @dcexaminer Not sure being a smoker is Karma, think they call it science.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dcexaminer @Democrats show how much they want the country to be united. @MikeBloomberg @JoeBiden @BernieSanders these are your people. Way to show  how shallow and anti-US you are. Thanks for giving us data.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJohnDennis And I would have him arrested, this is the US, we don't do threats.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AnnCoulter Ann, some of is have known this for years.  I am in NC and ask a guy 15 years ago what happened to the recycle bin.  He said it all goes in the landfill.  One company actually had Hispanics separating the recyclables, they did but expensive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuffPost Takes this for @TheDemocrats to show who they really.  But we knew it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff  This man thinks you all are stupid.  Let's see, in Alaska is Gas, Oil and Gold.  We sell Ca before Alaska.  Not to mention DEFENSE.  SMH, ever word he says is a lie.

<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff @RepAdamSchiff proved he is a liar, snake and out for HIS own agenda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoyCooperNC @MeckCounty   We need a law.  If you release a prisoner that ICE ask to detain and the person commits another crime, the sheriff who released them should also be charged the same thing.  Sounds fair to me @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ImpeachmentHoax #Impeachment @RepAdamSchiff   What the hell does John McCain have to do with impeachment?  Just proves it is a personal agenda against @realDonaldTrump because @TheDemocrats don't like him.  Hey @TheDemocrats we don't like y'all either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeBloomberg calls everyone FAT!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteButtigieg I'd say he is the Racist.  Only racist people say others are racist.  Oldest trick in the book.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, @MikeBloomberg will unite the country.........  By being against Guns and Fat People.  Way to unite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I bet they have a law against your pet crapping in public.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dems are for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorRomney   Let's see,  So you feel it is the Senate's job to do the work the @HouseDemocrats should have done.  To spend million and months in court.  Please explain to us why?  Are you Lazy like @TheDemocrats   You see we LOVE @realDonaldTrump so we promise you are done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trisarahtop_ Jim Morrison want to be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenWarren As we see it @HouseDemocrats were to lazy to do their job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff Why did you want to do the work on the House?  Why is the senate suppose to do your HARD work.  Y'all are lazy dude.  Didn't want to so you could be done by Christmas.  But cry when Senate calls your BS.  Love it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi Same question back at you.  Why were the @HouseDemocrats so lazy and didn't want to do the work of calling witnesses?  The Senate does not need to do the work you were suppose to do.  Keep lying lazy loser.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @GOP @GOPLeader  So let's all say AHEAD OF TIME-  Ok @TheDemocrats what is next? #wewaitingdems @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer #DoNothingDemocrats  Be real nice if y'all would do some work.  @realDonaldTrump has been. #ImpeachmentHearing #SenateGOPCoverup #ImpeachmentTrialSham<|endoftext|>

Because they are LAZY!  I have finally realized, @TheDemocrats are LAZY. Done nothing for years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @GOP @SenatorRomney   Start packing your stuff bro.  We will make sure you are replaced, spoiler.  Please explain to us what ANY witness could have added?  Did you sleep through #TrumpDefenseTeam ?  I didn't. They were very easy to understand and a clear defense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a @HouseDemocrats #coverup  Want the Senate to do their HARD work, why?  Because @TheDemocrats are lazy, plain and simple, LAZY.  #DoNothingDemocrats #RIPGOP #ImpeachmentHoax #ImpeachmentTrialSham  #SenateGOPCoverup  #ImpeachmentHearing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani @Robert05705928 We know it so he can sell his book.  And when it's on the @nytimes bestseller list remember @nytimes gave Bolton a ton of free press from leaks that "they" have no problem taking. Scum.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MaryMargOlohan Glad @ewarren will bow down to LGBT but that's all. @TheDemocrats screw Blacks and Hispancis by their views on Abotion and Guns. They HATE anyone who likes @potus.  Since LGBTQ only make up .7 % of 1% of the US, who is voting for them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sbg1 Guess first time no committee 1st looked into impeachment. Or ran hearing in private basement. Or didn't allow the defense or question from the defense. Old business saying for @RepAdamSchiff "Lack of planning on your part does not make an emergency on our part."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeBloomberg   Even showing his lies in his ads.  1st he creates 30k jobs, now he is up to 1/2 million. SMH<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MikeBloomberg   Please Note,  1-Trump has gotten the US dream back. We are not America, jeez people.  2- Trump is on person to ever keep campaign promises.  So anything from anyone else is a lie.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff  @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump   So we know from Dems, when you don't answer the question then the answer is YES.  The WB did work for Biden.  Glad someone has complete amunity to cost the US 32 Million dollars. And now more on a fake account.  ALERT ALERT<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SenateGOP   Listen to Rush.   DON'T BE WEAK.  There is No Evidence to help the Dems case.  SO STOP WASTING TIME AND   OUR MONEY.  AND ALL OF YOU GET BACK TO WORK. WHAT WE PAY YOU FOR.@realDonaldTrump is the only one working and hell, he is doing FREE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hurleyj44 @TheDemocrats @realDonaldTrump Yep, him too. And in 30 years he has voted 3 times. A perfect Dem, LAZY.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenateGOP   Funny Bolton just comes up now.  Before witness I would like to know why @RepAdamSchiff didn't call him in the hearing??  Logic says if he had nothing then he has nothing now.  Do not do Sfitys work for him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenateGOP   DO NOT BOW DOWN TO DEMS   We been hearing it for 3 years and tired of it.  BOLTON IS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST, HE IS PUSHING A BOOK.   Vote and end the sham. @POTUS defense destroyed their case.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GOP   If any Republicans want witnesses they need to be gone.  I have watched it all, there is nothing ANY witness can add, #TrumpsDefense cover BOTH articles.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @FoxNews really. After we have supported yall for years.   This is a sham against @realDonaldTrump and for you to use the SCRIPT word BOMBSHELL is disgusting.  Following the crowd being a slave. Be creative and write your own script.<|endoftext|>

I cannot remember the last time an actual news organization broke a major investigation or cover up.   Just puppets. That's who most of you lost your own freedom from.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer   Chuck, you need to ask @SpeakerPelosi and @RepAdamSmith why THEY DIDN'T CALL THE WITNESSES?  Also, all we have heard is your evidence is overwhelming.  Please see the NO logic of @HouseDemocrats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justinamash All anyone needs to read to know this person is dumb.  Can you understand what the House did? And WHY didn't they do it?  Ask yourself that question dumb-A.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Mexico is not going to let that happen. Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wis10 never knew a channel that hated ratings.  Let's see, CBS, ABC &amp; Fox have extra channels. But your station is the ONLY one that shows the EXACT same news on 2 channels.  People can see both of these channels via Air and sure Cable.  So why? Makes no sense for news on 10.2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AinsworthKeith @taylorswift13 good, then she should also give 70% of everything she makes to the govenment.  That is the Dems plan Taylor. That happens you will never be able to get your music from Scooter. SMH, loses songs to a guy named Scooter, lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN @ABC @MSNBC @CBSNews @NBCNews   Pretty obvious when ALL of you use the EXACT same script.  Crack? Copious?  This is another problem with Left and their Media, they are LAZY. Can't even write a script in their own words. Just take what Dems give you and read it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RepDanCrenshaw @GOPLeader Glad to hear, but everyone has dumb logic on climate change.  We have had a solar flare hit the earth before. What is the plan when it happens again?

<|startoftext|>@AMarch4OurLives But I know a few from Pills and a few from Cars and even Stairs. So some of us get confused on the logic?  Sort of like when I was a kid I really thought quicksand would be part of my life.  #IStandWithVirginia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AMarch4OurLives Still waiting for Car Control, cars Kill more, you know since it's the gun. And damn those stairs, they kill more than anything. And we need to get the people you age off the pills. That kills way way more than guns. So why are guns top priority? I know no one killed by a gun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AMarch4OurLives I will make a promise. The day you take away a RIGHT given by God,  you will be invaded and taken over. Why do you think we have never been invaded?

<|startoftext|>@Reuters @GretaThunberg So sad you dad and the guy in India are idots.  So much research against it, like Ice Cores.  Funny 80s there was a book called Pole Shift.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBSNews Fake news. Her dad and the guy in India, TWO MEN, who run her account and life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArguingWIdiots @CNN @realDonaldTrump And glad to see you see how losing has brain washed you to hate a man and the people who voted for him. Job well done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArguingWIdiots @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @TheDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi It is when you are just saying with no facts for your bulling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArguingWIdiots @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @TheDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi See, there it is, so actions require being a bully.  Thats what's wrong with y'all. It's called higher ground, dems never take, Rep use to but no more.  Never a reason to resort to that unless your a bully.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArguingWIdiots @CNN @realDonaldTrump And I gave Dems a theme song, not sure why they don't use it.   https://t.co/OWpNmmrp9x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patriot_melissa @Robert05705928 @realDonaldTrump Agree, but Charlotte NC? Right? And yeah, dems run the city of Charlotte.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArguingWIdiots @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @TheDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS We see you losing everyday. Nothing confusing. And we love it soooooooo much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArguingWIdiots @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @TheDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi I was, no reason now, you got a sane party and a insane party.  Thet showed their true colors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArguingWIdiots @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @TheDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi Hahaha, 2 of 2, I'm rolling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArguingWIdiots @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @TheDemocrats Bro, you do no research. Ya see this report came out and showed it was a scheme of Democrats. That is facts. Try again.   Still losing too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArguingWIdiots @CNN @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @RepAdamSchiff Yep, I was right.  So paraphrasing is what you call it. Wow, you just work for him. Look that up whole you at it and see the great paraphrasing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArguingWIdiots @CNN @realDonaldTrump Wow, even delusional you think you have an audience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArguingWIdiots @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @TheDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi Wow, same with you. Dude, I'm not your bitch. I'm a independent who hates bullies. And that is all I see and have seen. You can do something I did, but I'm not biased and suck up to a party of racism and lynching. And use same tactics they used then. I'm from the south, saw it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArguingWIdiots @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @TheDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi Yep, I agree, you all lost in 2016 and every trick Dems tried has backfired and lost.  Losing sucks. Glad @POTUS is winning.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ArguingWIdiots @CNN @realDonaldTrump Wow, disillusioned too. Dems been doing Day 1, just like they did to the blacks in the day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArguingWIdiots @CNN @realDonaldTrump @POTUS You bringing up hearsay like @RepAdamSchiff version of the phone call. Great fake news though to make Dems look stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArguingWIdiots @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @TheDemocrats Sure ya did. Why you believe in russian collusion and the tooth fairy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArguingWIdiots @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @TheDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi Lol it's Russia again, oh lord. Y'all need a new line, you can only cry wolf so many times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArguingWIdiots @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @TheDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi I read way to much, and glad you know what I do. Dang like Dems knowing what Trump thinks. Awesome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdrianNormanDC I said the same thing. This should be illegeal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>to protect the constitution and bill of Rights.  Don't think we will allow you do continue this sham. It will happen, not a prediction, a spoiler. We are for @POTUS we voted for him and are behind him. We didn't like Obama, but we are adults.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats @GOP @SpeakerPelosi  I wonder if the Dems realize how close they are coming to being removed by force, By The People, the Police and Military. If they continue taking away rights given us by God, we will take them out and make sure we have folks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattgaetz Sure would like to know where the money came from.  The govenment stealing money needs to stop. When you can run for office, drop out and then use the money to pay your relative should be illegal.  Why do college Athletes get hell if they do anything wrong.  This is bull.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewPollackFL People need to learn there is something a lot of people talk about is Hate Cancer or Hate Sickness.  When you hate like this you will become sick.

<|startoftext|>@PPFA @PPact  @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr @McConnellPress   What the hell y'all?  How can they give Money to the democrats when 1/3 of their money comes from taxpayers.  Oh hell no, this should be against the law and will be stopped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedcruz Wait, do they get Federal Funding?  If so is this not illegal?  How do you get money from a bipartisan govenment and turn around and give to one party?  WTH man?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump @POTUS   President Truml, please someone begins addressing this.  Why are college athletes not allowed to be paid, but a Politician can get their selves and family and friends high paying jobs they are not qualified to do?  This is not fair to the Athletes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to know WHY @ABC @CBSNews @NBCNews @CNN still continues to LIE to our faces.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArguingWIdiots @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @TheDemocrats Snowflakes hate to lose.  Still losing!  Everything Dems do blows up in their face.  What do you need to know about Iran, that we not giving them BILLIONS anymore. Send them your own cash.  BTW, I chat with those in Iran, they LOVE Trump and HATE @SpeakerPelosi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArguingWIdiots @CNN @realDonaldTrump Won't because you can't admit it to yourself like the Dems.  Face it, all spoiled brat racist bullies who can't stand losing.  We who voted for Trump felt same way about Obama as y'all do Trump, but we are adults, not adults with minds of children, for that's how they act.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArguingWIdiots @CNN @realDonaldTrump Facts like the Dems bring? We still waiting on ANY evidence @POTUS did anything wrong.  Unemployment at an all time low in 60 years.  More jobs than people to fill them.  And the day a democrat is elected, biggest stock market fall in history.  Google everything Trump's done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArguingWIdiots @CNN @realDonaldTrump And you from CNN, what about MSNBC next?   When you lose a lawsuit for fake news you are fake news.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump thank you for working so hard and getting things done. We know the #DoNothingDemocrats will not. Like @SpeakerPelosi @RepAdamSchiff @TheDemocrats   BTW, Nancy saying impeached, well we the people paid a lot for her to say that.  But, to be Impeached is to be gone<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NCAAFootball @NCAA @espn   Since Colleges are STATE RAN, it should be illegal for the game not to be on Public TV, FREE for ALL!  Not Pay for View via Cable.  Can @realDonaldTrump fix this?  Can we get a class action lawsuit?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @TheDemocrats @HouseDemocrats #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica  #impeachment #NancyPelosi #NancyPelosiFakeNew  When the Iraian people see who Nancy really is then seems time to step aside.

<|startoftext|>@HouseGOP @GOPLeader So funny comments on here screaming Rep won't give a fair trail.  What the hell do y'all call what Dems did with the hearing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSanders   This is what you want. So by logic looking at his history in govenment, he will do nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MidEastWitness @soleimali We never want violence but we do have many crazy people and we do have our guns. It is a price we pay but we also have the ability to makes bombs with items in our house. Sadly Drugs kill more US people than anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MidEastWitness @soleimali Just a fun fact for you. Last year in One US State, 600K got hunting permits. Those 600k went in the woods to hunt and not one person was shot. This would be the 7th largest army in the world. When you add ALL states hunters for last year would make the largest army in the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano   Wait, what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSmith Fair Trail? Wait, what? When did this begin, should have been a FAIR hearing first.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You know @CNN hates it when the TRUTH is told.   Meanwhile @TheDemocrats morn the loss of a terrorist.  Wonder why @BarackObama could for @SpeakerPelosi but @realDonaldTrump can't.  And they think we don't see this. Like history has been erased.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano You realize you show your education level? Which is low.  Aly, they said if NOT SENT WITHIN 25 DAYS, therefore putting a time limit on it. That is fair. Nancy said this was an emergency, what happened.  Nothing was shifted to Iran, Nancy was done before Christmas. What happened?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi   We are not Stupid like you and yours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackieSpeier @CNN @wolfblitzer   Hey IDOTS, IT'S 2020. Our tech is so good we saw the plane shot down.  This is NO TECH on Iran.  Guess they should have used the 150 Billion better.

<|startoftext|>@ewarren   What is the percentage of Carbon in our atmosphere?  How much Carbon was in our atmosphere during the last ice age, when no humans were around?  If you can't answer these 2 questions you have no business talking about climate. #ClimateCrisis #ClimateEmergency<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>150 billion devided by 300 million is 500.00 per person.   Let that sink in, 500 of your money to Iran.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ewarren @TheDemocrats @realDonaldTrump   We know and seen by the actions of Trump, the Democrats LIE every election and never keep their promises.  So this is fake talk so she hopes to get votes.  @POTUS said what he was going to do and did it.  Democrats have NEVER done that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi   So let's get this Straight.  You and Dems can do an unfair hearing and fake.  But Republicans can't.  All we need to know Nancy.  You will get what you gave, NOTHING. #impeachment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ThursdayThoughts   https://t.co/37LqOnKzd0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @SpeakerPelosi @GOP   I am pissed!!!!!!!!  150 Billion Dollars devided by 300 million is what?  So every person in the USA gave Iran 500.00+. Plus because not all 300 million work.  WTH Obama. I don't have that kind of money bro. Can we get a refund?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArguingWIdiots @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Obama was stupid. To give Iran any money was stupid. To make a deal with them was stupid. To not stand up to them was stupid.  @TheDemocrats are stupid and they need another Slave bad. Same Dem party I grew up with in the south. So believe their lies, we don't no more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomSteyer No Tom, and thank God a coward like you is not in office.  How many americans have been killed due to Iran?  And all because YOUR party, your Slave Obama, gave them BILLIONS!!!!  Real smart Tom, and you getting so many likes, lmao. @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Losers #IvotedforHillaryClinton<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Obama committed TREASON.  Dems want same.  Dems want to control @realDonaldTrump so that means they did control Obama.  @BarackObama was the white power Dem's slave.   Same party they have always been. #TrumpSpeech<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jodyvance @IsraelUSAforevr We don't draft. Why would we need to with our technology. It's 2020. Google our robot soliders in the works. And let's see, took a week or so in Iraq, and Iraq use to whoop Iran in conflicts. BTW, We spend 10x what Russia does on military, China is 3rd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@s_eskandari97 We were told by a General.  At Area 51 we have technology 50 years beyond anything you can imagine.  We have jets that can out run your missiles.  You do know we spend 10x on our Military than Russia does.   If Iran wants some, we promise someone else will raise your kids.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soleimali We know, we get the truth of what's going on there, it is sad, the Iran people deserves to be more. Freedom is worth it, to be free to say what you want is worth dying for. No matter if we agree or not with what they say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fatemeh33444554 Me Tarzan, you Jane.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@POTUS @IraqiSecurity   We respect the request of Iraq.  @realDonaldTrump please make sure we don't give them a dime. It would be a waste of money since once we are gone ISIS will line them up and shoot them.  Also they need to pay for training.  Could've been Japan, Germany, NK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How do you fire 15 missiles and not kill anyone with today's technology. By doing on purpose, that's how.  Iran knows better but they still messed up, guess they want to be even more broke. #IranAttacks #IranVSAmerica<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BarackObama was a SLAVE to the white @TheDemocrats.  It dawned on me how Dems want to control @realDonaldTrump that they did control Obama. Making him not the first black president, but first Slave Dems put in office.  Upon seeing and hearing Dems they ran all over him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@POTUS @IraqiGovt @realDonaldTrump   I hope us pulling all troops from Iraq also means we will no longer give them money.  Not our problem if they all wish to die at the hands of ISIS.  #Nomoneyforiraq  #IraqProtests<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer Please point out exactly where Ukraine's money was delayed under @POTUS we know it was under Obama.  Glad you are not in charge, and sounds to me you need to send it back to @SpeakerPelosi so they can do a FAIR AND UNBIASED hearing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KarlSpicyweiner @ChrisWarmuth @HouseDemocrats Dems and UN push climate control for money.  If they cared there would be a plan for things that have happened.

<|startoftext|>Everything must be logical and this is not. Why?  A lot of governments have experimented with the weather. But will not tell us.

<|startoftext|>If there is climate issues, which they are not, (research Ice Cores and the weather history it shows) then it has been caused by governments around the world for experimenting on the weather.  This this is a theory. Google Treaty to not use weather control during War.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GretaThunberg @TIME   To every #ClimateCrisis person.  All below happened. Where is the plan?  Volcano eruption that blocks the Sun for a year.  A solar flare hits the earth and takes out ALL electronics.  What experiments have been done on the weather by ALL nations?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Anyone upset with Trump on this is SICK!  This girl is Special Needs. Know anyone with Special Needs? I can have 100 tomorrow against the climate hoax. They win people of the year? This would not happen in the US, thank God. We protect those with disabilities. WORST PARENTS EVER.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Tweet2MAGA Not only a child but a special needs child, 10x worse. She is abused and in US they would be investigated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DMNCBIRD @DeanObeidallah @nedglover100 @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @GretaThunberg has been made a public figure by her bully parents.  She is special needs. In the US we protect them and her parents would be investigated by DHS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisLutolf @AndyOstroy @DrTomMartinPhD @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @MELANIATRUMP @ThatSteveSack Her parents are the bullies. She is special needs.  In US we protect them and these parents would be investigated for abuse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyOstroy @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS She is being bullied by her parents.  If this girl was a US citizen DHS would investigate.  I would report them or any person FORCING their beliefs on someone who is special needs.  In the US we protect them.  Guy I work with was big Dem for who worked with him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyOstroy @realDonaldTrump @GretaThunberg SMH, if someone who was against Climate change was her parents then that's what she would be for.  None of you get this is Abuse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More folks who can't think. Greta is a public figure. Baron is not. DA  FYI, it is never right to push YOUR agenda on someone who is Special Needs.  In the US you can be charged with Abuse for doing what @GretaThunberg parent's have done. I see how they can be influenced each day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Love how everyone applauds the parents of a SPECIAL NEEDS girl.  Do any of you know anything about Specail Needs?  You can train them to think how you want them too.   But that is wrong, they DESERVE choices.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GretaThunberg is a public figure like her parents wanted her to be.  Dems are so dumb, she, bottom line, is child abuse on a special needs girl.  She has been programmed by her parents, no normal childhood. And all you racist spoiled brat bullies applaud them. SMH. SN is my life<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Still not one piece of evidence. Come on paid Dem staff tweeting. We just one ONE fact. So far after how many weeks there is nothing but wasting time, money and losing Dem votes because people are not that stupid.   #ImpeachingHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BuckyIsotope @realDonaldTrump Who tried to fix the election. Wonder why dems got panties in a was over Ukraine. Also article appeared in NYT. So informed, unless Dems don't want you to know.   https://t.co/V5Xz8MsIq6<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BuckyIsotope @realDonaldTrump Nope, list it. Like dems, saying it doesn't make it true. If ifs and buts were candy and nuts.    If @SpeakerPelosi doesn't have anything how can anyone else. That's per her on @CNN.  Here is what their evidence is like.  I think all the Democrats are pedophiles. That's evidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahaha  Look at all the soon to be disappointed losers for the .... time. We have lost count. And lots of fooled SLAVES for Dems.  How do you all explain the shift to @POTUS over these hearing. Normal We The People see clearly what Dems are up to. Let down again. #ImpeachmentDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And like the Democrats the tweets are the same, saying the Republicans are doing what actually the Dems are doing. I feel 80% posting are paid by the Dems because they say the EXACT same thing.  #ImpeachingHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is so funny reading these hashtags.  It's like seeing someone get excited for a christmas gift they will never get and will be let down. Dems have them owned.

<|startoftext|>@NatSecLisa   Sure ALL THIS MATTERS TO YOUR KIDS. Sad you ruin their lives and you only care because you are being mocked.  YOU NEED TO BE MOCKED. Your children and your spouse should be most important to you, but to hell with them, uh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ifuaskmee We don't need 3 states picking presidents. It is for ALL states. To think popular wins is very odd, seems no sense of why it was made.

<|startoftext|>@TODAYshow This is America, cheat on husband and children and blame others so you're a victim.

<|startoftext|>@thedailybeast @MollyJongFast I hope all realize this could be a psychopath.  She CARES NOTHING FOR HER KIDS.

Your kids are the victims.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NatSecLisa Unlike while you were cheating? Lady you put yourself in this, ONLY YOU.  You decided to lie cheat and steal, then tried to cover it up.

Hypocritical much?  You messed up, with Hillary you got us ALL involved. And now we will not be passive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff #ImpeachmentSham #ImpeachAndRemove   Witness asked: Are you aware of collision between Ukraine and Hillary?  Schiff stops and tells witness they don't have to answer.

<|startoftext|>@GOP @TheDemocrats @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi @nbcsnl   Watching the Dems in all this #impeachment stuff is better than any skit on SNL in years. Lol, "I heard from a guy that heard from a guy that was told by another guy."  SNL need to bring back the Lawyer who smoked, that's them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Each lie will come back on you. You see how they work so good in your personal life, it's no different for life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCNews did you see over 250k Scientists want Nancy Pelosi #impeached? Yeah, they signed up on some website. Which makes them scientists, right? I always wonder how it feels to be seen as so dumb by so many, and that will be your legacy. Wow, so not worth it to lie. And believe,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevinSLeahy @BryanSteil go follow this Rep. Others were tweeting about today upset Nancy cancelled work due to seeing the fraud inquiry.

<|startoftext|>@JoeCunninghamSC @SpeakerPelosi @JimClyburnSC Folks, this is SC calling, and the President, who We The People elected, has put something very important in front of you.

<|startoftext|>@KevinSLeahy That's even funnier. All the while @TheDemocrats refuse to work and sign Rx low prices.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ImpeachmentHearings #ImpeachTrump   @TheDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump   Wake up US, here is what EVERYONE has been asking for, and your Democrats refuse to do any work and take meeting rooms for real work.  NO LOW RX PRICES FOR ANYONE.  THANKS @TheDemocrats<|endoftext|>

So much comedy, and you can't make this up.  Hey Tweeters, where is all this evidence? Lied again.  Anyone?  LMAO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi #ImpeachTrump #ImpeachmentHearings   This must be what Dems want, people who do no work but get paid very well by us. We The People need to see this, work to be done but they want to waste our money on a hoax.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Impeach #ImpeachmentHearing #impeachment #ImpeachTrump   I would watch if it was about how the @TheDemocrats made up a phone Russia investigation.   We know how all this happened. @RepAdamSchiff met with the Whistleblower and gave him the story and his lawyer to contact. Made up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@POTUS @TheDemocrats @RepAdamSchiff @SpeakerPelosi sure hope one day we will here all this evidence that is overwhelming. All we see is a group of bullies who are upset they been left out. Maybe if they did some work things would be better. Just pay attention Dems to #WalkAway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff told them they would not be allowed. Some folks miss this part. Republicans have No say. Funny uh? One day it will happen to all of you or your children. Bulling at its definition so F all that want to stop bullies, @TheDemocrats don't give a F.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ha, @SpeakerPelosi and gang ain't doing any work. They haven't for 3 years, why would they start now. You seen how concerned all those Ca Reps are concerned about those fires. They rather run fake investigation than help their own state. #ImpeachmentHearing @TheDemocrats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ImpeachTrump Dems are so dumb. This whole thing is their personal opinion and mainly because they were not included on decisions @POTUS made. Dumb for that's their own fault. Trump tried to work with them but they only wanted to spy and lie. Some of them needs to be charged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi needs to pay attention to #WalkAway which tends everyday.  Dems have lost touch with everyone.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Friday, @ABC reported Trump thinks hearings shouldn't be in public.

<|startoftext|>@DineshDSouza @Tweet2MAGA @kimcooks4judge The boy needs to hit puberty first. Game changes then, ask the girl that wanted to be a boy and parents encouraged, then she hit puberty and now she is all girl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#climateactionp according to science earth has been here 4 billion years, so we damaged in the last 100? And during that last ice age how did Carbon levels get so high, we not here. &amp; ice cores which shows thousands of years of weather shows:Climate changes and sometimes rapidly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#climateactionp  Stop scaring people and children with your lies. This is a hoax for money grab. Takes very little research to disprove. Example During the last ice age carbon levels were 10 times higher than they are today. How is that possible? Carbon is .04% of our air. Fools.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're a Democrat you have no right to use this word or make a comment about this word. You are the evil that did that to black people. So sit down and shut up.  And minorities if your with the democrats that's on you. We know history. #Lynching<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDemocrats @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi @GOP Democrats calling out a Republican on using the word #Lynching is gold. Wonder how many democrat ancestors lynched black people for it is the same party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TexasJoeDuck @TheDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Please list all the crimes here. We would love to see them. And we will start listening the crimes all democrats have done. That would be a long list.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is vile is to know the same party that did the lynching is still in power and blacks cuddle with them.  And I didn't know the loyalist from England that were lynched for being only loyal were black. Or all those horse thieves in the wild West @GOP @POTUS #Lynching<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Goes to show you people are not as bright and you would think. They have forgotten their history altogether. The wild West didn't exist. War did not exist. Only black people were hung. And BYW if that were true it would be because of democrats, they did the lynching. #Lynching<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader yo bro, Dems Lynched back in the Daytona blacks. More whites lynched for stealing horses.  So my question to you is why didn't you bring any other this up? Coward. Bow down you little B.@POTUS thank you Trump for being real and not fake like others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh yea, who did most of the lynching on Blacks. Hahaha, y'all stupid. @TheDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi #Lynching<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS #Lynching understand no matter who is President, we VOTED for him. So if you want to use your power and the US government to get rid of our president, who is doing a great job unlike Obama. If this happens it will mean war. Govt. for the people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN @ABC @CBSNews @NBCNews @TheDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi You all think your lies are making any ground? Not of you look at your ratings. Reruns of Seinfeld beat y'all. Wrestling beats y'all. But what beats all of them? @FoxNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN LMAO, when you go after people, especially the best President in the history of the US, people will come after you. So fun seeing you are what we say and think you are. BTW, Trump @POTUS is Clean. He has showed you he is not dumb, so you think he will mess up. Ha, good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@POTUS @TheDemocrats @GOP @cnn @CBSNews @FoxNews @ABC @NBCNews Here is a story for you. WHY IS ELECTRICITY A FOR PROFIT COMPANY IN THE USA. IT IS A UTILITY!!!!!!!!! I imagine this had something to do with evil Edison.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi They will lose everything and thank God. They devide the country, are bigots and hate the US. There dream is to make us like China. SLAVES! No freedom, no advance. Remember Obama told us these days of growth were over. Why?  https://t.co/BvmhO3KoYv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SLAVES SLAVES SLAVES. PAY ATTENTION. This is what the Dems want from you. They want YOU to be totally dependent on them. Look at economy under Obama. He could have done what Trump has done. Why didn't he? They want US to be their slaves. .70 of every dollar, you a slave.#Lynching<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad lynching only happened to black people. All those poor men that stole horses, or accused of being a witch, or killing someone. See, @TheDemocrats make it all about their agenda, which is We The People have nothing and are SLAVES to them. This is what you want? #Lynching<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveScalise @RepAndyBiggsAZ They want to make it obvious then. Liars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Y'all people are so dumb and it shows. I will bet ANYONE more whites have been lynched than blacks. Um, horse stealing was lynching on site. Then the golden days, the witch days. Love though you make it all about one group. Wake up. @SpeakerPelosi  @TheDemocrats Impeach for war.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC what you and Bernie nor the Dems get is "we ain't asking nobody for nothing, if we can't get it on our own. If you don't like the way I'm living then just leave this country boy alone." Also "A country boy will survive." BTW, the "Uhs and Ums",just dont say them, that simple<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NFL @Panthers Thinking about the low % of successful On-Side Kicks. Has anyone ever practiced or tried to kick a line drive into another player. There would be no way anyone could handle it, and your team could focus on the guy getting drilled by the ball. Never seen it done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @TheDemocrats there goes Fla vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC @SpeakerPelosi Why are you all saying Tulsi is a Russian. Explains a lot, you feel you have found a LIE that works. It doesn't. Dems can't let Russian stuff go, even going after their own. And @TulsiGabbard should expose all of you. See Dems, it could be you or your children<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC @SpeakerPelosi um the money had been going to Ukraine way before @POTUS phone call with them. Nice try liars. I wonder what you hope to achieve. Because you all would truly be the ones that definitely don't want what you think you do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Straight out lie to dumb people. Google it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HillaryClinton What drugs you taking. You lost because we the people have had enough. And now only getting worse. And why stay a Dem when your own party says you are with Russia. If that's so then we know who is trying to collude with russia.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LacyJohnsonMN @IlhanMN Swamp draining good. This is typical. @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 @LindseyGrahamSC I have a troubling theory seeing how the Dems really are, I would not put it past them to take a young Dem and tell him to pretend to be Republican while they support him in campaigns. So we have Dems disguised as Rep. now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>See @SpeakerPelosi @TheDemocrats @POTUS Hard to keep the lies straight, uh Dems? #impeachment  https://t.co/ZQea3E5Nns<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would hate to be following @TheDemocrats they do no work, and constantly getting your  hopes up and letting you down again and again. Thank you @POTUS for being honest and keeping your promises. Better than all the lies from the left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ClimateChange all of you so concerned then push the US in where is Tesla's work. They took it when he died, broke and alone. He was able to get FREE electricity from the earth and send through the air. Wonder why @TheDemocrats would hide this. Dems are the let down party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump We now know the Russians are Cloud Strike. Thank You President Trump for revealing these evil people. Same kinda people that did same to Tesla(Edison) and if left alone @TheDemocrats we would have FREE electricity from the earth, not coal. But y'all against #ClimateChange.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@POTUS @SpeakerPelosi If Trump cured Cancer the @TheDemocrats would have a problem with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maddow BTW, don't even mention the Kurds were fighting Syria not that long ago. Been fighting Turkey forever. AND DON'T FORGET SYRIA USED CHEMICAL WEAPONS MORE THAN ONCE ON THEIR OWN PEOPLE. Y'all pay attention, Dems never want war, my whole life, now they do? Uh? SMH @POTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maddow You a genius. Wish the Kurds had other areas to go to, so sad. Folks, they are the largest group of muslims with no home. They are spread all over. Remember they helped us in Iraq and been there for years. They fought the Russians. This lady act like they new with nowhere 2go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @VP @SecPompeo @RTErdogan This is President Trump saying to the @TheDemocrats "Hold my beer, and watch this." They wanted no part in it so no credit to the dems for this at all, and a lot of Republicans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @VP @SecPompeo @RTErdogan Thank you so much for working hard for US. We voted for you and growing larger everyday. If @TheDemocrats and @SpeakerPelosi don't wake up soon and do some work they will be watching at home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, she sure does, LMAO, he already worked a deal with Turkey. The man is to smart for y'all.@POTUS #PelosiOwnsTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @SpeakerPelosi &amp; @TheDemocrats y'all still taking some stupid step about your buddy Assad? Who uses chemical weapons. No worry, @POTUS is working, you all not, and has it solved. He is so smarter than all of you put together. See what happens when you work for the good of USA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @POTUS Nancy, please explain why we should fight for Syria, Iran &amp; Russia? The Kurds have been fighting for 50 years, and are all over that region. The Kurds want their own country, but you have never stated that. So IS soliders should die fighting for Syria. Good1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NancyOwnsTrump #PelosiMeltdown @SpeakerPelosi @Potus The Dems and Nancy have done no work in 3 years, especially if working with our Leader, who we ELECTED. So why would they start now. If from my state I'd be telling them to get to effing work you lazy liars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump owns the Dem party. Mainly 2 reasons. One he is smarter than all of you. Two, he is clean. Do pray for Nancy and and the Dems, things about to get bad for them. Collusion fake story and now the elections. Don't believe me? Google Results for Louisiana Vote. #PelosiOwnsTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahaha, let's see. Number of times Trump has lied to us.  0.   Where the Dems and media is one lie after another. So from all I see and hear, Nancy would hands down be the bully. Has been for 3 years. And of course they left, they don't work like you and I do. #PelosiOwnsTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi Hope you understand, you are making no ground against our @POTUS what you are doing is digging a deeper hole. Should have gone along and worked with Trump and been the good guy, but you all can't because of pride, spoiled rich and bullies. @CNN @ABC @CBSNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @CNN @ABC @NBCNews @CBSNews Do you really think we believe anything you tell us? @POTUS has not lied to us once, you all do it every day. Nancy still lying about collusion. You and Obama made that crap up, and about to be known.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepThomasMassie @realDonaldTrump Please ask them, so we are suppose to fight for Syria, Russia and Iran. Dems are so dumb it's not even funny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer glad you willing to work. See something else you all miss. We the people have jobs, and like him or not you have to grin and bear it and work with him. We have to do this in our jobs, we can't walk out. But you haven't worked in 3 years, guess hard to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump That look right there is why @SpeakerPelosi and Dems will lose big. Dems are spoiled brats and bullies. Just look at them, bully everyone to get what they want. Dems, we hate bullies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi ROFL<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @TheDemocrats Please keep doing what you are doing, it's working great for the GOP. Just because your news doesn't cover doesn't make it not true. And this is a shadow of what's to come for what you all have done to @POTUS   https://t.co/ZV3g1zqYUc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At the 25 year mark they begin to give up freedoms and where we are today. It is very sad, but they made their choice and they can't fight China. They will be re-educated, as the gays and Christians and Muslims. BUT, the people of China ARE SLAVES bro. @KingJames<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's give some education and what LJ should have said. "It's a terrible thing for the freedom fighters but it is for no use. They will lose and Hong Kong will be China. Why?

<|startoftext|>@BrooklynNets your owner think we in USA are dumb, that no one has ever been to China. People in China only learn what the govt wants them too.

<|startoftext|>@KingJames And to think, the 2 Billion people in China know nothing of this tweet or the debate we are having. Why? BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED. MOVE THERE AND SEE HOW YOU FEEL.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Oh yeah @FoxNews, I randomly called 5000k people and ask what they thought about impeachment. 88.7% say they know it's another fake story by the Dems. 93% Happy with the economy and jobs.

<|startoftext|>@ewarren And must not pretend we are one of them. BTW, Euorpeans found Americas, notice the S, not us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ewarren Trump already has done this and you all are doing your best to take it back from the people. You don't care what the people think, as in we VOTED for @POTUS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews YOU POLLED 1000 PEOPLE? What a freaking joke. I'm sure if you ask us to call with our thoughts it would be way more than 1000. Why not ask then tens of thousands at Trump's rally  Stupid stuff like this will drop your ratings. Finally topped Raw. https://t.co/CH77dtPm3u<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews Question: Why don't you poll all of us in the rural areas when doing a poll. I live in the south and NO ONE supports impeachment and NO ONE is going to. We are not dumb Fox News. We see what is going on and you use to also, so what happened? Craps fake and illegal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDemocrats @LibDems Wow, I been fired, can I get help from you crybabies? @POTUS can fire whoever he wants when he wants for no reason at all.

<|startoftext|>@WWE R-Truth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @TheDemocrats Hahahahaha, and if anyone was spreading hate it was the players. BTW, where are they now?

<|startoftext|>@NBA @ESPNNBA Hey, what is going on, you refused to come to NC b/c no bathrooms for trans. So they have them in China? NO b/c it's not allowed.

<|startoftext|>@CityMinneapolis so the state passed a green law that makes no difference at all. Cops run their engines, Trucks, construction equipment, cold people all run their cars.

<|startoftext|>@WWE @MsCharlotteWWE @itsBayleyWWE So no more rematches uh? How can we apply for writing jobs at WWE. Been a fam since a small boy and I can write a lot better stories than whoever they have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@POTUS @SpeakerPelosi #SchiffForBrains when you do your impeachment crap behind closed doors that says it all. And what the Dems did after the Trump rally says it all. Violent   cheating liars. &amp; can't side with China and #LGBT. Hope LGBT notices this, comes to money, you gone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBA @ESPNNBA Stopped watching going to games when they forced NC hands over bathrooms. They were high and mighty. Now look, they and @TheDemocrats are supporting China over Freedom. China where you can't be gay. So no NC support and now dumping @LGBTProgress for China. SMH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This lady is either losing it or she is going to become a comedian.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump We already have the truth. Dems lie and make stuff up to try and win elections since you can't do it on your own. None of you and that is funny. BTW things are so great even Obama brought a house on the beach during @POTUS leading. Now that's funny, didn't even buy under himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump You want to work on something, work on getting the Kurds their on land. They deserve it and would be our best allie in that region.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump What did y'all do in China, Ukraine,  Russia, Germany, England. Do I need to go on? So hey lets make up some more stuff. Nancy hates kids. Dems want to make Slaves out of the US. Nancy kills baby seals and it needs to stop. These are what I will share. What can you make up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @RepLBR @HouseDemocrats Wouldn't be soaring if instead of trying to overturn an election for @POTUS that we voted for our President, you would have worked, like he has, instead of making fake stories up to try and steal it. Again, you have done NOTHING for 3 YEARS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi Hahahaha, oh no they don't.  You mean the liberal judges obama put in place? That's why we have a supreme court Nancy. If what you say is true then we should have no supreme court, lower courts should be right. God you think US citizens are stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Wow, 50 troops make a world of difference. And also the Kurd have been doing most of the fighting and can do fine. Trump will hit them where it hurts. Also, do you mean like y'all promised Ukraine help if they did away with their military. And then you didn't  help them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi Let's see, Biden ask for help, Obama did same with Russia, Carter did it and so on. Keep telling lies, thing about lies, they come out. And BTW, we read the phone call so mo ot sure what you are talking about. He didn't. Soooooooo.............<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @HouseDemocrats @realDonaldTrump Oh, that's why we have jobs, better pay, great economy. I would say with all that evidence it is Dems who have waged war on workers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Post the letter DJT sent y'all on why they will not aid. Suspicious you hiding that too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Hey Nancy, where is your transparency? Why is everything y'all are doing is behind closed doors. Sounds suspicious. We already know AS is making this all up, so why should they star in your play. You made the play and it is backfiring so bad,which is good. Black vote is go gone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @senatemajldr Why? You have done no work in 3 years, why start now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWENetwork @WWE pretty disappointed to see JR on the other wrestling. Thought he retired? And y'all force on us the crap we have to listen to each show. Thank God King is back. WWE, your announcers are horrible. Sometimes watch with no sound. Announcers make or break the show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDemocrats @POTUS The reason President Trump is in office is because of exactly what Democrats are doing now and have been doing. So keep making our point. We will get more of you out of office. #impeachment #FakeNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry, but it is old school, which means you don't come on the scene and win the title. Hate to say it but the Fiend must take some a-whopping before he deserves the belt. You don't get the belt because yo uh came up with a cool character.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShawnDr37293160 He has a wife you know. Hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDemocrats @HouseGOP We are keeping a tally and we will be going against you on social media if you are one of those trying to impeach on a bunch of fake crap. So bye bye easy job.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wwe all those crying about the last match it had to end that way. Take it from life long fan, the  Fiend has done nothing to deserve the belt, all he has done is show up.

<|startoftext|>@peterson_hoyt @DJ_BV1988 @BryanDawsonUSA @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews What<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peterson_hoyt @DJ_BV1988 @BryanDawsonUSA @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews And how does the east side of your state do. We are not stupid, wow, the coast has money. The east side of state don't. Worst illiteracy and drop out rates in the country. Worst housing and schools. Ca us doing a great job for everyone. And those Dems care about the poor. SMH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peterson_hoyt @DJ_BV1988 @BryanDawsonUSA @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @POTUS Dems want to control EVERY ASPECT of your life. Fact. Look at the laws and policies and taxes and fees. No freedom. Slaves to government. Never heard that from anyone else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peterson_hoyt @DJ_BV1988 @BryanDawsonUSA @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews You have 1/3 of all people on welfare. Today. CA more than 1 out of every 3 people are on welfare. This month, CBS, CA fastest rising poverty in the country. How is this if so great. Taxation without representation. Like the dems want, people poor and govt wealthy. Again, slaves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peterson_hoyt @DJ_BV1988 @BryanDawsonUSA @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Sounds like such a wonderful place.   https://t.co/iYgDI4QlTz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peterson_hoyt @DJ_BV1988 @BryanDawsonUSA @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews I have one perspective to the govenment, leave me alone, get out of my business, protect !my country, help the poor and needy. But some of that is on me. Other than that you on your own. I moved out of my parents house a long time ago, don't need govt. parents. Why do you? @POTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenSnell6 @peterson_hoyt @DJ_BV1988 @BryanDawsonUSA @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews  https://t.co/ALYyyf6dAL  Yep they sure do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peterson_hoyt @DJ_BV1988 @BryanDawsonUSA @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews But you know it's not a universal truth. Smh  https://t.co/ALYyyf6dAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peterson_hoyt @DJ_BV1988 @BryanDawsonUSA @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Ditto<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peterson_hoyt @DJ_BV1988 @BryanDawsonUSA @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Ca has 1/3 of all people on welfare. Largest illiteracy in US, debt and taxes equal a great state.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS The Dems haven't done any work in 3 years why would they start now. It goes to show they don't care about anybody. Look at the kids with the #ClimateChangeHoax Dems have done nothing for these poor kids. Rather they try to get rid of the PRESIDENT WE ELECTED<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump We are watching Dems destroy themselves right in front of the world. @POTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr A law needs to be made that if allegations are fake or you are lying, you go to jail for 10 years minimum. That would stop it. Sick of what the Dems are doing to the person We The People VOTED as our president. @GOP needs to jump in and time to stand up and fire back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tesla Love his name is around. By far the greatest inventor to ever live. Edison was a liar and a cheat. But, if your car was a true Tesla it would recharge itself using electricity from the earth. Yes he did and why the government and others cut him off. Can't charge for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peterson_hoyt @DJ_BV1988 @BryanDawsonUSA @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Btw, I live a simple lifestyle by choice. And I don't want ANYONEs helps. If I can't get it on my own I don't want it. It is the greatest thing I ever done, I dont owe and dont need. It is great to be free and not a slave to dems when .70 of every $ will go to pay 4what you want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peterson_hoyt @DJ_BV1988 @BryanDawsonUSA @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Let's see, Ca ran by Dems, taxes in Ca take 50 cents of every dollar earned. That sounds fair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All anyone needs to see. Biden messed up and under Obama! @POTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @senatemajldr You don't nothing in 3 years why start now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @senatemajldr Nothing can get done with all the fake news investigations going around. Way to go with their democratic led media. People aint that stupid, you only wish they were.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi Really. The things you are accusing @POTUS and AG Barr about is what they are doing to investigate y'alls illegal activity. So you are messing or obstructing their investigation. All the while doing nothing for #ClimateChange or healthcare. BTW, do y'all work?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HouseDemocrats you really think people are stupid don't you?  So comical because you have accused people of what this article says they are doing. Seems you are trying to block an investigation. @POTUS  https://t.co/GAijoWBS04<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davjalex I really hope they put you back on BB. You deserve a chance to play. And many of is wanted you to win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@POTUS We love you and thank you so much for all the hard work and standing up to the prideful crybabies. And fighting the good fight. We are behind you 100%. And at least you work. You have done in 3 years what dems refused to do in 8 under the great obama.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure how FB got so many people for it was and is less than what we had on myspace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@facebook @Myspace We are tired of the bias in our media and apps that get info from us but block for being conservative. When FB will be taken down by the Dems and they sell nothing. SO, we all need to go back to MySpace. It was much better. Wallpapers and Music for your page.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr @Twitter Been saying for years, we all need to go back to Myspace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews I have said this myself, and it will be against an abusive government. In our constitution and military will be on our side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BryanDawsonUSA @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews That was Democrats, Lincoln was a Republican. Dems were and still are for slavery, now they just want to make us slaves to them. You really want to work and give them 70% of your pay. That's their goal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HouseDemocrats Love love love seeing y'all mess up. Kinda sad to, like watching someone die. But deserved. Don't care about healthcare or climate that they claim to, but have done nothing. Just want to make up lies about @POTUS #ClimateChange #HealthCareForAll dems don't care 4U<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>but it's not real, it is fake. We have evidence that shows this. But none of you want to know it so keep freaking yourself and your children out. Just getting your panties in a wad, that's all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ClimateChange #ClimateActionSummit2019 do you want to know how this is fake?a political thing in America, dems versus Republicans. if it were real all we would hear is China and India. Because they are not playing with you. Can't do anything unless they're on board.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDemocrats #ClimateEmergency what is being done with the 16 yo special needs girl, is totally disgusting. I work with special needs for and I would slap the parents and any adult in the face for allowing this. It is abuse. Over something fake, a little research will show you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And if you do force and get rid of a President we ELECTED!You will not want to live in that America. No holds barred. Sure it will lead to a civil war between the people and the government. And military will be on the people's side. So sit down and work or your job is gone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDemocrats  @LibDems So audio of Biden telling Ukraine to fire a lawyer or will not get a billion dollars and nothing said or done to Obama. Now a Fake story about @POTUS and you want to impeach. Please try, you will see the biggest landslide in history. Believe us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ClimateChange #ClimateStrikedc #ClimateAction Obama brought a house on the beach. Guess he is not as worries about it as all of you. How is that possible, he is your leader. BTW, another way the Democratic party has made you their slaves, or as we say these days, their B's.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ClimateStrikedc #ClimateChange Ice Cores show in the past 200,000 years the climates changed and many times rapidly. Wake up y'all, they only want your money!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ClimateChange #ClimateStrikedc #ClimateAction What you folks have done to kids should be abuse. Feeling kids with fear over sometime FAKE. Kids: research the sun and solar flares and also The Year without a Sun. CC is not real, look at Iceland Ice Cores, 2 miles long.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VZWSupport Thanks for no help. In store 45 mins to pick up something I bought on the App. WHY?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@verizon Makes no senses to order online and pick up phone when you spend 30+ mins in the store. I just want to get a phone, from now on Wal-Mart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Goes to show no one watches the news. Google NASA's announcement on climate change. As I been saying for years, it is the Sun. Also, if real we are 4% of the world population, and since China and India have told climate change folks to go to H, ur lighting candles in the wind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Drive_pedia I stopped reading any article on here, they seem to not know how to write. Think they maybe teens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBSBigBrother Need to stay out of the game production. Everyone is  outraged you all helped Jackson in the POV. That was wrong, he never would have won without the assistance. So of he wins does production get half the money. Only fair Jury learns this before voting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Then don't allow gas to go up. Supply and demand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBSBigBrother Only way Jackson wins is on a game level. He will not have the votes if personal voting. Esp. if he does to Cliff and Nicole what he is planning. RN I see Cliff, Nicole, Tommy or Christi not voting for him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kaitcoaching No it won't, and Cliff lost it at the end. Love to ask if Cliff would take Jackson over his wife, smh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crazy people will find a way, so why only when someone kills with a gun it is the guns fault. I'd much rather a guy have the gun than a fertilizer bomb that will take out a whole building. But y'all never talked about making fertilizer or cars illegal. They feel y'all stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDemocrats @POTUS What is the lefts obsession with guns. Ok City bomb no one blamed fertilizer, and can still make that bomb. When a car is used to kill a lot of people no one blamed the car. Each case the person was blamed. Take the guns, then wait for the fertilizer bombs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another example. Last night they brought up kids in cages. Ok, this was under Obama. Why would they lie to you? You need to ask that question. Also, I watch Live PD and when arrested if there is a kid in the car, kid is taken. #POTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now their promises are to people who are not even citizens. They don't want anyone at all, just votes so they can stab you in the back. Obama could have done same things with Jobs, but did he? Have Dems? AND, bottom line, Dems want everyone to be SLAVES to them. #POTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDemocrats @LibDems As a logical thinking person it makes no sense why any minority supports Dems. In ALL the years, name something they done for you. They have made a ton of promises but still nothing. Can you see? And only hope is to scare people into voting for them.#POTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ClimateChange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been saying for 10+ years. We are traveling through space also. It is the Sun and our orbit so sit down and shut up. It is about money for Libs, and that's all.   https://t.co/J8iPgG9dpq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkSanford 1st- Trump is God's gift and we love him. 2nd -Trump is clean, sorry you don't care how he talks, we don't like how Politicians talk, - you are not clean. 3rd- Trump is for us, you may vanish and say you are hiking. You lost any future vote of mine. Support Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LewisHamilton Love you, you the man. But if you do truly want to be educated, Google the year without the Sun and Solar Flare that knocked out all telegraphs. And if one hit today all electronics are gone. Volcanos and the Sun should be our concern. BTW sun more active last 30ys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#YangMediaBlackout Really? You all just now realizing the media is biased. Trump been feeling you for years now. Wake up, it's how the Dems work and it will not change. Yang is not big enough.   https://t.co/SXHmGHkG52<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump There down fall is their dumb commercials. I swore them off for that reason. @GM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Release those from Jail, today!!! Show them. It was illegal so charges were illegal. If they in jail many Dems need to join them, and Obama for he was the leader. If not then all this was done on his watch. Don't fool yourself he started all this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So when does everyone get charges dropped and released from jail. This whole thing is illegal so no one should be in jail for a fake investigation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ACCFootball @theACC @accnetwork @GeorgiaTechFB @ClemsonFB SEC network is free. So real football is free but JV is not. ACC you need all the support you can get. This is a slow death of the ACC fans. Better games and better product for free, imagine that. ACC will never be top dog in football because of dumb things like this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@accnetwork @swaggy_t1 @isaiahsimmons25 Poorest rating in NCAA history<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NWS @POTUS It's to cold. Why has no one mentioned this???? In 50s this AM in SC. Way to cold. It will turn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SECNetwork making @accnetwork look bad. SEC wants you to see their games, ACC don't. @espn is to blame too. Y'all stop supporting the ACC and they will make it free quick. Should have been from start. How is it possible the ACC claims to be big but SEC and BTN say hold our beer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nike @Addias So we the US people are to keep taking up the A from China so you all can make billions? Why don't you all give China billions to pay the tariffs. We have built China from the unfair trade. Why don't you write a letter to China and tell them to trade fairly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@accnetwork @ClemsonFB Interesting everyone gets the SEC network. @SEC @SECNetwork BTN also.😂😂😂 ACCN, really?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BernieSanders Got to blame somebody, can't be because you Dems and Libs are so out of touch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McCreadyForNC I'm raised in the South and have NEVER seen or met a white nationalist!!! So since you claim to be so smart can you point some out for us? Or just keep you Liberal agenda of lies and fake news and why your party is falling apart. So thanks, for we are not dumb.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lowes needs to be fixed, no reason for other staff to not know what to do, but they didn't want to do anything but be on phone and talk. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.  Great job Hassle Free! @KobaltTools<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Obama, your great leader, doesn't believe in climate change. Buying a house on a beach??? 😂😂😂😂 But it will be gone in 10 years. #ClimateDebate #ClimateChange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeckDems Hate to say it but when you let child molester, who is in the country illegally, been deported before,and you release him back to the public instead of ICE, you are putting your own children and grandchildren at risk. Poor victims must feel no one cares. Losing votes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hillsongworship Sorry, I just thought a writer for Hillsong music would have a better understanding of the Bible. 1-Aliens are anyone from another town. 2- Going to follow one of those you must follow ALL of them. I'm so thankful I got the only thing I need-JESUS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RashidaTlaib Can't blame anyone for not wanting a TRUE RACIST to come to their country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BridesBlush People don't know how to write, lmao. Or writing is difficult for people. And for some people writing isn't easy. Some people repeat the same thing over and over. And over and over they will repeat the same thing   And then repeat again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@genesimmons 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC No it's called stupid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Breaking the law? Sodomy is against the law in 12 states. I don't agree with these cousons but you are all being hypocrites to your own beliefs.  Put 2 gay men on who left their wives, with kids, and lives in a state where sodomy is against the law and say the same things. Jeez<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrPhil Show is a judgmental. When some people feel the same way about gays the way you and your audience do about these cousins, they get blasted. Sorry, no difference. If there is LGBTQ needs to change Love is Love and add Unless Related.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankFigliuzzi1 @NBCNews there is a guy on the web that says all birds are drones built by the government. Sounds like a job for you all. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @OANN Good for a laugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Thank you for not making this political like the evil party has been doing. Be surprised if they don't have fundraiser for their political party off of the lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Want to investigate something? Why is my phone and apps changing the typed word God to Good???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankFigliuzzi1 @NBCNews and for the last piece of stupidness, heil Hitler in English means hi Hitler. Dude you're so dumb.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankFigliuzzi1 @MSNBC @NicolleDWallace @DeadlineWH Isn't it great we can make the gunning down of people Political. Great job. If it was my family member you would all hear from me. Disgusting. Glad I have a great Good who handle all this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankFigliuzzi1 @LincolnsBible @FBI 54, love history. Study about WW2, never heard anything like this. Sources DAs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankFigliuzzi1 @CathyYoung63 @Ibishblog @AnnCoulter No, because to know this it means you are one. And again, FIND THESE WHITE SUPREMACIST YOU TALK ABOUT. Jeez. Guess what, your and alien because i said so. Btw, this is your logic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankFigliuzzi1 @MSNBC @Morning_Joe @JoeNBC @morningmika So glad he can influence others. So I take it all your kids do exactly what you want them too for you can influence people with just words now. Dems would never lost of this were possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankFigliuzzi1 @POTUS Please find all these racist and white supremacists. Never seen or met one my whole life. We know y'all are lying and that's what makes y'all look so dumb.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankFigliuzzi1 Because Dems want stop hate. You hate on the President everyday, and what does hate breed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankFigliuzzi1 @NBCNews It's so odd you know this about 88. I have never heard of this in my life and I study history. So you must be a Hitler supporter, how else would you know this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCNews @NBCSports @DaleJr I think Dale needs to have some words with some people. Now the news has an FBI analyst call the new Sports guy, Dale, a racist and fan of Hitler. #88 Dude, 88 is 88, can't take back what he said. BTW, isn't it odd he knows this, guess he is one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeadlineWH @FrankFigliuzzi1 @NicolleDWallace I thought to be in the FBI you had to be smart. This is scary this guy was allowed in, never heard such stupidity. Wow, I'd be ashamed to be mentioned with this guy. #88 Earnhardt!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump We need a law which makes it illegal for Politics and Press to join forces. Can we??????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWEBrayWyatt @WWE @RealKurtAngle Love what you have done with your character, just let the Let me In and Follow Me crap go man. The best is, RUN! That I like, Let me In is not. But no matter so glad you got it right. Thank you, your to good to not be relevant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @kilmeade @foxandfriends Mr. President, I would call them out on how disgusting it is to make this political. And if words make people do things then all of our kids would be well-behaved wouldn't they.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankFigliuzzi1 @NBCNews 88? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I never laughed so hard. Hey @DaleJr they think we cheering for Hitler. Best investigation you all can do, go find all these white supremacist you always talkin about. Lived in the South my whole life never met one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankFigliuzzi1 @NBCNews can either of you pass the salt, I can't seem to REACH it. Maybe y'all can cover the Illuminati and how they set up Washington DC and run the country. Or how the aliens are among us or even the Earth is flat. You really think anybody thinks you're news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BetoORourke God will not be mocked, especially when you try and profit off the death of people. So when things start happening, some call karma, you will know why. God don't play, trust me. Imagine the families of these victim's? Hearing you all not caring, only to try and blame on Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BetoORourke Our President had made this country what it is to be, what all of you and Obama told us was not possible. So since our President has done great you have nothing to beat him on, so you turn the death of 22 innocent people into a political ploy to get rid of Trump. Disgusting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BetoORourke Whaaa, I'm a Dem and I believe others can make people do something by their words. How does that work on your wife and kids dumbA. And if that was true Dems would always be president as much as you lie. Beto is a liar, racist and white supremacists.(see we can say it too)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BetoORourke 22 people dead &amp; Beto don't care, if so then would not make this political. Way to  care about yourself. And if Trump's words set this off Dems words set off Ohio, he feared climate change y'all spread to get money. But I am of God which means Self Responsibility and Self Control<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LibDems @TheDemocrats It's the President's fault!!!!???  Um, one shooter was so concerned about climate change he had to kill people to help it out. And who pushes this? Who pushes hate everyday in Media and with their words? You do!! #climatechange #ClimateEmergency<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HouseDemocrats ,y'all keep talking about Russian interference. Do you idots not realize that if there was Russian interference, that happened under Obama's watch. Investigate him. @BarackObama #wearenotstupid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And you will never make more money with that attitude. What catches fries the best? BTW if Dems every get how they want, no more sports, no one will have money, no national teams, no money to support, and go to a socialists country and see how they treat gays. Y'all are geniuses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I been hearing all week about some woman putting down Trump and America and I'd say Who? A women soccer player from USA team I learned. I don't even know her name to @ her. Girl, we don't know you, so we don't care what you think, jeez. Go lose to some 15 year old boys. @USWNT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepJoeKennedy @AOC @RashidaTlaib @RepEscobar @AyannaPressley Wonder who they got that from, YouTube same about Democrats protesting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC Then why does our government and others still play with the weather for at least the last 50 years that  we know about, stop the lies and the cover up. #climatechange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC Thought you worked for the government? If you all had been working the last 3 years maybe wouldn't happen, plus we all remember Obama started it, fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE @WWEAleister So dumb, um why don't you knock on someone's door. Take it he is hurt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDemocrats #LibDemLeadership  You all understand we sit around and wonder how dumb you have to be to fall for the lies. CEO? Corporations? Most of thd largest companies in the US are owned and ran by Democrats, so you're talking about taking from them when they give to you. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iran Get ready, mess with the bull you get the horns. We spend 10 times what Russia does on military. Just so you know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ClimateChangeIsReal #ClimateEmergency I hope all who believe this know: Our government and others have been controlling the weather for over 50 years. There is even a Treaty that it cannot be used in war. So IF the weather is wacked now you know why.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@republican @GOP When in Charlotte for convention you should have the President speak at BOA Stadium so we can fill it up. I'd come! @POTUS #MakeAmericaGreatAgain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They don't want the US to do anything about climate change other than give them money. We are only 4% of the world population, that's called pissing on a forest fire. #climatechange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC @ABCWorldNews Wondering if you will ever report real investigate news again. And not be slaves to the Democrats. Your rating would increase so much you wouldn't need them and could be truly unbiased. But that's the past and now you're the Dems bitches.😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi If no one is above the law what have all you Dems being doing to Trump since 2016. Liars and Barr is the justice. You all have lived above the law for to long with Obama, time to end your lies. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi Of couse you don't trust Barr, for he is about to bust all of you liars. Going down so just take your medicine, deserve what you get and including being voted into nothing in 2020. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi you have lied to all of the US citizens for 3 years, so what should you do. But no fear, time is running out, Dems forgot life's best lesson, what comes around goes around. Look how great things are and you Dems still hate and divide. Best the US has been, not you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HouseJudiciary Can't wait for all of you to be out of office and lose power in 2020. Going to be great. One thing most people hate is a liar and you and your media have been doing going on 3 years. Payback is a bitch. #itscoming<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC @NBCNews @CBSNews @CNN You guys have the opportunity of a lifetime, the biggest fraud and cover up in US history and you can't investigate it because you're arms of the Democratic party. I'd rather be broke and homeless than to live without integrity and a backbone. #RiseUp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris You need to resign now. What you all have done is absolutely unacceptable!!! Liars!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HouseDemocrats It's comical you all think we can't see though what you're trying to do, knew day one with no one's help. You are all guilty and who should resign. #truth #RealNews I'd rather be broke and homeless than to live the life you all do, such a sad life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HouseDemocrats @TheDemocrats Why would anyone vote for Democrats? They do no work, help no one and don't care one bit about any voter. And it's clear for they make it clear, so I am confused what you are voting for, cause they have done NOTHING.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UNC_Basketball @dukebasketball @espn Great game refs. Duke didn't have a chance if not for refs. That's BS to not get the game everyone wanted, but you got to have Zion on TV don't you? SMH you didn't win Duke, refs gave to you, hope it feels nice. Won't see D in Final 4, 4sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@accmbb Man these refs are obvious, 3 was all over UNC player, both hand, and of course no call. Glad refs make a great game like this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@espn UNC getting murdered, but by God touch a Duke player.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AC360 @CNN @RepMikeQuigley Glad Fox News is coving the REAL news. Summit is awesome!!!!!!!  Thanks @FoxNews and @POTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris Not for ALL the people. Here is the deal. Poor people, she wants your vote. Rich people, she wants your money. CA is in big time debt, have big time poverty, but she doesn't care. If you can't run CA no need to try the country. Smoked one to many it seems. 🚬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@POTUS #ImpeachTrump #Democrats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnn @CBSNews So glad Fox News has the REAL news from the Summit and getting and giving the scoop. The Democratic ran fake news outlets covers the distraction. Wake up US, Dems want to bait and switch, look what's over here, instead of covering a historical event in our lifetime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @POTUS And now @AOC want to take credit. Never seen a clueless woman like her. Someone even has to write her notes for her. And #newyorkcity elected this immature uneducated person who says they are not for discriminating but all are to Trump. We thank you President Trump's.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mandys610 @POTUS @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems It's been 2+ year and nothing more today, just a sham to take away from Summit. I assume you don't realize he's only being treated this way because he's not a politician. So if you are I ran, if you are not a politician, would be treated the same way. Caled discrimination.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice try Dems, but we know you by now as racist liars you are. And very discriminating to Trump. Who is looking out for ALL people while #Democrats try to divert our attention. THANK YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP. @POTUS @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems #Cohen  #CohenTestimony #TrumpKimSummit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @SenateDems People this is all a lie and fraud to get your money to go to their friends, that's all. All facts Dems use is from a Cartoonist and those 97% of scientist, most of all said they were taken out of context, it was a lie and they will tell you CLIMATE ALWAYS CHANGES. Res ice cores<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer @senatemajldr In NC the Dems also cheated and when brought up the Dem lead NC gov wouldn't investigate that. But never heard that on the news did you. Keep lying we will get the truth out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Why do you want to talk about stuff you know nothing about and are not an expert on. I would think he's a hell of a lot better negotiator then you are any of your friends. Plus you're too old, your mind has left you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FYI, it is in the bag, Trump will win re-election mainly because of how stupid the Dems are. They are all filthy rich but want you to think they are everyday people. HA! And it takes a billionaire to relate to us. #ImpeachTrump #CohenTestimony Hate Dems for I HATE a liar. Trump!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really hope ALL the US realizes if out of the blue you decided to run for president and never had done polotics in your life then you would be treated the same way. All we are seeing is losers who don't want ANY  non politician in Washington. Job equality? NOT #CohenTestimony<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NRCC Why can't El Chapo's money be used. But yes, better than becoming CA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris Hey whatever you like fine, ain't nothing there so climb back in your hole, you don't have a chance, and you really need to fix your state. 1.2 Trillion in debt, 6 Million illegal imagrates, and 7000 a year per household to pay for those PROTECTED illegals. You're a genius.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelCohen212 Nice lying again. Where is proof of anything you racist. And if I was you I'd say why should I go to jail when Dems allow illegal imagrates to break the law everyday. I would really hate to be as old as all of you, Dems too, and be so stupid. And get a job lazy bum. We have to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC Why does he go to jail when Dems won't send someone that comes here illegally? And on top of that pay for them. You all need to go, back asswards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytimes Anyone wonder why he gets 3 years for lying, breaking the law, but they won't put in jail someone who comes here illegally? Think that is the definition of a hypocrite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenWarren Please name those achievements. I have been asking for years name one good thing he did in 8 year. Look what Trump did on one year. Kinda funny Obama did nothing in 2 terms. Hahahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenWarren Let's keep killing 4000+ babies a day, and you think believe anything you say about caring for kids. Actions are louder than words and all Dems have been loud and clear. Kill babies born or unborn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenWarren Anyway to help unborn babies? Are they not our future?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenWarren And what makes you believe they would stay???? Would you???? I wouldn't. Do you know how many people have lots of kids for the welfare and taxes???? And now you want the rich to pay their daycare so they can sit at home to do nothing. What a great idea. Wow, old and dumb is a sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenWarren Unless you're a baby.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Sort of like the FAKE TRUMP COLLUSION? SMH<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SenWarren @PattyMurray Unless you are a new born.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepCummings @SenWarren Great job DuAs, didn't get the info to people until the AM. Suppose to be 24 hours ahead of time. Why you all don't have real jobs, for that alone you  would be FIRED!!!!! Fakes and you Dems are the racist and liars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris Unless you really want to make a lot of money. And lady some people have one job and work 80 a week, unlike you 20hrs a week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris The people coming is the bigger problem lady. Grow up. And worry about your state, it is almost bankrupt, got so many poor people it is a shame. But you CA folks never talk about the poor in your state.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris There is no gun problem, at all. A crime problem, take it on and you will see. But your agenda is to take down the US, get rich from taxpayers and make the US as you want to all then money comes to you. If you wanted to be rich don't serve in office. You are a SERVANT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Refinery29 @AOC Do you ever realize cost of living is different all over the country? In NY 15 an hour may not be much, but in the country it's a fortune for a 18 year old. And when will you FACT CHECK YOURSELF?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN @ABC @CBSNews @NBCNews Hey, you ALL said Trump's illegal activity was coming out. What happened? And you wonder why you all are called FAKE NEWS!!!!!!!😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😅<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SenFeinstein These kids should be taken from their parents to scare them like this. Kids hope you see you are being brain washed by Dems and your teachers.

<|startoftext|>@TheCWSupergirl needs to be canceled since you fd it all up. To me it is so funny there is LESS THAN 1% of gays in US but every show wants to bow down to them.

<|startoftext|>@TheDemocrats @dncpress Thanks for spending millions of our dollars protecting people who break the law.

<|startoftext|>Never seen one of these be real. All are fake, don't believe me follow the stories. All in past where done by server or owner. SMH @FoxNews   https://t.co/cp8PDshdOq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @POTUS 3 Weeks folks. Dang the media is so fake. And btw, in ALL the stories about people out of work never heard how much they make or benefits they have. SMH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenFeinstein If people serious about global warming then first we do away with all hygiene and beauty products. They are not essential, not needed as a necessity and would reduce those companies. Be a great start and show your serious. Cause most against would never go without their beauty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndreaS98612222 @SenFeinstein guess that Volcano is selfish too. Plus you breath that gas you dead, not passing out. Also just do a little research on the sun, which can put is back in the stone ages any day. Happened during telegraphs. Also research a day without the sun. So where is the plan when it does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndreaS98612222 @SenFeinstein Mostly sulfuric acid. Why they made people leave, to dangerous to breathe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenateDems Reductions is coming!!!!!! Thank goodness, end them and never bring back. #GovernmentShutdown @POTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenFeinstein It's the Sun, fools. SMH. When one volcano gives off more pollution in one day than the world in one year, and you expect us to believe this. Educate yourselves folks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenFeinstein Liar, bow to him, and wait for eternity to end. Feel sad for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDemocrats @SenateDems Dems don't care and only care for self. They think they better. But don't realize their strings are being pulled by the ruler of this world.

<|startoftext|>@michaelstrahan @NFLonFOX There we have it, SHAME!!! A LOT more people in need than Clemson football team, even in Clemson. But let's be political again. How nice, thanks.

<|startoftext|>@ABCWorldNews #GlobalWarming #ClimateChange The scientists who claim it's the sun never get press. Stop the brain washing. The Sun has been more active in the last 30 years, forget the fact the volcano released more pollution in one day than all of us in one year. Stop volcanos!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABCWorldNews  So biased? Asking Trump about tear gas on kids? Really. In USA the parent would be in jail for putting their child through that. A shame you going to do that to your kids. We all have some responsibility on our own. STOP THE BRAIN WASHING!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But she could not remember a few weeks ago. Also when people like  they say did not, should not, instead  of didn't and shouldn't,  so she is lying, listen how often she does this. Fordercent' certain Kavanaugh assaulted me  https://t.co/ehqbNN0hka #FoxNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @POTUS I have never seen such liars and spoiled babies than I have from the Dems the last few years. I WILL NEVER VOTE for a Dem ever again. Reason folks don't come forward is because of things like this, The Salem Witch Trials.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jimmyfallon @jimmyfallon @L8ShowColbert I miss late night TV. Horrible enertainers will sell their craft for a political party. What happen to comedy, music, fun and escape?

<|startoftext|>Wow the #GlobalWarming lies vanished fast. Guess Trump and a couple of volcanos helped that. Hope everyone caught that the volcano in Hawaii spewed out more toxic gas than we do in a whole year. How you gonna stop that? Need to be concerned with the Sun and the asteroid coming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FSCDems @RepMaxineWaters And all of you in government who are overpaid and have outrageous benefits aren't the cause. SMH. We truly need to make a law where if you serve you are going to serve our country, which means you don't get paid much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill @RepMaxineWaters No one cared about Bill Clinton's mental health and he did it in the Oval Office for God's sake. You people have no morals or ethics.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PitBullChat people need to get over their fear of Pits and all dogs. We have one that is scared of everything, so loving to everyone and will lick you to death.

<|startoftext|>@TheDemocrats @HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats #racist I think Dems need to wake up. You say the south is racist, but every story I see about racism comes from the north or California. Mmmm. In the south we don't have an issue with any race, but obvious the north is more racist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jimmyfallon @OffsetYRN @MetroBoomin @RicFlairNatrBoy I am shocked at rappers, they don't believe they do an art form and I guess they don't. When you don't allow ANYONE to sing your songs you are not an artist, and your music will die in time.And really smart to say a work only 14% of people can say. I'd want to be worldwide.

<|startoftext|>@F1 if you hope to keep the great integrity of the sport you may want to close pits if a safety car. Looked suspicious when two Red Bull sponsored cars wreck each other and then other 2 red bull sponsors go in pit to advance on track. No such thing as coincidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NRA Get the kids off of psychotropic meds. We should be disgusted with ourselves to talk about guns when it is mental meds that are killing our youth. More die from suicides and they don't use guns.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NRA #NRAKillsKids Wow how bold, kills kids. 3500 abortions a day, more deaths in cars and psychotropic meds are fine though. Even though they kill more kids than guns. Should kids take a drug where side effects are suicidal thoughts and harmful intentions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NRA #NRA #NRABoycott #NRA boycott NRA members please be voicing your feelings to the companies that have taken away discount. Go and give bad reviews &amp; complain to the BBB for misrepresentation as a business and not a political organization.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NRA please forge the education of the people with research. Data is this: Guns been around forever. School shootings and mass shooting only in last 20 years. We have data to pinpoint the cause. I feel shootings and teen suicides all linked to prescription psychotropic meds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hertz @Avis @Enterprise @Budget Ironic these companies no longer allow discounts for NRA, but the product they rent kills more people every year than guns come close to #NRABoycott #NRA  Btw, none care about kids, 3500 killed daily. Not a word said, but we have a gun problem?<|endoftext|>
