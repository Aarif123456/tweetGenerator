<|startoftext|>Yes! Love this post!!  Think of every other application or test in the real world...none of them are one and done. Why do we hold our learners to a different standard?? #KidsDeserveIt #WhyITeach #edchat<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>...but if we have T‚Äôs who have a unbiased mindset, get to know the whole child, and use actionable data for each L, then our interventions would have an even bigger impact?!?  Please tell me if I‚Äôm crazy. #leadinclusion #KidsDeserveIt #edchat #whyiteach<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1/2: It feels like we are so hyper focused on intervention that we are avoiding root aspects that can assist the interventions in having a larger impact.

<|startoftext|>Besides coaching Ts, I guide 37 psych L‚Äôs. It‚Äôs been a struggle to truly know them.

Their words humbled me to my knees. #wholechild #leadinclusion #voice  https://t.co/TAkjEIFCa7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our learners are not just data in a book &amp; what impacts their growth is WHO they are. We must remember: 90% of the curriculum walks thru the classroom door each day. We must ask: what are we going to do about that? How is their story guiding the process? #edchat #leadinclusion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SaraKAhmed  thank you for your voice, your story, and inspiration today. It was a pleasure to meet you and I am excited to bring these ideas to our staff to challenge mindsets and bring awareness to how much more we can do when we think of our learners as individuals.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Lyricalswordz A5: Ive had the pleasure of hearing from @MisterMinor recently.He talked a lot about how to hold other accountable. right then and there or within 24 hours (depending on variables). This informs my options. Knowing that no action is not allowed #PrivilegedChat #BreakRank<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lyricalswordz 1) listen better. 2)help her amplify her voice (sometimes with my voice when privilege can help, and others by getting out of her way). 3) remembering humility #PrivilegedChat #BreakRank<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beRealcoach @CSpearsEDU Yes!  When you mention those words I am reminded of my sociology training and our discussions of the power elite<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lyricalswordz @beRealcoach @ProfCAnderson @DrIbram we need to amplify voices.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lyricalswordz too true!  thank you for these words. when i read them this is where I see myself too often. love the fail forward concept! #privilegechat #breakrank<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lyricalswordz A4: i have got in the way by justifying actions of others. when a teacher or admin has talked to students about being grateful, or that they 'should know'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizzieFortin @sherrillknezel @Sneffleupagus @ThurstyTeach @she_veatch For me at the school I work in we are starting small by inviting T's to talk about these topics over lunch. to share readings and articles. To help educate the miseducation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrsB_TCE too true!  major growth is needed on this end too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lyricalswordz Q3: so my plan to fix that is to actively listen more, and to hold myself accountable, so that I can hold others accountable for when failing to educate themselves on the history of racism. #PrivilegeChat #breakrank<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lyricalswordz Q3: I have failed to educate myself on these issues when my partner had issues and I did not listen well enough to understand, or support her needs. My lack of understanding and previous listening caused my failure there. #PrivilegedChat #BreakRank<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrsstipemath @herbertmath628 im just getting into white fragility. what are your thoughts of it so far?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CSpearsEDU good question, one i am reflecting on more and more these days. the step of listening is important. In coaching I listen to my teachers, actively, to help them solve student issues. When it comes to topics in this chat and others i need to listen more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lyricalswordz Q2: We need to discuss our failures and talk about how we can do better.  Its like in teaching: when we have students who struggle we help them by addressing the struggle and finding a path towards success.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lyricalswordz Q2: I think if more people from privilege took his example and followed this may become something that is not as difficult to talk about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CSpearsEDU Also, as someone coming from privilege i do not have the answers, though I want to be a role model for my children and students whom battle equity day in and day out. for me to be there for them, i need to shut up and listen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CSpearsEDU Too often in my role as an instructional coach i am looked to for answers. how to deal with these students, what activity may be best here. It is a nice reminder to listen more. the more we listen the more we will hear the answer in others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lyricalswordz A1:  I was humbled by his words. No matter who you are it is not easy to stand up.  It inspired me to put copies in lounges and another colleague and I are looking to start lunch convos with those who are interested to dialogue about these topics. @ryanr_lester #privilegedChat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lyricalswordz A1: this was a great read. his framework for next steps were simple &amp; I appreciated his honesty. It was a motivator for me to listen harder, and hold myself and staff around me accountable. A copy of his story resides in each staff lounge #PrivilegedChat #BreakRank<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LizNortonTAP set aside time in TLT and cluster to share success for a few minutes at the end. helps remind us who we do this for #edtapchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A5: in the 1st year there is such a desire to do it all. take small bites. over stuffing yourself only leaves to issues later #edtapchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A4: #tapcon14 reminded me that it is all about student achievement, and that we must constantly steer the ship back on course #edtapchat<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ShastaLooper Agreed!  Our CT's noticed the change right away and have bought in even more #edtapchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SDCherokee thats awesome! we are looking to as well, how have you thought to incorporate it?#edtapchat<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tapsystem @wintersclass Anissa Rodriguez.  Went to most of her sessions. Very insightful and she really helped us redefine FT. #edtapchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A1: cluster in a bubble was very insightful, we are incorporating a more strategic agenda in our clusters as of last week #edtapchat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tapsystem @twitter most definitely! Can't wait to collaborate with everyone during #edtapchat #hcpatappers will be in attendance!<|endoftext|>
