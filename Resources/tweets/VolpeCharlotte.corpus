<|startoftext|>We now see that governments are able to take drastic measures to preserve #human and #globalhealth. Why isn’t this the case when it comes to #Climatecrisis? Is it because the consequences are not clear enough..? #COVID19 #climatechange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Totally supporting the decision of the Norwegian government to go in a “shut down”-modality. Let’s avoid the spreading of #COVID any further. #Norway #shutdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JED_Science @sleepdiplomat I am loving it so far ! But yes - because of this new sleep pattern that I’m experiencing lately I’m also kind of worried for my mental health 😂😂 would be cool to know if there are any physiological changes in the sleep pattern of moms? Adjusting maybe...?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Considering that dreams are created in your REM sleep based on your experience. Do babies dream? What do they dream about..? Would be cool to know. @sleepdiplomat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reading “Why we sleep?” By @sleepdiplomat in such a sleepless time of my life (maternity leave) and learning how essential sleep is for your sanity (😅). I can’t help but wonder: how do we manage without going crazy?<|endoftext|>
