<|startoftext|>@CharlesMicheaux @debofficially I recognized the surname immediately. Anthony's mother died defending the rights of people who look like me. Unfortunately, she's been forgotten. But I haven't forgotten about her. Good to see her son following her path.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkWSchumann Yep. From @BrownUniversity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What exactly did he teach his students? I teach mine what I learned working toward that #PhD. No matter what subject I teach - and I've taught many.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is why Epstein's screed is so damn awful. Especially coming from someone who experienced the "life of the mind" at @UChicago. (my alma mater)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What did I learn from my #PhD in  #Slavic linguistics? I learned to probe, question and think. Those three skills are why I'm an excellent journalist. I may not work "in my field" but that degree prepared me for my life's work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@natalieymoore @Ebonyteach I remember that cuzzo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RubyTuesday_72 @AshaRangappa_ It was common to let folks lecture if they had a college degree and professional experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I deleted my tweet about the @WSJ oped on DrJillBiden because I included an inaccuracy. BUT that misogynistic claptrap needs to called out.  I have delivered no children but I am still DrAfiScruggs BA @UChicago PhD @BrownUniversity<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@8fuld @KarenAttiah Your story and @KarenAttiah's are so necessary. Much love to @FKAtwigs for her courage and willingness to share.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@8fuld @KarenAttiah Wow. I'm sorry but I sincerely hope your sibling made it out safely. My cousin was killed at her mother's house! Such a dangerous yet common occurrence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytimes Yet not one call for a national day of mourning, flags at half mast nor any other recognition of lost lives and emotional devastation. #IHaveNoWords.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarenAttiah Having a safe exit is so important. An abuser shot my younger cousin in front of her family.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This story gives context to Gebru's firing. Thanks @Vice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickCastele Please yes. I'm so tired of convincing deer to let me into my driveway.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EddyMcChesney @pancakebooti @heard_before @koriroys @braveenk Your first sentence supports the diversity argument because you're pointing to problems in the pipeline. However my 30+ years as an employee have convinced me that expertise doesn't matter at all when it comes to promotions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heard_before @koriroys @braveenk I have to ask you. Why do ask that, given the percentage in the employee pool. (Pre-pandemic of course.) Do you really think no women applied for anything of these position.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#lovethis<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Russian_Starr Nope. I have problems with "Defund the police." I think the slogan doesn't communicate well, thus too much time is spent explaining it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Of course they do. SMDH.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NPR Here's the reality.  Making stuff is easy but selling stuff is harder. Any writer/musician/artist can knows that truth. You have to develop your own platform before a business will take you seriously. It's no fun either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NPR In other words, Substack's business model imitates life, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Samuel Little killed four women right here in NEOhio<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I had to share, LOL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lrochellew Cause they are scared of backlash. I had it in late July. Was told I cd go out on Aug. 3. I stayed in until Aug 14  I am still scary about.going.out.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@twobluecats @HannahLebovits Go inside and stay. That's the big difference. I would think an MD would recognize that fact.

<|startoftext|>@kat__stafford @PhoebePetrovic Not so old, Kat. I was just 11 when the Voting Rights Act passed. It's the reason I've voted in virtually every election since I turned 18. Straight up Jim Crow.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TeriLussier @Clevecarole Hell, I remember 2000.  And 2008. And 1964/1965... I've seen 2 presidents impeached, 1 resigned, 1 assassinated. I'm amazed at how much history I've witnessed in my 66 years on earth. And that's just in America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SceneSallard This was a thoughtful piece. I say that as both a journalist and performing artist.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Don't take absentee ballots to your polling place. They won't be accepted. If you've applied, but haven't received your absentee ballot by Tuesday, go to the polls and vote a provisional ballot. #Ohio<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KarenAttiah Wish I could. I'm covering the election in Cuyahoga County, Ohio.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarenDZachary @KarenAttiah I used Audacity, I think. I had to teach myself to split on the zero crossing, and to identify the parts of the song by the shapes of the wave.  It wasn't a remix, LOL. But it work.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Zip_It_Hippie @RachelDissell @CleveObserver @cledocumenters @blackgirlinCLE @NEOhioSojo Environment is the circumstances of folks' lives: quality of housing, pollution, access to health care.

<|startoftext|>What we didn't get to hear last night #positions #policy #platforms<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another perspective...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously though, you know Biden revealed exactly what he thinks of #45. Those quips weren't rejoinders IMHO. Nor were they Freudian slips. He thinks the pres is a clown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My thoughts as well. Don't need to write a column to summarize this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@8erpentineskies I need some of those as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@8erpentineskies I have some as well. We just haven't gotten around to installing them. I'm hoping they'll deter the deer. (Hoping, not expecting)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Taking a social media break form current events to work on my music, play my bass and drink some wine. See y'all in a day or two.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkUrycki Wow. I didn't even know there were riots in Akron.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JazzPreacher Thanks Mark. This has happened before when we were kids.  I can tell you exactly what I was doing when MLK was killed. Being a self-centered teenager, actually.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am a #Boomer. I was 11 to 14 during the long hot summers of 1965 to 1968. I remember my parents anger &amp; bluntness as I watched TV. What are you telling yr grandchildren now? Plz share in comments. Trolls will be blocked and starved<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohh lord yes!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TonyaGJPrince I'm with you. My dad put 20 years in. We often talked about the irony of defending a nation that segregated him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SceneSallard I. Just. Can't.  https://t.co/b84Onp0CiD's coverage of Tamir Rice was shoddy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@athenakugblenu @WritersofColor For sure!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CLEPublicSquare Whoa. I missed this getting ready for the concert. Thanks for all you're doing for musicians and bands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Read this FIRST (if you haven't already) And Then comment or share. It's from the Hennepin County Medical Examiner.  https://t.co/E9iNilDtaF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soundofideas  Smashing Heinens and Geigers is not a way to fight oppression. That did not happen after the Brelo verdict. Why did it happen Saturday?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@webjournalist @ThePlainDealer Yes. That's what happens when you kill a newspaper to destroy its union and outsource the design desk. I do wonder why the front page wasn't remade. Isn't it all digitally designed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@webjournalist @ThePlainDealer Yes, unfortunately. I'm sorry I'm so late with the responses. I've been cooking. BTW, I'm a @ThePlainDealer alumna. Several of my former co-workers are flummoxed about this front page.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@webjournalist @ThePlainDealer No. I did not. Thanks for tagging.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OtTracie @mattwrighttv No. They were not bought out. But everyone was laid off or "voluntarily" left after being told they could not cover the city state or region.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BTW, Thx for all you're doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This thread demonstrates why there are so many accounts of the protests. Perspective matters. Not one is "right" nor "wrong." Time and place determine what's seen, heard and reported.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@webjournalist @ThePlainDealer The website is  https://t.co/b84Onp0CiD, which is a separate entity from the now-defunct newspaper. Separate management, non-union and separate staff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JGrzelewski A station in St. Paul did just that. @anniezaleski can tell you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@webjournalist I am ashamed to show what's left of the Cleveland @ThePlainDealer front page because there is no photo of the disturbance at all. #LocalNewsDied here  https://t.co/uXRZ3XrpHa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@learothawms The sanitized King. That's the best one I've read in a while.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blackgirlinCLE Which plague is this one? #5? Do we have 5 more to go? Feels like it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, this is gonna be an interesting column rotation with @rgay as the  #WorkFriend.  https://t.co/X92z2kZf9h<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SceneSallard Stay Safe @SceneSallard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can my twitter community suggest sources who can speak on what happened to African-American communities after the long hot summer of 1967? I have an idea for an article I want to pitch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robincha @JoyAnnReid It's an opportunity. Especially since we have a racist narcissist in the White House.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what's happening in Minneapolis:  https://t.co/LKeXQ8iTok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is coming from @JoyAnnReid. I am posting because I trust her. Just an FYI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RachelDissell Those crack me up, too. I'm like, I wouldn't open at all if I could finish it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkDice @bubbaprog @jack We didn't see the same clip. It was obvious they were aiming at reporters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you @AP for linking to  the story from @EyeOnOH in your article on another @CDCgov removal of guidelines.  https://t.co/K4TAJhq3th<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrubek 50 Feet from Stardom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@learothawms I didn't know folks didn't know about fish and spaghetti until I went to @UChicago. It was the regular Friday night dish - even though we were Baptist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arcwrites I saw your story on @Vox. I reported a similar story in Ohio, but stumbled upon a surprising development. I'm sharing with reporters hoping we can open this up.  https://t.co/mSLrwIOqPl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@najournalists I reported this story earlier this month. Given what's going on with COVID and POC, I'm sharing with you. The Navajo nation was specifically mentioned.  https://t.co/mSLrwIOqPl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@learothawms We've been drinking cherry coke for years, though. We got it at the drugstore (Showing my age.) BTW I Hated Moon Pies cause they were too sweet. I guess that means I'm not a true Southerner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aschweig Please send me info on how to do this. I want to know more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@learothawms What's gentrified? Cherry coke?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrTTGreen @LangstonReview Yes. I read that article. I was like:  https://t.co/9ikTUkNSgW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KA_Marketplace Wow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katgyrl @jpawgmafia I got you. Learning HTML so I could teach my students HTML from scratch so they could build pages and get jobs, LOL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HannahLebovits Wow. This is great. I missed this. Thank goodness for social media. We'll still be in touch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdrienneWrites What is the flower? Do you know?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreeNewsome Bree, I don't think that's fair. We both know Dems of that era. upheld segregation. 2. There were different approaches, we both know that. But to credit young folks by calling their elders accommodationists is unfair and inaccurate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gomegmo Try this. I have a subscription, so I don't know how well this might work if you don't.  https://t.co/ExhGd8iQom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gomegmo I'm looking for one as well. I'll probably order one from the site.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what 100,000 looks like<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even the worst of times can be the best of times. I have met so many of you all here. Thanks for your thoughts jokes and your passion  https://t.co/StR0tCFjS3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dem8z Sarah lol. Dinah Washington was on my mom's housecleaning playlist. I am still marked for life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sandylocks There's actually more to the story. We tried, but couldn't get to the bottom of this.  https://t.co/mSLrwIOqPl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because Nathan Bedford Forrest should not be a hero.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robincha Ironic isn't?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robincha I'm sure some will. But #ActionsSpeakLouderThanWords This rush to reopening and the excuses made for it SMDH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What I've learned from #COVID. In the #US #OnlyMoneyMatters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amk44139 @maurerlawllc I second that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whew, so many innovative things going on here in Cleveland. For the next week, I'm spotlighting what I find. Please share.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@8erpentineskies That's for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@8erpentineskies I planted mint in a pot. Next thing I know, it was growing runners to root in other pots. Since then, I just put it in the ground and let it grow/go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@8erpentineskies Good luck with that, LOL. Mint is a colonizer/imperialist plant. If you can contain, please teach me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahBuduson @OhioJFS It's a lot more than 2 dozen, I think. My timeline is full of folks who have received this:  https://t.co/lR5wmwfCTi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Clevecarole @karr_pe Did it work? If so, send me those instructions, LOL. I got tons of lavender here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Clevecarole @karr_pe Me too. I pretended to be Gregor Mendel when I was in grade school. Went around trying to cross pollinate plants in the backyard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RachelDissell @newsguild Believe it or not #obituaries #SaveTheNews.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate it took a pandemic for the #USDA to acknowledge 21st century grocery habits. But better late than never. This needs to become national, BTW.  Thx to @sabrinaeaton for this story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robincha Yes it could.  The issue, of course, is recognizing broadband as a utility.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LangstonReview Wow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clmwalkscle @vincethepolack No. There were really tough questions in the chat. But the moderator didn't ask them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The digital divide gets deeper. Lack of infrastructure is just of several things enforcing digital exclusion.  https://t.co/LALWWKGME5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jaden_Reports @maggieNYT Wow. Condolences to the family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@binajv @GlobeOpinion @GlobeIdeas Thanks for posting this. I'm an experienced columnist reporter with a strong portfolio and knack for uncovering things.  Here's a link to my most recent #COVID article.  https://t.co/mSLrwIOqPl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaNoriaFilm I know LaNoria is considered a horror film. But to me, it's a love song. I saw it at the #CIFF44. It's one of my favorites.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @KevinVesey, my sincere apologies to you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks Darrel Rowland for another great story. This is quite concerning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@siegrist4INrep @AllisonLCarter @SallySiegrist @siegrist4INrep, I'll delete and respond to the correct person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@siegrist4INrep @AllisonLCarter @SallySiegrist I'm sorry. Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@siegrist4INrep @AllisonLCarter @SallySiegrist see my response.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustTheFacts37 @AllisonLCarter @JessicaHuseman I was trained to be objective in news reporting as well. Notice the word trained.  Natural biases are present, but you can learn to overcome them, if you're willing. That's the beauty of journalism: in challenging readers you challenge your beliefs as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PugMafia2 @mhdksafa My condolences<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhdksafa Yes.  He died. His wife survived.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, I am a musician. Yes I play bass. And yes, I hope to perform virtually this summer for @CLEPublicSquare. It's gonna be a party!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jarvisdeberry @ReillyCenter @LABudgetProject Check out this story I just did for @EyeOnOH We're still trying to find out why the guidelines were changed.  https://t.co/mSLrwIOqPl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jarvisdeberry @WritersofColor Good to see you hit the ground running. Gonna miss you in #CLE216<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THanks to Richard T. Andrews and #TheRealDeal for picking up the story on the #CDC's policy change on COVID #POC  https://t.co/Ly1KnmoQZL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deadacated1 @LSTrip44 You said it so I don't have to. You are soo on the money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NPR Please look at my story for @EyeOnOH. The CDC guidelines specifically mentioned Native American communities - and then they didn't.  https://t.co/mSLrwIOqPl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YimbyEarth @BariAWilliams @MorganJerkins The difference, though, is the pronunciation. My aunt is Eye-dah, which is how Aida is pronounced in Senegal. BTW, I'm also convinced Effie and Essie are Americanized versions of Ashanti day names.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BariAWilliams @MorganJerkins I'm convinced Ida is an African retention, similar to Aida. In Senegal, it's pronounced Ida. I had a Senegalese boyfriend who was thrilled when he heard my aunt Ida's name.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarleyCQuinn @thechelleselena @MorganJerkins I think I understand what you mean. I think some of these "old" names are holdovers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KendraJames_ @MorganJerkins Was she light-skinned? I'm Southern. Pinkie was a pet name for a light-skinned woman.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@geneticginger @HannahPekarek Why would folks give up their DNA for a diet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@esouthersHVE Have you read Tim Spofford's book on the incidents. You might have to search for it because it was published in 1988 by Kent State Press. Try to find it, though. It's great.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neorsd Oh man. I just took the protectors off the cauliflower.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JTK1985 @dingle_rob @PDNewsGuild @ClevelandScene Barely a paper period with four folks left...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is great news! Thanks @RepMarciaFudge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BoomerGal65 @darreldrowland No. That's a new testing protocol. It's the one @riteaid RiteAid is using in its drivethru stations. I guess it's becoming the norm now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GChristCLE Feeling the same way about the cake I made for my partner's mom for #MothersDay. It's really great. So I'm hitting the trails.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From @ABJDoug, more of African Americans' lack of access to  Coronavirus testing  https://t.co/EpVLyGRqMx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, if this doesn't convince me to pray, nothing will.  https://t.co/hXSvmdOnXg via @politico<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DC_DeWitt Been saying this since 1988.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For a while I was praying nightly at 9 p.m. for all those affected by #COVID19. Then I had to stop because the spiritual load got too heavy. I will resume  this week. If you want  a prayer, let me know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@omnivorebooks My condolences<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewBlackMan I've just been reading about this. Thanks for posting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LibertyHangout And... don't see anything else happening that's worth killing someone over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dem8z Me three.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marthabayne Anticipation is making me wait. Keeping me waiting. Plus I already bought tons of stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marthabayne I promise, matching flatware will be the first thing I purchase after COVID.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here in Ohio<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RIP #LittleRichard Because of you, I've played piano for more than 60 years. I saw you on American Bandstand when I was 5. That did it, right there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lesliequander What age is the target demographic?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dyrdaisy @nkjemisin Hahaha! That's the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JillMillerZimon @netinclusion I hate that it took a catastrophe to get this issue some attention. Remember that Internet summit from 2017? CLE City Council heard the alarm three years ago.#BetterLateThanNever I guess..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LauraMcShaneCLE @sos_jr @clevemetroparks @hikethebt @CulturalGardens Edgewater has nice ones, actually.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stay til the end. Don't spoil it. Our laugh for the day. @tamjeffries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@esouthersHVE We're seeing in Ohio, especially against Dr. Amy Acton.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MLSchultze Here's another for you. I should have tagged you in this tweet:  https://t.co/mSLrwIOqPl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoarseWisperer @MattGertz I was gonna send him that link. It's really dope.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@curatorconnelly @whet That is beautiful. Savor it please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sagreen1913 Yes. BTW, my brother-in-law and my nephew #RollTide. Hope to meet you one day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sagreen1913 Sharony, it went to a 404 page. I'd love to hear others. Thanks for reaching out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CDC guidelines on #COVID testing changed again. Mention of hard hit groups are gone. https://t.co/mSLrwIOqPl @washingtonpost @TheRoot @theGrio<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for the retweet @8erpentineskies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@natalieymoore You'd be interested in this story, I'm sure. #CDC changes #COVID testing guidelines on race. Twice.  https://t.co/mSLrwIOqPl via @EyeOnOH.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CDC guidelines on #COVID testing changed again. Mention of hard hit groups are gone.  https://t.co/mSLrwIOqPl @tressiemcphd, you might be interested in this one.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@imeanswhatisays @NewBlackMan Let me guess:  Cookout? (which we don't have here in Ohio.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kingsrush Probably, unfortunately...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bluefunk2020 @sagreen1913 #KendrickLamar sampled #GrantGreen for his song "Sing About Me." That was how I learned about Green.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcusNewling What you said...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pomeranian99 Looks like Audrey in Little Shop of Horrors doesn't it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still, the change comes seven weeks after the pandemic has decimated minority communities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This means #AfricanAmericans, #Latinx and members of the #NavajoNation may now have better access to testing...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The CDC guidelines now prioritize #COVID19 testing for asymptomatic folks from hard hit racial and ethnic groups This is huge!  https://t.co/5CEo1OWMay (more)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too much of this is going on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LawrenceHall105 I saw that. She's lucky....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amy_Siskind @GChristCLE , re your thread about sources and reporters...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandyLudlow This is so tiresome...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosephWMead I was today years old when I learned that. Thanks for the lesson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darreldrowland Did you ever think you would even have to write a sentence like that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LauraMcShaneCLE @aliciakeys Thanks for sharing this with me.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Lrochellew @ThePlainDealer @NwakaOnwusa This is what happens when you fire the copy editors and gut the newsroom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see stop gap efforts, but I'd like to see more, especially from governmental officials at municipal and county levels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If nothing else, the quarantine have shown the depth of digital exclusion and its consequences. But is there now a coordinated effort to address this inequality in NEOhio? If so, please tag me or send me a DM, so I can investigate(more)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I live in the Cleveland area. My computer is my life line.  But all this talk about a new post COVID virtual world overlooks those who don't have digital access. (more)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PurpleCarrotXO Oh I'm in there, LOL. Got basil and tomato seedlings in my kitchen window and just planted onion and peas in my community garden plot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks @Tylerjoelb for highlighting all that's being reported here in the Buckeye state. Readers, follow the thread, please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LawrenceHall105 no snark intended to you about me being a reporter. I'm just being sarcastic about the poorly reported story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LawrenceHall105 I'm a reporter BTW. The reporter should have asked two follow ups: If it's not a confederate flag, what is it? And why are you wearing it?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RandyLudlow @GovMikeDeWine This doesn't surprise me at all. I predict we'll be in and out of lock downs for a while. I'll go out on a limb and say until year's end, at least.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dageorge1 @MGonidakis @darreldrowland You haven't been to the Walmart in my neighborhood. If you had, you wouldn't say that at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahkendzior @JYSexton I have to disagree they're an appendage of the White House. I'm thinking of Yamiche Alcindor, Jim Acosta  Mary Louise Kelly of NPR , April Ryan And The Washington Post which was on his butt about Khashoggi's murder...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SoSaysLucia @EyeOnOH @RachelDissell @GChristCLE @Cidmonster @SceneSallard @OPinfo, do you know about this?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Wienerdawgy @indie_sunshine They are fine. They were cooked. If you wish, put them in a deep skillet, add just enough tomato sauce and tomato paste to cover. Season with salt, pepper and garlic. Add sliced onions. Cook in an oven at 350 until the meat falls from the bone.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@learothawms I heard him on NPR explaining how his town became a hot spot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go on. Grab this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DWill5 @hughessociety I love this one. It brings me to tears.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm ineligible because I write for them. But you should read what's on the site. And share.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amyhanauer @TheCityClub @davidfolkenflik Thanks. I'd forgotten about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GChristCLE I always think about advice I received from a therapist back in the mid 1980s Think about things you can control and work with them. I don't remember her name, but I've never forgotten her advice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RachelDissell Thanks. I've bookmarked this thread.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elonpage1 @rcallimachi @africaupdates She said Senegal could get answers in 24 hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Real_BeautyOfRa Hey, I've been thinking about you. Glad to see  you're alright.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@weatherbryan Thank you for your concern, and for your coverage. Stay safe yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@weatherbryan My sister and brother-in-law live in that area. They said the community is devastated. I live in Cleveland, Ohio. Do you have any photos? Please post if so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@News4Mass @_SarahGTaylor @HughesRosana They said the entire neighborhood has been devastated. That's all I know. I'm following you for any images you can pos of the area. But they say damage is bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@News4Mass @_SarahGTaylor @HughesRosana I Iive in Cleveland Ohio. My sister and her family live on Shinnecock Trail, near Igou Gap and Shallowford. They are trapped in the house because of fallen trees.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_SarahGTaylor @HughesRosana @News4Mass I appreciate your coverage. My family lives near Shallowford Rd and they got hit badly. I'll be following your tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlairReeves @jbouie Yep. I order all sorts of stuff online. USPS drops it off at my door.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ashkan @MixedRaceTaco @Tylerjoelb But it was much better to be able to report and write without having to worry about the photography. And having two layers of editing was a life saver.  BTW, I filed daily...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ashkan @MixedRaceTaco @Tylerjoelb We didn't talk about "content" then. (I left n 2001). It was a very different world. The paper set the news agenda for the region. And jobs were specialized. I'm not necessarily nostalgic for the old days... (more)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ashkan @MixedRaceTaco @Tylerjoelb I was one of the 340. @ashkan The Plain Dealer was the paper of record for the region.  The 340 did not include the sales staff, the circulation staff, the delivery staff, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bonnie_Nov57 I do not know you, but I will add  you to my prayer list and ask for comfort in the time of your family's grief.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mgiant Stopped procrastinating as much. But I expected Hell to freeze over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whew! This is the only sermon I need for Easter. Thanks @RevSethDub<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelMcIntyre I. have. no. words.  SMDH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mxthemme Yes. I didn't pray tonight. Too much sorrow, ironically. But I got you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MorganJerkins I am so with you. I can get dance. But mime? NO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GChristCLE @ThePlainDealer You did the right thing. #AskMeHowIKnow. And you'll be the better for it. I wouldn't say it if I didn't believe it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lorenanthes @ScottNoll_News @jeffsleasman @evburnett @KateWarrenCLE Yes. I stumbled upon those CDC maps last week. Thanks for tweeting them out!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarisaMeltzer I had to tweet you about your 4/9 article on workout tapes. I didn't have the Jayne Kennedy VHS. I had the Jayne Kennedy album! Yes, she was on vinyl! It's long gone. Thanks for the memory.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@natalieymoore If you don't have buttermilk, use yogurt. It's a great substitute. Try it in skillet cornbread. You'll thank me.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@edhelms @danmoulthrop I really like Angelina Baker. Thanks for playing this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JillMillerZimon @Lrochellew @marlenetaylor48 @AmySheon Thanks. I will starting on Wednesday. I just got the contract for a story, so I'm full steam ahead now. The lack of consistency is stunning. But maybe because I just didn't know about it before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AprilHirsh @RachelDissell Exactly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RachelDissell I am quite skeptical about opting out. Especially since death certificates routinely list race. Why not  have race/ethnicity when it comes to COVID fatalities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RachelDissell I would have tagged you in my response to the City's rationale for retracting race from  stats COVID cases. But now I can't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I mean, how many African Americans aged 60+ live here? Giving the race isn't invasive and you know this! @JillMillerZimon @Lrochellew @marlenetaylor48 did you all see this? #YesIAmAngry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CityofCleveland  refuses to release the race of COVID19 cases in order to protect privacy? Just how is listing race invasive? (more)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CityofCleveland  refuses to release the race of COVID cases to "protect individual privacy." (more) How is telling the race, along with age and gender an invasion of privacy? (more)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jbarro I'm reading the replies. I love how folks think the only way to be a reporter is to work for the NYTimes. #IfYouCanBeatMeRocking #YouCanHaveMyChair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PQBoston I've been talking about this all day! I should give you a call.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamSchartman @JillMillerZimon @HannahLebovits @JosephWMead Thanks. I'll work on this on Tuesday and get back to both of you. I gotta find a spot to publish this column/article/whatever it turns into.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jbalmert @OhioJFS Thank you! I've been stalking that site day and night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosephWMead @Lrochellew @AprilHirsh @JillMillerZimon @HannahLebovits @KateWarrenCLE @lorenanthes Thanks to all of you for your prompt replies. Let's cross our fingers about this one. I'll share more information if I can make it happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GChristCLE @RachelDissell And one day, I'll learn to spell! #IMissCopyEditors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GChristCLE @RachelDissell Great minds think alike. I'm grabbling with this very issue now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pkalina @skorasaurus @HannahLebovits @JillMillerZimon @JosephWMead Sending you a message now. Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are any of my twitter followers/helpers data gurus? I have an idea for a story, but I need to run the methodology past someone knowledgeable. @JillMillerZimon @HannahLebovits @JosephWMead  plz send suggestions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CrookdRiverWmn Without a doubt! I was always polite and cordial. At the very least, I said "Hello." My parents taught me to respect everyone. It paid off for me in so many ways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandyLudlow Sorry to hear this. Stay blessed and stay safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlltheFlyThings Girl, especially the bra!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlltheFlyThings Yes! Or... a discrete finger pointed in a certain direction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ebonyteach Not to barge in but... did you giggle when your parents tried dance? (I did and still do...)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In other words, never, never overlook the little guys. You never know when you might need them. Looks like the entire country is learning that lesson the hard way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One thing I learned early in my journalism career. The best sources were the janitors, the secretaries and the security guards. The secretaries typed stuff, the janitors threw stuff away and the guards knew who came in and out. (more)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RachelDissell I didn't mean it a snark to you. I meant it as snark to KellyMcBride's comment about all money being bad money. You can say that when you've got money.  Hope this clears stuff up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffsleasman Because women have options now and divorces are easier. People didn't get divorced, but they separated. A long marriage doesn't equal a happy marriage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RachelDissell Hello. I've become much more pragmatic since I've left daily journalism. I'm on the outside looking in now.  And grappling more than before with the erasure of voice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VoteJeffJohnson @ThePlainDealer @PDNewsGuild @RachelDissell @BrieZeltner @LauraDeMarcoCle @GChristCLE Don't forget @OPinfo. She's one of the best I've met in my 35-year career. She's not out front much. But she's thorough and brilliant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brianrhester @olevia @RachelDissell You are kidding me. Her too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MyFriendCamilo Yep. No words. SMDH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelMcIntyre Sorry to hear this. So much institutional memory has been flushed down the drain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robincha @VoteJeffJohnson @ThePlainDealer @PDNewsGuild @RachelDissell @BrieZeltner @LauraDeMarcoCle @GChristCLE Yes. 18 folks are getting laid off today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laurasolomon Actually working. I've been working from home for years. Maintaining focus has been a problem for years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HannahLebovits Will do. Give me a few hours. I'm book marking this tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ebonyteach I am so guilty. But a younger friend put me in my place. She said. "It's great when folks know what songs the samples really are." LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WillTarter @meganfrancis @nvancleve @Zoom @TheCityClub @danmoulthrop Whoa. Didn't know that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notd_io Hope you're legit. Several friends might be laid off today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Y'all so many out here are suffering from COVID-19. When I say I'm praying for you, I mean it. It's one of the few things I can do...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LangstonReview @dem8z Is this the "deacon" singing about coronavirus? Or is this something else?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@45Whistleblower Just added you to my prayer list.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robincha @baseballot @LWV @lwvohio LWV and ACLU have a lot to say about this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dradambanks Mine too. I love it when the TV folks drop the facade and get real. LOL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maxsparber @Betzine Thank you. It's really a comforting sentiment. I write eulogies for my friends when their loved ones die. I'll definitely work it into those eulogies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maxsparber @Betzine Bunny Sparbar, that's a lovely thing to say: May his memory be a blessing." May I share it and use it? I'll credit you of course.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@stevie_mat @SpikeGhost BTW, we're not talking about four figure rents here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevie_mat @SpikeGhost Stevie, I guess we have to agree to disagree. But for many of us, the rentals pay for food, utilities and other necessities. If that makes us parasites, so be it. #NotLivingLarge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevie_mat @SpikeGhost Social Security doesn't cut it. Especially if you're poor, older and POC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevie_mat @SpikeGhost I know. For many of us it is the sole source of income. Yes, I read.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeptemberJoy24 😂 I love it when TV people get real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevie_mat @SpikeGhost Hold up. Some folks use the building as a major source of income. I know several artists who do just that. #DontJumpToConclusions. And here in the RustBelt where home values have plummeted, others rent out to get value from the home.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Someone gets it...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@learothawms I get those robocalls all the time here in Cleveland. Tell him to hang out and don't engage. I'll bet the script starts: This is Ryan... I know this is out of the blue, but I wonder if you want to sell... (or something similar)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dem8z I've been giving away books and fabric for years... I "Bless" them so they make someone else happy. #GottaPlayMindGames to reduce my stash.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dem8z Y'all want some knitting yarn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ebonyteach That's so sad. My circle is thankfully intergenerational. I'm enriched by that diversity, so ageism in any form cuts deeply.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@evaholland Thanks for your work. I just learned about this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DianeOhiodiane I love the theme from The Courtship of Eddie's Father. #HarryNilsson is one of my musical role models.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ebonyteach #TellMeAboutIt #Boomers thought we'd never grow old. And here we are: listening to folks call us by the names we called our parents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnbrownreborn @erikwdavis @Ebonyteach Plus the Depression-era elders practiced racism and sexism. That gets lost in the discussion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnbrownreborn @erikwdavis @Ebonyteach I meant understanding can transcend present circumstances.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnbrownreborn @erikwdavis @Ebonyteach But the tenured track prof hasn't always been on that path. Plus understand can transcend present circumstances.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ebonyteach The comments in this thread are stunning. I'm in my 60s. Do you all really believe you're not going to live 30 to 40 more years?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rathernotsay @LionessRisingx @classic_shoe @ryannabbfilm This descendant of slaves sees similarities because certain groups of immigrants are dehumanized. I'm not gonna argue with @rathernotsay, because s/he thinks the law can operate without regard to mercy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dradambanks I'll be walking around the park behind my house. I'm avoiding the gym. And I have some interviews to complete so I'll do those and then I'll be finished.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sidecut Thanks for the heads up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sidecut It was at least on Saturday LOL. One dish will last me three days. Seriously, I love eating out. This is gonna hurt!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sidecut I got carryout from Zoma on Lee Road yesterday. Maybe my intuition is stronger than I'd thought.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sidecut I guess. But remember the Dear Leader's minions control the state's Republican party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sidecut Thank God is right. DeWine really is taking the lead on this one. Regular press conferences, transparency... Makes you wish someone else was paying attention...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sidecut Yes, about 2 p.m. this afternoon. Too many folks hanging out in bars and restaurants. So now, no eat ins. Carryout and delivery only.  Also expanded unemployment benefits for workers affected by COVID.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohio bars and restaurants close close indefinitely as of 9 pm 3/20/2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dradambanks What you said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ca_Rule I'm not an academic anymore, but that is a great idea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosephWMead It's refreshing isn't it? I'm not a fan of DeWine, but he has my respect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HannahLebovits I was impressed that they actually addressed that issue in the news conference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for being proactive. We will need the spots now for students forced to take classes online.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ramccafferty My #SignOfSpring: I got my plot for the community garden already. I'll share kale when it's ready.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This, #UsingWisdomToCreate is my new hashtag. Thanks Tamara.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robincha And she pushed against everyone, from what I've read. I understand she was eventually ostracized. But I'm not surprised. You grow up fighting, you end up fighting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. Definitely #IdaBWells. She's long been a role model for me. I wish I was half as fearless as she was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tamjeffries That's a great observation. And I like the hashtag #Keepliving<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@benlandis It ain't that deep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because, believe it or not, I'll probably live at least 15 more years. So please share and I'll share and retweet. Thanks #Boomer #rolemodels (Trolls will be blocked. So sad I have to say this.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll make a list so when I need encouragement, I can look to them. Nothing against younger folks at all. But I need role models from my generation and older as I look toward my future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What I long for, however, are #rolemodels among my #boomer peers. Please share your suggestions. I'm looking for folks, 55 and up, who are energetic, creative and effective as well as compassionate. (more)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To my boomer friends: Who Are Your Role Models? This is such a youth-oriented culture and now we are on the receiving end of its bias. (Rich irony, isn't it?) But at 65, I'm doing so much more than I ever dreamed when I was 35. (more)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NOLAed4Liberat1 Unfortunately, it's going both ways. This is gonna be a nasty election season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robincha @oldiewankenobe We need to quit lusting after folks who don't love us, and hit on the people who at least like us. I say let 'em go and focus on folks who are at least persuadable.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bb61ea05 @Notrealdavidp @SandraBundy @Yamiche You mean this proposed directive from the Obama administration, which state election officials shut down in 2016? I remember it. I live in Ohio and our SOS opposed the policy.  https://t.co/lxFELvaRs8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robincha @EllixFlowers Yet? LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosephWMead I'd be getting lots of exercise, LOL. #ISayPopToo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RachelDissell OH Sh***<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GennHutchison Yes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LauraMcShaneCLE @SafetyEditor @EyeOnOH @RachelDissell No. I didn't.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SamSchartman @sos_jr @ConnectInsight @ClevelandScene I'm doing my best. I hope I got it right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love how all these Cleveland institutions are "discovering" the "poverty crisis." #sarcasm of course<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamSchartman @sos_jr @ConnectInsight @ClevelandScene Here you are:  https://t.co/Wgh3bj54QU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ILoveMyCulture OOMG. This makes my day. 😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@7990beea006e4ba @HossmanAtHome Nah. Just make popcorn the old fashioned way: on the stove in a pot. And curl up and watch a black and white movie. And enjoy the present while winking at the past. #ImABoomerToo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ericsandy @EyeOnOH Thanks so much. This means a lot to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rockomcneill @alt_fda I figured as much. I've contested a couple with no success.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rockomcneill @alt_fda I believe you. I'd be scared to look, even if I could.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AMintheAM @DaniWKYC, I understand the segment on Raja Freeman is generating some hateful comments. Who is moderating? Have the comments been closed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LJBreedlove @AdamHDomby @KevinMKruse Yes. I explained that to students taking my history of journalism class when I taught in 2001. (Damn, was it almost 20 years ago). BUT, looking at the media frenzy following the beef scandals of 1898 was eye opening!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@learothawms The great Wilma Rudolph! She was such a role model when I was growing up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LangstonReview I would love to read those studies. Especially when it comes to Sherley Anne Williams. She was at Brown when I started there.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@USCriticalMess @lyndseyfifield @RAMRANTS @PeteButtigieg Those very reasons are why I'm saddened that Corey Booker and Kamala Harris are no longer in the race.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@natalieymoore Okay. I'll take yours. But your dad has a lifetime supply.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USCriticalMess @lyndseyfifield @RAMRANTS @PeteButtigieg Well that's not true. LOL. Conservatives said lots about Obama  being Black. The comments were just coded that's all. e.g. "sowing racial division" easily comes to mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@natalieymoore Awww. Sorry about that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dradambanks Nina Simones version of Here Comes The Sun by the Beatles.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Robincha @maggieNYT @MichaelSteele Everything you said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robincha @maggieNYT @Robincha did you read @MichaelSteele tweet about this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@learothawms Now that I didn't know. Thanks for all you do. I grew up in Nashville, but feel like I don't know anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RachelDissell @clevelanddotcom @ThePlainDealer Is it because the outlets are using stock photos? Because photogs have been let go as the staff has been depleted?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jfkenney @PatriciaHeaton Thanks for your reply. Signed: A Devout Baptist who is pro-choice. (It's your choice, not mine)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am emotionally exhausted... And it's only February.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My name is Afi...Otherwise, it's the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelroston I"ve never gotten that far. Thanks for showing me the apex.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HannahLebovits Did you apply? I hope so!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmberD1116 I hate how Christian has become a synonym for a certain kind of religious belief and practice. I'm a Christian, too. But according to these folks, I'm not going to heaven.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HaniDav83 @LeahRigueur Rock and a hard place. But abortion is a big issue for me. So I have almost no choice...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HaniDav83 Thanks for the comment. Please read @LeahRigueur book on Black Republicans. It's an eye-opener. BTW, I view Dems more favorably than Republicans because I saw the southern strategy in action.  It was a tectonic shift.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RibaSusan Love Ohio. This does make my day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has anyone made chocolate hummus? Can you share a recipe. (I know it's trivial, but sometimes we need a break)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SubodhChandra @SenatorCollins Did you read. Sen. Sherrod Brown's op-ed? It wasn't her judgement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so tired for sites using #boomers  as clickbait. Jesus, write a better headline.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Musa_alGharbi and @LeahRigueur were  invaluable sources for this story on Black Republicans. Thanks to @USATODAY for the opportunity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Musa_alGharbi @USATODAY Thanks for the tweet! I didn't know the story had been published. Yes our conversation was great. Unfortunately word counts constrained me. But your interview will really inform other stories I do on African American voting patterns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshuaGrubbsPhD My condolences<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaxMundi @beckyphilmath @e_j_barnes My favorite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YeshaCallahan How many so far? Not being snarky, just asking from despair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HannahLebovits Do an assessment. Don't grade it, but give credit for completion. Create a  multiple choice quiz for the concepts you want them to understand. If the explanations are satisfactory, you go to the next topic. If not, reteach.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marthabayne That last sentence. I'm 65 and folks need to #CheckYrAgeism. I did high impact African Dance until I was 61.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClevelandChick @hotincleveland @joycekeo My mom pulled $1,000 from her bra to pay for abt $500 in clothing,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrTedJ I reported a story on Black Republicans for USAToday's Black History Month publication. I'll tag you when I post the link.  BTW, @GiannoCaldwell, for Trump to do what you say, he'd have to beat Eisenhower's percentage That's quite doubtful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@naanking I feel your pain. How many times at how many hotels/motels have I been asked to clean a room when I simply trying to get in mine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Clevecarole Yes I did!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@learothawms Wow. Mrs. Leatrice McKissack. Really brings back memories.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tony_ganzer I love garam masala.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@learothawms It's still around?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GChristCLE I think I made about $275/week in 1988. And that was because I had experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KapustaDiamond Joni Mitchell's "Down To You" talks about that: "Things that you held high and told yourself were true, lost or changing as the days come down to you." I sing it to myself too often, it seems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gonzomike Exactly! Hahaha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maggieNYT @AndrewJTobias Thanks so much for correcting the story!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gonzomike @LangstonReview @dropoutnation Glad you put David Before Bacharach.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@8erpentineskies Uhohh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maggieNYT Back in December, @AndrewJTobias actually broke the story about Trump supporters handing out $$$ to African Americans. Please credit this local reporter for doing his job.  https://t.co/KzIsl6R43B<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytimes The Trump Rally handing out cash was first reported by @clevelanddotcom! Give credit to beleaguered local reporters who are doing their jobs.  https://t.co/KzIsl6R43B<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zainabsc24 But technology has made music much more accessible because you don't have to shell out $$$ for an instrument. And music technology can be a gateway to learning tech, period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zainabsc24 Because hiphop. And because some real instruments, like keyboards, are digital with all sorts of patches/sounds. Really, the means isn't as important IMHO as knowing how music works. Too many folks don't know basic #musictheory. And it shows. (more)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewJTobias @JillMillerZimon Thanks. I looked for another link to share here, but didn't see it. Just wanted to let folks know: "Yes. The news was broken locally." If I remember, you did a couple stories right: one reporting the rally and another about the cash?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@natbalda Since the world is coming to an end, probably not many. We might get as far as march.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewJTobias @JillMillerZimon @Yamiche Yep That's where I read it, too. Did you or anyone else write a follow? @AndrewJTobias<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JillMillerZimon @Yamiche Yes. I read it on  https://t.co/b84Onp0CiD  https://t.co/KzIsl6R43B<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yamiche Oh yea! I thought you knew.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ramccafferty @KapustaDiamond Y'all need to turn this thread into a column.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@azgrm @KevinCallanan @i0sTaila I'm gonna use that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nesteggPUB @LauzetaVentador @HKrassenstein @Twinsfan811 Unfortunately you're probably right.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kellymcb I was 10 or 11 when the voting rights bill was passed in 1965. Of course I vote. Every Time I Get A Chance.  Really the voting "issue" is a false equivalency. Journalists don't have a dog in every fight, and not all journalists cover politics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@natalieymoore My prerogative, LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@natalieymoore Can I borrow her?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tony_ganzer Yep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robincha @KyleCoroneos @CharlieMosbrook Yes. It's jaw-dropping.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rontheroller @RussWKYC @TVNewsLady I could tell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rontheroller @RussWKYC @TVNewsLady You never worked in a newsroom have you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to @jenamcgregor's podcast on hair discrimination against Black women.  The bad thing is that 30 years after Washington D.C. women fought being fired for wearing braids, Black women are being fired for wearing braids.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aviacionado @nytimes Thanks. I did check out steel cut oats from @AldiUSA, especially after reading the article.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amy_Siskind Yeah, I saw that headline and article. I was like: "Naww...I don't think so..."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KapustaDiamond This means many "boomers" have lost the financial cushion. The Great Recession kicked folks out of work who still have not been able to find jobs. Also I'm sorry for the ageist remarks you're getting. There's so much anger, everyone is suffering.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KapustaDiamond We should have talk, you and I. Don't fall for the stereotype of being born at the apex of American economic goodtimes. Many of those programs were stripped in the 80s. 401Ks replaced pensions; the collapse of manufacturing...(more)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dusttodigital I loved that song. Growing up, no one ever told me she played the guitar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@8erpentineskies @KapustaDiamond Please see the reply above.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KapustaDiamond Some of us refuse to retire because we can't afford it. It's not narcissism. It's economics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jackieleigh92 @ClevelandSPJ Thanks for including me on the panel. I learned a lot myself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dem8z You, this one works for me. I'd like to see what kind of explanation accompanies the cell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dradambanks I had to learn it when I came here. Now I do the second syllable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robincha @ChiSquatch Oops, forgot to add coriander and black pepper to the spice list. Same quantity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robincha @ChiSquatch Heat spices in a dry skillet until fragrant about 10 seconds. Add oil &amp; cook about 30 seconds more. Blend tahini and spiced olive oil in food processor.  Add remaining ingredients,  blending between additions. For smoother hummus add 1 Tbsp water at at time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robincha @ChiSquatch Roast peppers - place under broiler until skin is charred. Remove &amp; cover until cool enough to handle. Pull stem from softened peppers. Slice open and scrape away seeds. Peel outside skin. Put pulp in bowl with sliced beets.  (More)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChiSquatch @Robincha Posting now. Will tag you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robincha I just made beet hummus. It's really delicious. I can send you a recipe, if you'd like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robincha @dradambanks @dem8z @Lrochellew Mine too. And my friend really is brilliant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dradambanks @dem8z @Lrochellew The linguist in me asked: what words Do we use to when we acknowledge brilliance? Thus the tweet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dradambanks @dem8z @Lrochellew Here's the background. A producer friend was astonished when I called her "brilliant." I realize we don't think of ourselves as "brilliant" because our community doesn't use that particular word...(more)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dradambanks @Lrochellew @dem8z Let me clarify: The terms don't have to be connected to music, but the lyrics to the musical composition will contain  the words I collect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For a musical composition, I wanna collect terms Black folks use to signify creative genius.  I came up with #fire #lit #Beast @dradambanks @dem8z @Lrochellew can you help me out? Can #ETwitterCreatives &amp; #Activists &amp; #TwitterScholars help<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stampedinblind @nytimes Don't know whether you're being sarcastic BUT roasted cauliflower really does the trick for my sugar cravings. Please don't let it be bad for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just read Maureen Dowd's column on Meghan and Harry. I am so tired of white people telling POC to endure racism for the betterment of the "system." We do have lives We want to live.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MaoistKurtAngle @CityLab That is an investigative reporting project. Thx for the idea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaoistKurtAngle @CityLab Did you read the rest of the article, however. Highly still doesn't guarantee equity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lrochellew I must read and share.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@willreinhardt @bretjturner Now that is funny! I gotta go find some.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bretjturner Mine loved stickers AND seeing their name on the board with a star.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SAI Why is his age in the headline?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QuitaQuita41 @dradambanks Send me a message and I'll share the recipe. It's easy and delicious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joannasaurusrex @GennHutchison @imchristiepitts No. @JoannaMontgomery. It's not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joannasaurusrex @GennHutchison @imchristiepitts Don't touch my hair. And don't ask me about it. It's as simple as that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LawrenceHall105 Well I definitely don't agree with this:  "The World Socialist Web Site argues plausibly that the educational establishment and the press already do much more to adequately teach about slavery .... than the worker’s movement."  Slavery is barely taught!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dradambanks @QuitaQuita41 I wondered, LOL. 7UP pound cake is literally the only cake I bake. My late stepfather taught me to make it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dem8z One year, NPR announcers read the entire speech. It's a shame the way it's been watered down to concentrate on  a phrase King used in many of his speeches.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QuitaQuita41 @dradambanks Wait !?! Y'all don't eat 7UP pound cake?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dradambanks @QuitaQuita41 You must not eat a lot of sweets. They're in the cookie aisle of the grocery stores.  Archway makes great ones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tjuneaux @dradambanks I love strawberry rhubarb pie. Just the right mix of tartness and sweetness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dem8z Or teach the entire Dream speech. Like this part:.. America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked ''insufficient funds.''<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FrankGillilan13 @joeye6 @nytimes Jesus, just chill!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@womensmarchatw @nytimes Absolutely. That's why I've cut waay back on white rice, white flour, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytimes I'm good with fruit and avoiding processed meats But I gotta have oatmeal for breakfast. Sorry. Blame my great-grandma who eat oatmeal every day.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mradammorley Hey, saw your playlists on Spotify. Love them. I'm a blues musician and I'm following you. Plz check out Afi IPlayBass Scruggs. Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrubek My mom didn't understand why I majored in Russian. I went all the way. Got a PhD, taught and realized academic was waay too confining. So I got out. Then taught and taught again. Lesson: trust he won't stand up and starve so let him do him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rustyfoxfyre @juliaioffe Yep. And of course, that's the point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juliaioffe Sounds just like what happened to African Americans trying to vote in the South before the Voting Rights Act.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gray_the_cat @juliaioffe Still, that's a damn shame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boozetornado Especially the first sentence. And the last.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lincolnwashasty @Catalystrader @bencasselman @jennablan What you said. I track the race and gender of my sources. I use a spreadsheet. It works because it's quite eye-opening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bluefunk2020 You have just demonstrated why I feel there's no such thing as "gospel music" anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrubek @NickCastele He has none.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Clevecarole @JillMillerZimon Thanks so much for the compliment! It means a lot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bluefunk2020 You know you're old when your teenage dances become academic footnotes,LOL. #FourCornerQueenInMyDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bluefunk2020 Thanks. I believe you're right.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dem8z Not at my Target unfortunately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dem8z @Ebonyteach Tell me about it, LOL. I was a newspaper columnist. I was required to say and say and say. Three times a week. Fallowness was a blessing, believe me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To my local urban planners: Why did Shaker Square protestors rally to save a street?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robincha @SueZeeQueueC No, he's not. This will be his first run, but probably not his last.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ebonyteach @dem8z I really didn't have anything to say until I was in my late 40s. Then I published two books in four years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dem8z I was raised in the South  My family ain't play that Children Ham ish.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@leo_thuman @nytimes The fact is, this "real Midwest is white, rural Midwest" has never been true. Journalists should know better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leo_thuman @nytimes I know because I grew up in Nashville, lived in Virginia,worked in Mississippi, changed jobs moved to Dayton, changed jobs moved to suburban Cleveland's East Side where I still live. The fact is, Black Folks have been in the Midwest since the 1800s. (more)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leo_thuman @nytimes I'm just seeing this tweet and I have to disagree vehemently. Black people live in East Cleveland and in Lordstown. Rustbelt inner-city districts are part of the Midwest. The region is diverse. As is the Deep South (More)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking through my timeline and realizing I'm following loads of urban planners. The discussions are fascinating. (And zoning was my beat at my first fulltime newspaper job. If only I'd known then what I know now)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agordonreed @nellpainter How well I remember how you were targeted. Interesting, given those circumstances, that you were asked to sign the letter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dem8z @AdamSerwer Nell Irvin Painter's quote was extremely provocative..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dem8z @AdamSerwer After reading this article, I'm concluding the problem is one of perspective. African Americans are much more cynical about the roots of American democracy than Whites. (I wonder why) /more<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HannahLebovits But, I won't tell you how folks can't pronounce my name. It's uh-Fee. No, AH-fee and especially not Al-fee.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HannahLebovits I love this BECAUSE in the black community, it's pronounced the way Ellen pronounced it. So it's nice to know of a different pronunciation.  From now on,  I'll ask folks: ha-Sahn or Hah-san<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HannahLebovits Ohh. I understand that too well...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HannahLebovits #NotBeingJewishIAsk Can you turn it into a simple chant and sing it to yourself? I've done that, believe it or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewBlackMan Thank you! This article gets printed and tacked to my whiteboard so I can refer to it regularly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JillMillerZimon @adamvanho Yeah, I noticed that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JillMillerZimon @adamvanho I switched to decaf coffee because I like the taste of coffee. But I can feel  big difference now when I even sip regular coffee.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dem8z Y'all said it, so I don't have to.  Especially the low wage jobs part.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ijeomaumebinyuo A word from my ancestors and spirit guides. Thanks so much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danmoulthrop Oh wow. My condolences<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IAmTheJRSYDVL Oh she's good, LOL. I'm just in the weeds. I turned it in. Have a great holiday if you celebrate.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AdrienneWrites I'd tell you if I knew. I do know that I was and so were my sibs and my friends. That was 60 years ago, so the tradition continues,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jax6655 Yep. I knew of Oprah's father. He was a barber in my hometown. He was not a millionaire at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robincha No argument from me there.  His reasoning about why the child wasn't raped is simply evil. But the former chief medical examiner said it all, didn't he?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neorsd Y'all have too much fun over there. Thanks for getting your message across so creatively and humorously. Y'all lift my spirits daily.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tony_ganzer Yes! I just shared this one. Turned off location privileges for several smart phone apps after reading the first story.  (And also decided to leave the phone at home during short errands, etc.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RachelDissell Yes, I got pulled into a project.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robincha I saw that. But one was pardoned because he was convicted on paltry evidence. (read waay down in the story)  https://t.co/UiLuW0jD61<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RachelDissell Who exactly are the teams that won? I saw the projects, but not the teams.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dem8z Do you start and end with assessments when teaching? That's a standard practice in K-12, but not in post-secondary. I found they accurately revealed the  student's progress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LangstonReview Jesus!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pineapple_koko @MyaRandle @AmethystMimosa @michaelharriot I would love to read that essay. Please post it on Medium.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ghostofraykroc @michaelharriot Oh lord, LOL. I'd forgotten about that one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cmclymer Yes. I tried to read it, but couldn't get through.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spulliam @bannerite Mine, too. Your tweet sent me to the @washingtonpost site. Good story from a great reporter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had the best #grilledsnapper and #jollofRice yesterday  @Choukouya1 and the salad was lit, too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@natalieymoore Also, what I learned about selectivity filters in communication theory really helped me understand folks like him...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@natalieymoore #BeenThere, LOL. That's why Kuchijagulia is my favorite concept in the Nguzo Saba. I didn't realize that simply speaking is so revolutionary.  (more)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@natalieymoore He probably didn't read it. BUT too many folks think we can only write about race.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lrochellew Girl, let me download TikTok, just for them. Wow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dradambanks Check your message now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tressiemcphd No. I didn't know. #GivenAndReceived<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dradambanks That's apples to oranges. They should compare services at historically Black Protestant churches with services at historically White Protestant churches. The multiple will change, but Black services still last longer than White services. #KnowFromExperience<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanRather @sos_jr Say that! BTW  https://t.co/x3I8xensZL is a great place to start! #AskMeHowIKnow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RachelDissell I'm not surprised. Nozumi is a very good friend of mine. She's always been committed to social justice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonHusted @ODOT_Statewide Love it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks to @LeahRigueur @Musa_alGharbi and @kenblackwell for agreeing to interviews during this busy season. Look for my story on Black Republicans for @USATODAY early next year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimonMagus Constantly! I'm getting my passport filing there. And I log-in to use  https://t.co/hm7mEQrUGl for free!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dem8z If I ever meet you in person, we'll have coffee and prepare notes. It was tough when I was an academic. Students went to the dean abt my grades. So I told them go ahead. But reminded them we wouldn't have this problem IF they'd done their part...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CrookdRiverWmn Thanks for the advice. I'm still looking into this. I plan to speak to my physician at the next visit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gomegmo So I've discovered. I miss talking to folks. You can call me anytime Cuz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robincha I will. These gloomy days in #CLE are killing me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Informative interview with @kenblackwell on Black Republicanism. He predicts #45 will get about 12% of African American vote in 2020 because of growing economy. What say you? (Keep it civil or I will block)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, I just bought an alarm lamp, that wakes you up by simulating sunshine. Puts you to sleep by simulating sunset. I hope it works. #SeasonalAffectiveDisorder has hit already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@natalieymoore That's good to know. I'll get some next time I roll through<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmandaHarnocz All the time, @AmandaHarnocz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tamjeffries So lovely! What a surprise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dem8z I'm looking. I've got my fingers crossed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dem8z It was Ed Bradley. Here's a short clip of him talking about it:  https://t.co/GDWJdO12RK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HannahLebovits It's not because you're Jewish. I'm a devout Christian. We're told the feed the hungry. But these folks make it conditional.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dem8z He always told the truth! You should see him in Hail Hail Rock and Roll!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KVanValkenburg @lordmichaeld "This Christmas" by Donnie Hathaway is the Best Modern Christmas song. Second, William Bell's "Every Day Will Be Like A Holiday." Listen to both on Youtube.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dem8z I had to find this because I've been reading about it all day. Thanks for posting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UndeNIYAble @KidadaEWilliams @MHEducation @Luluwhoo Just went to her page and read the letter! Wow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No more smooth jazz at 107.3 The Wave  https://t.co/gDUF0xqenM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dem8z Hmm. Sounds like me on Weight Watchers looking at that apple pie. I love your niece, LOl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nhannahjones May I add this "The most important work of your life - so far." I am anticipating the work you do in future decades. Not to diminish yr achievement. Just to encourage and motivate. You won't be shut down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichelleButeau Love the line about being cute overwhelmed, not substitute teacher overwhelmed. #FormerSubstituteTeacher.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RachelDissell A former colleague in Mississippi used to do that all the time, LOL. Her yard was gorgeous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ItsTheBrandi @tressiemcphd I feel you, too. Because I see women my age calling younger colleagues "Little Sis." Nope! That's patronizing too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tressiemcphd I'm a Southerner. Auntie was what white folks older Black women. It still rankles, @tressiemcphd. But I also think power plays a role. For me, calling a congress member "Auntie" instead of using her title diminishes her stature.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tressiemcphd Thanks for the insight. Auntie not my favorite term of address. Call me Ms. or by my first name. But Auntie is patronizing. BTW here in Cleveland men are called Unk short for uncle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KateWarrenCLE Okay, lol. Next time, get Marie Callenders or Mrs. Smith. Then lie and say you made it yourself. #MyStrategyForADecade<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@julia_azari I love these threads. You all are making my Thanksgiving Eve fun. (I had a hamburger and glass of wine at the neighborhood bar)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KateWarrenCLE Girl, I quit making pie crust years ago! Only advice, buy any crust but Pet. It sucks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jens_skittles @heyyguido I do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heyyguido @JussDoinqqME Has it been that long? Wow. If you're old, I'm older.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@msgoldsby74 @WEWS No matter their color. Cause the officers who harassed, cursed  and traumatized my nephew were not white.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shorterstory @CarolineMoss I like that one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shannimcg Me: complaining about everything  being out of control Therapist (while winding yarn): No. That's not true. Think about things you can control and work on them.  Me now: Got that advice in 1983. Best advice ever!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reading @LeahRigueur book on #BlackRepublicans  &amp; learned #RalphBunche advocated for universal public health insurance in 1939.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clevelanddotcom if you believe in the stories you are reporting on the anniversary of #TamirRice PULL The. RACIST COMMENTS. @ChrisQuinnOhio You shd do this now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lrochellew The decision on the comments should have come from the top (editor) not the bottom (reporters). The latter can't close comments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lrochellew This goes back to my tweet about the way #LocalMedia cover(s) Tamir Rice's death.  The comments should have been closed, or at least moderated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CrookdRiverWmn Thanks so much for the RT @CrookdRiverWmn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rosadona Please share with me. I'm too stoic for my own good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HannahLebovits My memoir, Claiming Kin: Confronting the History of an African American Family. Should be in local libraries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dem8z Lots of prosecutions in parts of Alabama where sugar in grits is the norm. (Let's not talk about sugar in rice, LOL)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackFreelance1 I think our people need much more education abt ways to invest. We have little access to banks in our communities. And digital inequality keeps us from investing online.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkUrycki Or turned around. I blew up the footage and slowed it down so I cd watch frame by frame. It is hard to see a gun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackFreelance1 Keep me posted on alternatives. I live where homes worth less than $100,000. But I see how the property was passed down to grandchildren, who used it to get on their feet. Wealth building is so difficult for our people. We need alternatives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thischrishorne @SteveGleydura @GChristCLE @jrosietighe @Lrochellew @GeraldineMoriba Thank you! I'm reading her tweets now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thestuartwarner That's a deep sigh...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Suggestions are appreciated. @SteveGleydura @GChristCLE my activists like @jrosietighe and @Lrochellew. You can tell me so I can do better...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soundofideas I went back and looked at coverage -- including mine. And found it lacking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soundofideas I'm specifically talking about the story that blamed Tamir's death on his parents past, instead of the officers' actions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What outlets are doing it right and what outlets aren't doing much at all? And how can that change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How do we cover neighborhoods like Tamir's? Yes, I know about the decline of local news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When it comes to #TamirRice, we #ClevelandJournalists need to look at how we covered his killing and whether we've learned anything in five years. (more)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackFreelance1 If nothing else, we do it for our succeeding generations. Which doesn't mean it is easy to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackFreelance1 I understand. But given the low rates of wealth in our community we have to figure out how to leverage property. Our ancestors placed great store on owning land. I now understand why.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soundofideas We journalists need to discuss how we covered Tamir Rice's death and how coverage of police relations has changed in five years. We bought the police story UNTIL the video emerged..(more)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackFreelance1 I bought my house in 1995. It was the best investment I made. I couldn't become a fulltime freelancer without the house, quite frankly.  BUT, I did not tap into equity and refinanced when advantageous - even while working temp.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidCayJ @nhannahjones @elopezgross @alexi I got hate letters regularly in the mail when I was a columnist. That was in the 90s. I also got voicemails constantly. It's not the medium. It's the person. They take the time because they're hateful.  BTW, my bosses knew.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PenielJoseph I'm trying to get in touch with you for a story on Black Republicans for @USAToday. Could you check your email at @TheLBJSchool? Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jshelat1 I was on the other side when I was a TA in grad school. My students were Jewish. I learned the hard way never to assume. (But a lot of so-called Christians don't know either.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@subbu85 @astrostarbright @iamwill Really. Thx for the info.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TonyaGJPrince Absolutely the truth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeahRigueur @USATODAY Thanks. I'll email you now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HannahLebovits @jrosietighe You get the prize, @HannahLebovits. The reporter said he talked to Blaine Griffin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeahRigueur I'm trying to contact you to request an interview, but can't pull up your website.  Can you send an email to afiscruggs(at)gmail(dot)com. I'm writing for @USATODAY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VLuck @nytimes Thanks so much. I talk to him all the time. I probably just overlooked it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VLuck I'm a reporter in Cleveland. Just read yr article in @nytimes. Can you share info about attempts to limit #dollar stores in Cleveland? This is a new one to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jrosietighe @HannahLebovits Me too! I'm going to email the author and ask for me. I know Brook Park limited thrift stores. But I haven't heard anything else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@papaerrnesto She's 65. We're the same age.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The article mentions Cleveland considering limits on #dollarstores. Anyone heard of this? @HannahLebovits or @jrosietighe?  https://t.co/nlB8hHeM2E<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SceneSallard @andy_geronimo @HannahLebovits @atrubek I'm clueless, cause I didn't get it. I've never figured out what maker means.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeahRigueur @marissaaevans Thanks so much. Dr. Rigueur, I'll send you an email.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TwitterScholars, I'm looking for a source to interview about the history of  #AfricanAmericanRepublicans  Any suggestions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nhannahjones @WesleyLowery I've been dragged by sources and folks I've reported on. That's what I meant when I said it happens to us all the times. We'll have to agree to disagree on this on @nhannahjones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KVanValkenburg Thanks for this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nhannahjones @WesleyLowery But that happens to us journalists all the time. It comes with the territory.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nhannahjones Let me clarify: he was wrong to apologize. His initial decisions were right on target. I don't see race playing a role in the reaction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nhannahjones I can't clap for that one. @WesleyLowery and @nhannahjones.  He was wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbradbabs The students may have been unhappy, but I can't see how they were put at risk, nor why an apology is necessary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbradbabs The Northwestern students were protesting - a public event - in a public space without a reasonable expectation of privacy. They were contacted  based on information in the directory: nothing private there either (more)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealbradbabs I can't accept your reasoning. There are some very good high school and college journalists who are intruding and investigating.  (Yes, I've taught journalism).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tweet_pgblu @merrichristi @thenation Maybe she does. Because the statistic cited comes from 2010. The update comes from 2011. She has a point: the statistic could very well be outdated. But too many articles cite it Without mentioning its age.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thenation That statistic is from 2010. (I know, because I've reported the issue several times.) The update is from 2011. We really need more recent figures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HealthCareHuck @haroldpollack BTW, @haroldpollack, you teach at my alma mater.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HealthCareHuck @haroldpollack You said it before I could, LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSRG_Pubz @TinViking @TerryMetterJr Hold up! Those are my sorority colors. #AKA1908<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TorraineWalker Unless the nation's president hangs out with holocaust deniers. Then knowledge of history is a survival tactic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RachelDissell Looks kinda like kohlrabi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlakeBrodar @TerryMetterJr Me too! But maybe that's cause in live in #CLE216<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks so much @OneManMambo for sending me your new song. It means a lot to know you asked my thoughts. I'll return the favor. Give me a few weeks. #SupportMusicians #Artistslife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HannahLebovits But the city has no identity. It's major retail strip is more than obsolete and longterm (white) residents were complaining about the new "elements" moving in. (Folks like me)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HannahLebovits I disagreed about South Euclid. As a resident, I felt the city needed branding because it has been lost in the shuffle. Now thoughtful development has to accompany the rebranding and I think that's happening. (more)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LawrenceHall105 Let me recomment: I love how all these folks who Graduated From College complain about the irrelevance of a college degree. Maybe it's college for some? Which would explain the cost of a higher education.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LawrenceHall105 Obviously, the OP knows nothing about STEM or STEAM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlesMBlow Yes. If you can get in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@careerconversa1 @AcademicChatter And you will be a much better #Academic for it because you will be able to relate to the world, not just your field. Congrats on your epiphany.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelschaub Not just Generation X.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OneManMambo BTW. I loved 101 Jerusalem. I work with an anti-bigotry project with the @MaltzMuseum. I'm going to show it to my students as inspiration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OneManMambo I watched a mandolinist make magic with my little $79 instrument. That's when I decided not to worry about tools, and worry about musicianship. #ThoughtForTheDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OneManMambo I like Ibanez because the neck fits my hands better. But really, I think the best bass is the one you have at the time. (paraphrasing Cartier Bresson about the best camera).The musician matters more than the instrument...(More)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OneManMambo I don't know, LOL. So far, I've gotten three as gifts. Two are Epiphones and I really like the deep bass sound. Right now, I'm playing with using different strings to get different sounds. What works for you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bcbull And a name as well, LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bcbull Yes she did. #MyFamilyFolkore. I allegedly have a photo of her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonFrazerTV @Lrochellew @jeffsleasman Wow. That's great! Hope I'm still here then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KateWarrenCLE cd you send me a PM with contact info ASAP. I want to do a story abt this today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HannahLebovits Wear a slip under it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Russian_Starr Thanks for posting this. Especially the last about not being divided by false arguments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HannahLebovits Just sent you a PM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffsleasman Yes. That's the elephant in the room, (Sorry about the cliche.) And,it seems the remaining population is heading towards the city's west side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HannahLebovits BTW, I think the first part of your husband's response should be a T-shirt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KapustaDiamond @HannahLebovits I have my ex-husband's grandmother's dishes. I pull them out on holidays so I can eat  dinner with her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelharriot Tussy! You're going waay back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love reading @carolynhax. Her advice is so onpoint - and so bitingly funny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MannyWallace Hahaha to both of you. That's hilarious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zachreed12 I'm writing at story on broadband access in Cleveland neighborhoods and I'd like to talk to you. Could you please send me a message with yr contact info?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlanHogan @BrookeOnAir @journtoolbox @AOC Either way. My mouth was wide open.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrookeOnAir @journtoolbox @AOC I have to watch this again because those last two questions had my mouth on the floor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffsleasman I missed this post. I'm going to check out this book now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B_A_FitzGerald @ShaunaGillooly Have you tried T-spring or Vista Print? Cause I'd buy one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chadloder @ekp @emilychangtv @qz @shaft @habitu8 I'm stealing this one too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chadloder @ekp @emilychangtv @qz @shaft @habitu8 I've been a journalist for decades. I'm sharing this in my groups because upper level managers (and lower level ones) still haven't gotten the message.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chadloder @ekp @emilychangtv @qz @shaft And we have to provide some kind of compensation to those who have been harmed. BTW, I'm not in tech. But WTF is this diversity hinders efficiency mess? That sounds like conformism not innovation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chadloder @ekp @emilychangtv @qz @shaft I understand. I'm just emphasizing this battle against racism - cause that's what it is - demands fighting on multiple fronts. And neither is better than the other. Because We have to 'fix' individuals who are spreading their doctrine (more)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chadloder @ekp @emilychangtv @qz @shaft We can be angry about both the system and the person who is benefitting from it while excusing it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trendchasernews I fell for the click bait unfortunately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tamjeffries Natalie wrote that article.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rzrwiresunrise Yes. I read that and my mouth dropped. #ClichedButTrue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HannahLebovits My sincere condolences<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaggysnod It was truly despicable, especially given the mass shootings plaguely us lately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffsleasman I value your opinion. I worked on writing a clear-eyed article about challenges and solutions. We'll see what actually happens in the neighborhood.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I just saw the anti-journalist video. It came up in my feed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@buggingmetoday @GREG61032 @markmobility @mattdpearce I hate you have to explain this...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tamjeffries No electricity? Nope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlesMBlow My question: Did any of these folks blast the Jean family for forgiving Amber Guyger? #AskingForAFriend, LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wiseacreswest @rgay Me too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andy_chow Was she recruited to collect signatures?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@natalieymoore Which Harold's did you recommend?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HannahLebovits @ClevelandScene Yes. I did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HannahLebovits @ClevelandScene Reading it now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iajunwa It was a good article. I've saved it. Congrats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blackboikei Send a bill. And copyright that curriculum so it can't happen again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LadyV_69 @sladner @SuperWriterMom @cydharrell I learned to type in high school so I could type papers in college.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuperWriterMom But really, it wasn't all y'all are making it out to be. If you want to sew, buy a pattern and follow directions. Freezing is quicker and easier than canning. And no one washes windows.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuperWriterMom We were taught how to set a table, how to plan meals, how to sew. The difference between formal ware and flatware (which I still don't know)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuperWriterMom I'm a Boomer. I took home ec AND honors courses. But really, I didn't learn to sew in home ec. And we were not taught to can in the 60s, nor we were taught to wash windows. (more)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More and more, I understand the meaning of the proverb, "There is no honor among thieves."  What an absolute mess we are in right now. #Syria #Turkey #KurdsBetrayed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennMJack I'm with you sis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaNoriaFilm @TADFilmFest Everyone who can should see this short. I saw it @CIFF last year. It's beautiful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tamjeffries That last line, tho, LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samaaron Just read about @Sonic_Pi. It's an answer to a prayer! #JavascriptBootcampDropOut. Maybe now I'll learn to code - and teach kids to code. Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@devery_mccain @Jax6655 I danced many a night to that song. #80sBaby<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Final finally: You don't have to forgive Amber Guyger just because the Botham's did. If you want to marinate in that stew, go ahead. But please, turn it into constructive action. Let her do her time without you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But our anger about the sentence (cause that's what it's really about, IMHO)  is targeting the family of the victim. We can be angry at the right folks. But we can't let it be destructive. (Okay, this is my column for today)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This situation and reactions to it have prompted me to go back and read #MLK's writings, now that I am more mature. He repeatedly warned us against the toxicity of hatred and cynicism.(more)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is so difficult. Forgiveness doesn't mean wiping away consequences. Or that relationships don't change. Forgiveness isn't reconciliation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But being angry at Jean's family directs hatred to the wrong targets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That doesn't mean Guyger is off the hook. Nor does it mean the family doesn't want the changes; Jean's mother was quite clear about that. (more)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, I'm well aware of the corrosive history of our people and how we have been treated. BUT why are we so angry that Jean's family is forgiving Guyger. (more )<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have short memories in America. So I want to remind folks about the heat Reginald Denny took for forgiving the Black men who brutally beat him during the Rodney King riots. (more)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HannahLebovits Okay. I will if I can remember!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KapustaDiamond thx for the clarification. But even then the getting wasn't good.  At a certain private Ohio school, full time starting salary for an asst prof. was $37,000 at the turn of the 21st century.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LangstonReview But that's how the law works.  We'll just have to wait and see. Like we should have done with the verdict. #IAmGuilty of Jumping to conclusions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LangstonReview I understand the judge allowed it so there would be no basis to raise it in appeal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KapustaDiamond Well that's a generalization isn't it. What about the academics who 1. came from state schools, not Ivies or so-called elite privates? 2. Are adjuncts so they are not only working class but are poor.  Starting salaries in academia are abysmal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KapustaDiamond @drivelikejesu1 He's been there for years!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KapustaDiamond @g_in_cle @ExiledHeroine Dang! This is news! I'm always looking for new places to eat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KapustaDiamond I wondered as well. Although I do like the milkshakes.But I'm lactose intolerant now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today, I learned (again) what "Keep the Faith" means. Hebrew 11:1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tamjeffries Oh wow! RIH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeritLaw Has she at least apologized to his family?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TDCANNInstitute @darreldrowland Right. Like in Florida.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffsleasman It's so she can get off. #Cynic #BeenBlackTooLong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AsiaChloeBrown I had a different interpretation. I thought, quite frankly, it was a protest against gentrification. Especially since the projects were being turned into condos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@learothawms I thought that was Spruce Street. I grew up in that church. We never learned about stuff like this, LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dem8z I am adding that to my set list!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clancynewyork I hope not either. I just don't like the idea of limiting rights to citizens, as they work to overturn the 14th amendment and its guarantee of birthright citizenship - which became necessary because of Taney's ruling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clancynewyork Hmm, sounds like Dred Scott decision doesn't it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suttonimpaQt Don't feel bad. I wouldn't have recognized him either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Russian_Starr One never knows.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bporras1 @eramshaw Oh really? That's why it's Work. Brian Porras.  Employees take up slack for colleagues All. The. Time. Without getting extra. (Some even take up slack for managers.) #nosympathy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darreldrowland What's he waiting for? He could have released at 5:15 today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_meanbean @RedEyesPage @newsone He didn't follow orders either. He had none because he didn't check with his superiors. (That's why I said policy) . And he disregarded the principal who didn't the children arrested. (But the principal wasn't his superior)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CommunitySolsED @modrnhealthcr What will that mean for recipients? Will fewer folks get Medicaid?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Six kids, six colleges. Each kid represents a college. We have a "drumline." We'll come up with a simple routine and perform it. #Music, #Culture and #HigherEducation. Wish me luck, LOL All a part of working for @ClevelandROAM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They learn: the name of the college; the date it was established; its location; school colors: and one famous alumnus(alumna); a<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This fall teaching kids about #HBCU marching band culture.  They'll learn about two of my favs. #SonicBoomOfTheSouth and #TSUAristocratofBands<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedEyesPage @newsone He didn't follow policy at all. That's why he's gone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tamjeffries remember that story I wrote on Blacks and body image when you were at #Essence? I think it needs another look.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gomegmo It hit home. The same thing is happening in Nashville. The issue isn't just gentrification. It's  respect for culture.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gomegmo I cried reading that article.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@offbeatorbit Oh thank you! I loved that photo because it reminded me of my sister's first grade pix.  We are so oppressed when it comes to hair and appearance. (Remember Gabby Douglas and Simone Biles excoriated because of their edges after winning gold in 2016)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I get discouraged -which is a lot these days, I remember Hebrews 11:1. Especially the part about "evidence of things unseen."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need to think about this for the rest of my life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@learothawms OMG! I could write a book. Thank God for @UChicago. I learned how to buckle down there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffsleasman Yea, I know. I got a laugh out of that one. No one walks in America. If we did, we wouldn't even consider scooters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bluefunk2020 Do you talk about how it was an inappropriate word because it sounded like the F-word? When I was a kid, saying something was funky would get your mouth washed with soap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harryallen Apparently he arrested 2 kids that day. He's been suspended.  https://t.co/KtSP1aHcfI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rabiasquared I applied for a job with that institute several years ago. I'm amazed at this latest turn of events.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@learothawms You're welcome. I want to say it was on Division Street, but I'm not sure. I attended Wharton Elementary in 1963, and the siblings were classmates of mine. That might help some?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@learothawms There was an African American orphanage until the 60s if I recall. I knew a pair of siblings who lived there. Don't remember the name of the place, though. Cd it be the same one?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tjweastfalls @sairasameerarao Not at that time, no. In fact, black women suffragists were pushed out of the movement. White women argued suffrage would solidify white supremacy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KapustaDiamond #LoveIsWhatItDoes . I saw that motto in a church decades ago. I've never forgotten. It's not your problem. But #Love, ya know? Bless you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lordganesh @bethanyshondark @AviSmolen I went to college in the 70s.  I went to college  parties in the 70s. Trust me, the guys didn't walk around with their penises exposed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tamjeffries Yep. Unfortunately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nigeramin Which is why Black neighborhoods are disappearing at a phenomenal rate in my hometown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@No10oX @DrRJKavanagh Yep. That was buried in the  story. But her coaches made that point - and stood up for her!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KapustaDiamond Yep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KapustaDiamond @jeffsleasman Hmm. I noticed The wait staff were African American, but they could have been better prepared.  However, this restaurant is a start up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KapustaDiamond I agree with you. When I went there,  I noticed this West African restaurant actually had West African diners. So maybe the target clientele ALREADY knows what's up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HannahLebovits Yeah, unfortunately. That is one reason I left academia so long ago. I felt so powerless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darreldrowland So private schools, then? What does he .mean Faith-Based HBCUs?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lrochellew Christopher Columbus conversations. That's a new one. I'm stealing it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HannahLebovits Actually, Hannah I did exactly what she suggested. I got two adjunct positions. #Desperation works sometimes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattferderer @verizon Well, let's see whether my fix worked. If not, I'll be right back here. But the hoops I had to jump through to talk to a person are incredible!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mattferderer I'm right here with you! Between this and the terrible website I'm not a happy camper right now. @verizon<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TonyaGJPrince @JoelleMonique Let me know what you think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoelleMonique @TonyaGJPrince That reply was snappy. I read his NYTimes article, as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lrochellew Thanks @Lrochellew! Your words have me tearing up! Really.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@XavierDLeau I filled out a form with my interests. They recommended about 5 -10 possible colleges. I got applications with fees waived. I ended up at @UChicago. (Only we called it the UofC, then)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@XavierDLeau You wrote your essay on paper. You mailed it in. You waited for a letter. You read it. As "Negro" student, I was part of a the National Referral Service for Negro Students (more)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@XavierDLeau I applied in 1971. You talked to your guidance counselors, who had received information from the school. They catalogs and sometimes applications. If not you mailed the admission office and asked for one.  Then you filled it out on paper. (more)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is major! Thank goodness.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bluefunk2020 @LangstonReview A tragic end, according to the story and others. Bell was broke and extremely ill.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@eroccdotnet @KapustaDiamond Let me explain why I try so hard @eroccdotnet. When I was researching my family I looked at lists of wedding licenses from back in the day. The names of African Americans were spelled any ole kinda way. The names of whites, not so much (more)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RevJacquiLewis Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RevJacquiLewis Is this true, or is it dubbed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KapustaDiamond Yep.  Because those folks didn't matter. Especially if they were Italian or Eastern European.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eroccdotnet @KapustaDiamond But journalists were supposed to get it right. The nonchalance about names reveals how society views certain folks.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dem8z I'm glad. LOL. I almost deleted the tweet. I thought it might be disrespectful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dem8z Yes! "Look at that girl shake that thang, We can't all be Martin Luther King."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DianeOhiodiane @neeratanden He did apologize for his response, though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Al_Edee @ThePlainDealer I understand. But they have less than 30 folks in their newsroom now. I'll leave that right there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a local news advocate I'm happy. But given the state of local news staff, I'm saddened.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LauraMcShaneCLE @jrosietighe @Nextdoor @Forbes @CitizenApp @BigMike052 I appreciate your sincerity. But frankly, the person who pushed me off was the moderator. I thought/think there are better ways for me work with my community and neighborhood. #NoSnark<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LauraMcShaneCLE @jrosietighe @Nextdoor @Forbes @CitizenApp @BigMike052 Well, my experience had nothing to do with police safety @LauraMcShaneCLE and everything to do with the language the posters used when discussing Black youth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jrosietighe Following as well. I got off my community's NextDoor after the moderator deleted my post decrying the racism there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GermainLussier Nope. I can read in less time than it takes to watch the video. #WeAreGood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidAstinWalsh @profmusgrave Interestingly, just produced two segments for @WCPN about the area's mass transit problems. And I agree about #publicspaces.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CLEforTransit Thx to all who retweeted and commented. Even my Boo at home had much to say about RTA. #Transit can really make or break a city.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DoctaPhatstaxx @LouBHal @dhmontgomery @CityLab Whoa, I take it back, LOL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffsleasman Nashville needs transit policies, especially ones that benefit the less affluent residents who are barely living there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouBHal @DoctaPhatstaxx @dhmontgomery @CityLab To all y'all. I checked with some Pittsburgh friends. I stand corrected. #YouWereaAbsolutelyRight #YouWereRightAllAlong #YouWereAbsolutelyRight #AndImWrong.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DoctaPhatstaxx @LouBHal @dhmontgomery @CityLab Well some of Ohio is Appalachia. But that part is much closer to the Ohio River than Pittsburgh is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouBHal @DoctaPhatstaxx @dhmontgomery @CityLab @atrubek, what do you say about #RustBelt and #Midwest?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoctaPhatstaxx @dhmontgomery @CityLab What? You didn't mention the competition with Cleveland, right, LOL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoctaPhatstaxx @dhmontgomery @CityLab I do. I live in Cleveland. Pittsburgh is our rival.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MickiMaynard @dhmontgomery @CityLab I agree with you. Folks forget/don't know how close Pittsburgh is to Ohio.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Whooping_Jane @dhmontgomery @CityLab #Pittsburgh is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@newroolz @JeffSierp @Agreed. And I live in #Cleveland, LOL. But #Nashville!?! #Louisville?!? Not! I grew up in Nashville. It's South for sho'<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@alexbaca @25 The develop or die dichotomy posited in Litt's article seems reductive.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@alexbaca The neighborhood is being revitalized out of existence, IMHO. And I understand the irony of an African-American woman making that statement without being snarky.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexbaca Are there other ways to "revitalize" neighborhoods rather than building complexes that folks who live in the in the community can't afford? The opponents aren't necessarily short- sighted. Gentrification is real.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Reporting and writing this story really lifted my spirits. Best wishes to @sampoetry127 for this project.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dradambanks @alexmejia It was in Mayfield Heights outside Cleveland.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@INNamplify thanks for adding me to the list of Ohio Journalists. Please add @OPinfo as well.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CoreyMiles__ @dem8z Me too, but, frugality has its virtues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes! Thanks to @KidadaEWilliams for making this point. Juneteenth was one of several ceremonies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KidadaEWilliams Oh thanks so much for this tweet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tamjeffries I need to see some evidence for that claim.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamilSmith @facebook Exactly. But this isn't about news. It's about integrity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RevDrBarber Since I belong to the media, I'll work on taking your advice. #NoSnark<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff Just when you think there's no where else to fall...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks @Vox for this history of #PompAndCircumstance.  I have to learn to play it for a graduation.  Its history includes @UChicago,  my #almamater  https://t.co/zuBdXqZXec<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GChristCLE I wanna know too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is insane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sifill_LDF I don't get it either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tamjeffries @KeonteColeman @meredithdclark @TriadABJ Wow! He was ROFL when he was writing, I promise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dem8z Just goes to show how prolific you are. If it makes you feel better, #SmokeyRobinson said the same thing when he was honored at the Rock Hall, LOL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Russian_Starr @michaelharriot I thought he did too. Did I fall for a lie?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bandele_abenaa @ATLBlackStar It was a great blog. I miss it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog Because not everyone has a car. And not all cities are crowded. I live in an inner ring suburb. I have green grass, trees, open space and deer. Walking down the middle of my street and chillin in my yard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pkalina @atrubek @daveweigel @SenSherrodBrown That's why liberals  cite it. It's not a given anymore, especially now that African American turnout has fallen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ATLBlackStar This one was one of the best blogs I'd seen on this topic. Unfortunately, it's been gone since 2014. But her book is still available.  https://t.co/wioyLsOe2G<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankConniff How about the womens' movement,  gay rights and even hiphop? (Cause Kool Herc is a boomer, believe it or not.) Really, though can we stop with the generation gap stuff? It's not relevant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytimes @jeffsleasman we were just talking about this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. #Overlooked.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@megan1996 @DemeterTresa @Maggie_Klaus @VABVOX @JoeBiden I'm trying to find the announcement of his campaign song. Where did you hear about it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@megan1996 @DemeterTresa @Maggie_Klaus @VABVOX @JoeBiden The point is you're assuming he doesn't realize that. Maybe he does and understands it speaks to today's conditions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimHerrera I'm still working on releasing my grudge(s). I understand I'm halfway there. But thanks for your article. It really helps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lrochellew I feel you. I did that when 1. my bay window was replaced and 2. when the electric sockets were updated, LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're in Cleveland... Foluke is wonderful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrubek @daveweigel Yep, lol. And liberals cite is as the county they need to win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tinypatron @PacificStand Here you are. My take on this issue from  back in 2013. (One of my ancestors was part of a trust fund. Another was part of a dowery)  https://t.co/Qg43G2i6Xb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CrookdRiverWmn @ClevelandClinic I worked as a temp during that time. I saw folks  bringing in sodas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CrookdRiverWmn How did the experiment with sugar-free colas go at Cleveland Clinic? I think that experience  would be instructive to us all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ROAM_arts_edu @CleveFoundation Love the vests!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrubek I did that the first time. I had two choices: New York City or Kansas City. I was in Chicago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dradambanks Check out Jay Cee  from Auburn on Facebook. His thread on this is hilarious! "What would your dissertation title be if related to Black culture (satirical)"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClevelandScene Just fourth?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mariazmess @RBraceySherman @Lrochellew @Alyssa_Milano Thanks for clarifying.  I have to agree with her, there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mariazmess @RBraceySherman @Lrochellew @Alyssa_Milano To answer your question, @Mariazmess No. Because I'm prochoice, I do not regret my abortions.  #IfYouDontWantAnAbortion #DontHaveOne.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffsleasman Okay. But if we fund it that way, then  the money eventually decreases. Like what's happening to the arts in Cuyahoga County. What is the alternative then? #NotDebating #JustDiscussing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoreyMiles__ I appreciate that he asked you for guidance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LEXorTODD @CoreyMiles__ THanks. Me neither.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffsleasman But regressive. Cause the folks who will be most affected live in neighborhoods with contaminated houses and few if any groceries.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_Peggy_7 What happens if you Become poor?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dem8z I still have my copy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dem8z I had both of her books. They're long gone, unfortunately.  But I still have a hardback edition of White Rat, as well as the reissue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally, you're being heard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RHamilton44 @dem8z You won't be sorry! If you find Alice Childress, please tag me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dem8z @dradambanks They're great books. I read: Alice Childress, Octavia Butler, and Ann Petry. I still have the  last two.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@margbern Wow, thank you so much. But thank @digitalsista who has been raising the alarm for months!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@learothawms I go whenever I come to Nashville, actually. I just heard the big house on the corner was burned. Send me a message with your contact info and I'll connect you with my brother. He'd love to talk about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@learothawms My family bought a house on Arthur Ave. in the 1940s. I've wondered how they did that. The neighborhood was white, then black and now becoming white again.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tamjeffries Hahahaha, right! @Tamjeffries @shotbyniyah,  Hard work and God. Wins every time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iSmashFizzle They turned it down because they said it would be too difficult to apply funds to individual accounts.  (Instead of just dividing the money evenly so everyone got a reprieve.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@loquaciouslisa1 @beyoncefused Yes he did!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gomegmo Fetuses. Cause they definitely don't care about kids, based on other legislation I see coming out. (Yep, in Ohio, too!)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clmorse20 @RogueNASA Yep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@V_Carlson @RogueNASA I wondered that. Especially since the district declined a donation to pay off the debts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BopStopTMS NO, NO, NO! @BopStopTMS  The n'goni is  not the African banjo! The banjo is the American n'goni! (according to some)  #AfricaCameFirst #slavery @RhiannonGiddens plz weigh in!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@scifi_kunal @backlon Thanks. I've got a good external mic, actually.  Just needs a headphone jack. (Which is why I want the Pixel 3).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jessdimson @danamo @NYTmag I saw it. It was beautiful<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dradambanks @elb3 All the way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DT58EFC @annacod @LABLiverpool Sigh.  I'm not disparaging freelancers either. I'm bitter abut finance department devaluing small business owners. That's all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you love #Blues, please follow me on Spotify. Tag me on Twitter and I'll follow you too.  https://t.co/vJ2FZzOLxB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DT58EFC @annacod @LABLiverpool Let me point out that many of us do act like businesses and help ourselves. If we are businesses, then we should be treated like businesses, especially if our product and practices are stellar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benphillips76 I will<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BluetonedBoy @annacod @AlohaLolaCards #CashFlow is why I became a musician. After a gig, I take the money home instead of waiting for two weeks. (If I'm lucky)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DT58EFC @annacod Uhhm, I don't think that's the point. The point is, treat freelancers better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tamjeffries @KeonteColeman @mediaghosts @RhondaVSharpe Yes it does. That's why I say let's talk honestly, without relying on slogans.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rosadona Sexism. Plain and simple. Like a woman can't be an outstanding athlete and have a deep(er) voice and be muscular. (And racism, too, IMHO)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachelbianca Or the times an editor kept trying to send me to the features department, when I was assigned to a county bureau. (No matter how many times I corrected him).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachelbianca Like the time my boss when to the supervisor of the other Black woman and told him his employee was unhappy with her job. Caused big problems for her! I was the unhappy one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GWforumLakers @rachelbianca Nope. It doesn't happen to everyone like it happens to People of Color. #AskMeHowIKnow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nicole80017 @AriBerman In a nutshell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chezrebellion I love this story. So many folks laugh at #GeorgeWashingtonCarver as a #BHM trope. Thanks for sharing how his struggle touched a life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlesMBlow I can't afford $800 for a stove. That's two mortgage payments. But gas is on the way  out. Folks don't want to  fool with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Natalie26487725 I wondered myself. I also wondered what would have been the outcome if she had been, say German.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Clevecarole I am thrilled for you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chezrebellion I'm not surprised at that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I thought #Watergate was amazing. #BarrHearing is stunning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mediaghosts @tamjeffries @RhondaVSharpe @KeonteColeman @SherriWrites @meredithdclark I agree. But we need to talk honestly about it, especially when it comes to pay and cash flow issues. Simply put, how do you support yourself. All my journalist friends have moved to #contentmarketing, #corporatecommunications, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alice_Wilder Yep. I need her to be my friend!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MsAlissa_J @BlackGirlGroup I agree. I'm very blunt about the reality of freelancing.  Also, #healthinsurance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackGirlGroup Because you can barely make a living freelancing. #DoingFor20Years. Because you're constantly pitching. Because you wait several weeks to get paid... Should I go on?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RachelDissell @CLASHcle The framework was in place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RachelDissell @CLASHcle I still do not understand why #ClevelandCItyCouncil didn't work with @CLASHcle  to modify the proposed ordinance back in 2017 or even more recently<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RachelDissell @CLASHcle The major point in @CLASHcle ordinance was requiring landlords to inspect housing before renting and fining them for non-compliance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks to @RachelDissell for breaking story of Lead Safe Cleveland Coalition's  policy recommendations. After a quick read-thru, I don't see much, if any, difference between their policy and @CLASHcle ordinance. Please correct me if I'm wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking into the  difference between LEAD Safe Cleveland and  those of CLASH  Lead Safe Cleveland coalition recommendations head to Cleveland City Council  https://t.co/w2gj4ekfex<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Clevecarole @belt_magazine @BELTMagazine Thanks for reading and commenting. This situation is so complicated. But bottom line, the issue is #CleanUpLead. The machinations have me shaking my head.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lrochellew I love #BAPS. I will be watching.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cleveland is not the only city with a #lead poisoned housing. But its reluctance to solve it is more than puzzling. Thx to @BeltMagazine for allowing me to write about this important issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UROCKlive1 You're honest. Here's mine. I wish folks would respect wisdom, age and insight into how to fight dirty. Cause candidates of the future have no clue.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@belt_publishing congrats on the @NPR  review of #RadicalSuburbs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WritersofColor  I hope this pans out. I write for this publication. They're serious and meaningful. Give them a pitch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have #musicmerch. I have a #squarereader. I'm now a real #businesswoman. #growingmybusiness is a journey I'd never thought I'd start. But here I am.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KapustaDiamond Thanks for sharing this. It's the pep talk I needed today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@forcvnp @amythystkiah @GLTFCleveland @ClevePOPSOhio @amythystkiah I am so pumped to see you. Hope to meet you personally &amp; connect. I am a #bassplayer and play #OldTime. #GotMyTicket.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy Birthday to #BeverlyCleary, author of the famous #HenryHuggins books. She is one of the reasons I eventually became a #writer #TeachYourKidsToRead. #KeepsEmBusy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrubek @belt_magazine @thischrishorne @annaleighclark @ryan_schnurr @marcusgilmer @jbenton @dansinker @marthabayne I'd seen this and was thinking about you all. I'll be in touch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mims Mine was a Tandy that ran DOS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to try this in church on Sunday, lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheAtlantic @JohnHMcWhorter Wait, #JohnHMcWhorter is taking up for Black people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QueenieG2017 @bannerite Did you see the @Politico column by his uncle? SMDH  https://t.co/fsIDHJHQZW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bevandton @Nmrosetx611 @NPR Obama did not separate families as blanket policy. Nor use kids as bargaining chips to deport parents. Nor lose records so thousands of kids are missing/unaccounted for.  I'm #ProudofUSA when we have morals. We don't anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@natalieymoore You need to save these and show them to her when she is older.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can not get over #CandaceOwens. Does she know anything about African American history? Anything at all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SocialPowerOne1 They didn't have to ask for Bushes either. (Both of them)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marlenetaylor48 Yes. I saw that. Congrats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@learothawms What you said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ttownmike My niece just posted this on her Facebook page.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ttownmike @KosherSoul Tell me about it. I grew up in North Nashville. Nothing from my childhood is left.  I've met (white) people from Nashville who talk about not being able to live there anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SceneSallard @schmangee #Crime makes money. There are no follows anymore. It's all spot news, if that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SceneSallard I've turned into M'Dear. This is simply unbelievable. But there's no nice way to say what he's admitting: Not enough folks to do a decent job.  https://t.co/WVXYpRd5HH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sandylocks Reconstruction is the most tragic era of AfricanAmerican history, for me. So many gains that were wiped out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gomegmo @natalieymoore You all know how Zola is. She'll go to #UChicago like her favorite cousin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@julito77 @billmaher @JulianCastro @Maher is not a liberal. Go back about 20 years and check out what he said about Muslims.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YNB @RoleMyDice That was my first thought, LOL. And then Guurll, Lemme tell you what happened...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kyletalking I know him. We worked together. But that's not my dearest memory. It was when he was one of about 4 people at a co-worker's mother's funeral. #classact<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LilNasX I love the banjo. That's the best part. #NashvilleBred #NotThatScruggsTho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TiffanyDCross I wish folks would read Dr. Kings speeches before saying what he would do. (Or better, maybe talk to his children?)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gomegmo And Queen Latifah, LOl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClevelandScene Thoughtful column. Too bad folks aren't listening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soledadobrien Insights like that are why I'm so happy to follow you on twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SheehanHannan @atrubek @SceneSallard @RachelDissell @HenryJGomez @NickCastele @ramccafferty @anniezaleski @DrKenSchneck Thanks for the mention. But I'll talk long and hard about doing freelance local hard news when local outlets are few and far between.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gomegmo I know. I wonder, what and how he did as the Fed Chair in Kansas City?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClevelandWard5 @nprmusic I beat you. Tyrone Davis, LOL. I was a kid. I do not know why I went to see Tyrone Davis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dradambanks Hahaha. It's my new drip!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dradambanks  https://t.co/3zKAkkofBL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robincha @IrshadManji I'll share the link. It was streamed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks so much for this wonderful opportunity to converse with such a provocative author in such a civic minded venue. @IrshadManji really has me thinking about how I listen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ET1062 @ByRosenberg @EdwerderRFA It's not the media platform. It's the bodies and the time. Both of which mean money no matter where the content is published.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MsPackyetti Yes, @MarcoWerman mentioned that fact today. #BlackWomen have to work until August. #LatinxWomen have to work until November. So don't despair. #YouHaveBeenHeard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrshadManji @TheCityClub Thanks for the retweet. I'm working on my questions now! See you on Wednesday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrubek Tell me about it.  No outlets at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dmansworld474 @ThePlainDealer I'm sorry to hear this. But my best wishes for you are sincere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamShaneMorris @LilNasX well look how long it took for #DefordBailey to be inducted into the country music hall of fame. And he was an original member of the Grand Ole Opry. #BlackPeopleinCountryMusic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YMHall Opening day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the first time in my adult life, I've filed taxes before 4/1!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@natalieymoore Chicken thighs stewed in homemade tomato sauce with raisins over spiced cauliflower rice. No bacon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sanbishop I just happened to look outside.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KapustaDiamond OMG, you remember that too? I wish there was something like that again as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KapustaDiamond This is so great! He's been there for almost 25 years. I'm so  glad he's gotten this recognition. I used to go to bluegrass/oldtime music jams there. Now he has brunch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaNoriaFilm was a favorite of mine tonight at @CIFF! The ending left me melancholy. #VerySurprising #NoSpoiler.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tatecurtis @JournalistsLike Yes. More advice for young reporters: Don't sleep on the #StormSewerStory. It's dull but soo important. As are #SchoolLevies, #LocalIncomeTaxes, #ZoningBoards. They determine local quality of life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheCityClub @CIFF @decadeoffire @jrosietighe @iamjenlumpkin Thx to @TheCityClub &amp; @CIFF  for the opportunity. @decadeoffire was thought-provoking, challenging my view of the #SouthBronx. So glad to live in Cleveland where intelligent discussions of #urbanpolicy and #urbanplanning are always front and center.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vkrueger I think a lot of Christians don't know much about Christianity. Like Easter is the most important holiday of the religion, not Christmas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IlhanMN OMG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eirelandforever @RedTRaccoon @LisetteFahrun You win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jackieleigh92 Missed it. Needed to have a clothes dryer installed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cindylgeorge It probably wasn't. But....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are such cuts justified or not? In any case, what's the local fallout? You need #full-time #reporters  (i.e. folks who can make a living wage) to write these kinds of stories.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Folks cap on "the media" without realizing good journalism is so, so much more than politics. Money for American History and Civics Education. Gone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Coverage like this is why #LocalNewsMatters. Innovative Approaches to Literacy money: gone. That's dollars for local schools and libraries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If local news outlets weren't gutted, this is a great follow: what cuts affect yr towns &amp; cities? What will hurt? What won't? But we don't have newspapers/outlets doing this kind of story much anymore...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Arts in education funding: gone. Education dollars for Promise Neighborhods: gone. Javis Gifted and Talented dollars: gone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While y'all concerned about Special Olympics losing its Dept. of E  funding (&amp; rightfully so) take a look at all 29 education programs on the chopping block.  https://t.co/yxFF8Fbp4l<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cindylgeorge My family didn't use it for a loong time. A great-uncle died as an infant after my g-grandma used Vicks. She blamed herself for ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@3_r1c Unfortunately, proll'y not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@damemagazine I'm a subscriber. I'm a reporter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gomegmo I thought about you when I read it, actually. I won't tell your dad!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fieldandfen Well, @Catlover9555 do some research on the anti-litter awareness and #LadyBirdJohnsons beautification campaigns of the 60s. We were taught to respect our surroundings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fieldandfen @viet_t_nguyen How about boy musician since I'm a "girl musician". Even tho I'm 64.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@karinchenoweth @viet_t_nguyen Yes, of course it would be fair and accurate. #ChinuaAchebe's work is grounded in his culture while transcending it. So is #ErnerstHemingway's. Let's call #Conrad a Polish author writing about Africa.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrubek So glad you got someone to write about this. I'm still disappointed my queries yielded nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tony_ganzer @bcbull You never saw the one that lived around Forest Hill near Superior? I had kids write a song about that bird. It was a fixture until it got hit. #BackIn2009<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamilahLemieux You should talk to folks over 60. Their dates smell like tree as well. #AskMeHowIKnow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BonafideTye Thanks for the reminder. I didn't see it. But your story has me #inspired to do better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dradambanks First of the Month, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@femalep SCOTUS was the reason I voted for Hillary.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LrgAsh @jfreewright The cop didn't follow protocol: pull up a safe distance away; cover himself with the car door, crouch and warn Tamir to put gun down. The cop jumped out the car and fired. 1-2 seconds.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LrgAsh @jfreewright No. He didn't. #TamirRice was killed  less than 2 seconds after the cops rolled up.  I watched the tape. Too many times. Slowed down..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EstOdek I wanted to be a #musician. I finally made it after becoming a #SlavicLinguist and a #Journalist/#Writer/#Author<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now this is what I'm talking about!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlesMBlow Yeah. Then (re)read Margaret Walker's Jubilee. It's a great antidote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClaymoreKwaram1 @gomegmo @nytimes @gomegmo is my cousin. That's why I asked, just to make sure. It may have been obvious to you, but not to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gomegmo @nytimes Did you know him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CLASHcle @CityofCleveland Where are you finding those stats?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CharlesMBlow Actually, I kinda agree with her. And also, after Trump, Pence. Who scares me much, much more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BandLab Thanks. Everything is smooth sailing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffsleasman I'm glad you know about Petry. She's so overlooked.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BandLab_music I need to return my Link analog. I've sent 2 emails with no response. Can we talk? Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joncoopertweets I love the irony of this comparison: "Now, in a move reminiscent of the “Green Book” guide that listed safe establishments for African-American motorists in the South..."<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bjcolangelo @SceneSallard Sorry to hear this, but I can relate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YMHall I don't even want to know.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@annhoff @Slate Good point. What was the answer?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have to retweet this. Because I'm seeing the same bigotry. Only the targets have changed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CharlesMBlow Depends on what part of the South you're from. It's a simple as that, really.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@therealmohameds @NPRCodeSwitch Don't you just love it<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jarberwok @mcahalane @Russian_Starr @amandablount2 @RashidaTlaib That **Ssh happens all the time. #AskMeHowIKnow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jarberwok @mcahalane @Russian_Starr @amandablount2 @RashidaTlaib She left without being allowed to speak. That is open her mouth and give her own opinion. Without having someone speak for her. That's what I'm saying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jarberwok @mcahalane @Russian_Starr @amandablount2 @RashidaTlaib We have done the latter, actually. He used a Black woman because he  introducing her statement without even asking her to speak for herself. She was a prop.

<|startoftext|>@Lrochellew Thank you. I don't know how I missed this one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanECHamm @SceneSallard Me too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickCastele @SceneSallard @PressClubCle Me too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lrochellew I didn't know this at all! Is it because our median income is so low? Is this another indicator of #IncomeInequality? Is it regional?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SceneSallard @PressClubCle And secondly, how about a panel on building audiences in the age of AI? How do we journos, PR folks etc.  work with and against algorithms that steer content?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SceneSallard @PressClubCle Most definitely! Thanks for letting us know. First off, let's have events at venues owned by #POC. I can recommend a couple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewBlackMan My book of knitting essays was released in 2003. Even then we #KnittersofColor complained there were no #POCmodels in the knitting magazines.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewBlackMan I was with the article until the author restated the #Grandma stereotype.  The knitting boom actually started about 25 years ago. But the book that help launch it had the #NotYrGrandmothersKnitting as a PR hook. The ageism still stick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amy_Siskind Unfortunately. After all, Clinton/Lewinsky wasn't even 25 years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@natalieymoore I had measles, mumps, chicken pox. I'd hope to belong to the last American generation to suffer those illnesses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Clevecarole No, Driving Miss Daisy won that year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrubek You mean Afi or Scruggs, LOL? Don't know anyone famous named Afi. And the Scruggses that are famous are men.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thepbg @dradambanks Oops, I forgot Barney Miller! #BassPlayersDreamSong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thepbg @dradambanks Theme from The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd; Courtship of Eddie's Father,  Taxi. Night Court, should I go on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TdoubleB Yes it is. Plus Alexa contacts your friends while you're gossiping about them. So no, she can't come to my house.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Midwest or Midwest adjacent like #Louisville or #FtWayne perhaps. Got a project in mind? Pitch it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eirelandforever @Amy_Siskind @BerniceKing You are welcome. It was quite a poignant article and I thought about our discussion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonyaajw @thedailybeast Say that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eirelandforever @Amy_Siskind @BerniceKing Now we know  https://t.co/DLM0O02CL3<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@eirelandforever @Amy_Siskind @BerniceKing Ask her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eirelandforever @Amy_Siskind Why don't you ask @BerniceKing what her father would have done. She'd know better than you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KStreetHipster @holtchesley Still, that's not a basis for arrest. If there was no physical violence. I've seen much worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KStreetHipster @holtchesley Being around kids in the classroom makes a big difference. She could have called the principal or had him escorted to the office if he was being disruptive. That's what usually is done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sumbodysbabygrl @KStreetHipster This right here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KStreetHipster @holtchesley @KStreetHipster  do you teach? Do you work with children at all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KStreetHipster @KobiTirey I read it.  What I would have done is: continue the pledge; turn my back to the kid; use it as a teachable moment. (Why say the pledge? What is free speech)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clhubes Except "Babe" was a contender but Denzel Washington was snubbed that year.  So yes. It's a talking pig movie as far as I'm concerned.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SugarCatDancer @NPR Finally, you're making assumptions about me based on stereotypes. e.g. my "poor choices." That is an example of how racism and bias work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SugarCatDancer @NPR Dr. King talked about economic discrimination as well, especially toward the end of his life. That is why he was in Memphis in the first place: supporting the garbage workers strike.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SugarCatDancer @NPR The wage gap between whites and blacks has been well documented. So those are three examples I can cite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SugarCatDancer @NPR The late Devah Pager proved that it is easier for a white male ex-felon to get a job than for a black male with a college degree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SugarCatDancer @NPR First of all there's ample evidence that white people get better finance rates for mortgages and cars, even when controlling for income.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SugarCatDancer @NPR Sir/Madam, I have a #PhD, an #MA and a #BS. I teach grades k-college and I'm an award winning writer. My father joined the military so his children would not have too. I'm not blaming others. Institutional racism is real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SugarCatDancer @NPR No I don't have the same opportunity as you. #InstitutionalizedRacism is real.  Dr. King spoke repeatedly about that inequity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SugarCatDancer @NPR Choices, but not opportunities nor access. That's the crucial difference. And Dr. King's fight wasn't about individual choice as much as folks want it to be. It was about access.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SugarCatDancer @NPR Did you overlook this part: "It is obvious today that America has defaulted on its promissory note as far as citizens of color were concerned?" Or King calling for a "Marshall Plan for America's ghettos?" (that's affirmative action)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobFarberJr @NPR My mother was raised by my grandmother who was a teenaged mother. My mom graduated from college in 1952. My grandmother in 1956. Every one in our family  has graduated from college since.  #NoSnark<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@k2h05 @NPR Race is (which doesn't mean it doesn't matter, actually.) But culture isn't.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@washingtonpost Glad to see Pai mentions infrastructure. But sorry to see he turns to loosening regulations. Companies need a kick to finally improve inner-city and rural communities they've neglected. I'm skeptical that deregulation will incentivize them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChaddieBistro @LauraMcShaneCLE  That is The question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChaddieBistro @LauraMcShaneCLE Suburbanization began earlier. My neighborhood in SEuclid was Jewish. The house was built in 1954.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChaddieBistro @LauraMcShaneCLE Neighborhoods became Black as Jews moved out. e.g. #Glenville. #OwningRace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChaddieBistro @LauraMcShaneCLE  Remember there were 2 #greatmigrations. I'm reading Kusmer's book on Black Cleveland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LauraMcShaneCLE @ChaddieBistro Heights was off limits to Jews and ethnic whites as well. #OwningRace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those designations were also coded. For example came hard &amp; slowly to Shaker Heights. #OwningRace  https://t.co/fdmBQPDsng<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChaddieBistro @LauraMcShaneCLE Dichtomy is historic &amp; intentional as explained here:  https://t.co/2VeQxysVvz #OwningRace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChaddieBistro @LauraMcShaneCLE Finally, African Americans are concentrated on East side in Cleveland &amp; suburbs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChaddieBistro @LauraMcShaneCLE Also, Puerto Rican families settled on the East Side and moved after Hough in the 60s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChaddieBistro @LauraMcShaneCLE I would agree except for history of restrictive covenants &amp; racial segregation...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@LauraMcShaneCLE @WCPN Plz give an example. Thx. #OwningRace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WCPN wrote a story abt that issue for @ClevelandMag #OwningRace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChaddieBistro what abt the festival in Luke Easter Park? And the late great Glenville Fest? Or New Daybin Hough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChaddieBistro please explain. I have been living on Eastside 22 years. Have never heard those terms. #owningrace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks @momsamango  https://t.co/j94fml2fLl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did @nbc really take down videos of Trump/Fallon from Youtube? Every link I follow says the content has been removed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So when we talk about #OwningRace, let's talk about intraracial #diversity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because the Black/White dichotomy is outdated and outmoded #OwningRace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally, when do we move beyond discussions to action? That is, if we're serious about #OwningRace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In fact, I'm beginning to think neighborhoods and suburbs are CleveLand's version of #identitypolitics #OwningRace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lived in Cleveland area since 1994. Still can't get over how East/West Side is shorthand for Black/White #owningrace<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I shd be hearing from Bill in my email right about now....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like sermons, especially when I agree with the preacher. #DNC2012<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>.@chucktodd, why is the MSM tripping over the length of the speech? He's got the crowd in his palm. #imareportertoo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hear #Clinton on #welfare. I read the memo #DNC2012 #don'tneedtofactcheckthis. I already did.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Back from #ASJA2012. Trying to decompress &amp; use what I've learned. First step: new profile pix. Tell me: like it? Or not?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another tip: curate your timeline on facebook. What was public is now super public @sree #sreetips #asja2012<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmm, this from  @sree: kill the bizpage on #facebook and only use privatepage.  BUT Have to decide when to make updates public<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now @sree is explaining how to use #facebook. Including that timeline. #asja2012 #sreetips<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love this idea: communities can establish conventions for hashtags. Example: #audreyhepburn or #ahepburn? #sreetips #asja2012 @sree<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So now I'll write like this: Hey @sree is saying  to spread the word about something, move @ into the body of tweet. #ASJA2012<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just learned: don't put @ first. Start with a . (dot) to expand the tweet.  #asja2012<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sree #sreetips: The future of journalism is digitized and specialized. Disagree. It's the present, not the future. #ASJA2012<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sree prediction: Soon hashtags will appear on book &amp; mag  covers: Your ability to talk about him behind his back to his face. #ASJA2012<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sree: Technology is really easy. (Please say it again. and again. and again) @ASJA2012<|endoftext|>
