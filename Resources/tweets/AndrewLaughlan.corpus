<|startoftext|>Jorginho is so close to a second yellow, take him off before he‚Äôs sent off.   #CHESEV<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@c_j_mcburney My initial thought was: is it possible to play the algorithm so that loads of edifying content is pushed your way? Can we use the rabbit holes they lead us to for good?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those 3 assists Willian bagged against Fulham are soon becoming a distant memory...   Now imagine signing him on a 3 year deal...  #LIVARS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The referees aren‚Äôt to be blamed, they‚Äôre simply enforcing the rules.  Issue lies with the FA. Surely they will see sense and change the rule?  #TOTNEW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet the 3 goals come from academy  players...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3-0 down last season meant the game was over. 3-0 this season, I‚Äôm a little more optimistic with Werner, Havertz etc on the pitch.  #WBACHE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This aged well...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man Utd winning after the final whistle (surprise), with a Bruno #Fernandes penalty (not a surprise).   #BRIMUN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(assumed XI, 4-2-3-1)                       Mendy   James     Silva      Zouma    Chilwell                 #Rice      Kovacic     Zyiech      Havertz        Pulisic                       Werner  Serious competition for places.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If we sign Rice, it would mean that our strongest XI would be made up of 7 new signings.   I personally can‚Äôt see how that gels together this season, next season however could be incredibly exciting. Immense potential.  #Rice #Chelsea<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Game on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is nothing short of a brilliant idea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@c_j_mcburney @jakeheasman A very confused 1st half for him, but definitely grew into the 2nd half. Had flashes of what he‚Äôs capable of, deserved an assit towards the end.   If it wasn‚Äôt for the lack of true wingers in the squad, I‚Äôd say a loan to the Bundesliga would benefit all involved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chilwell assist in the last 15 mins, exactly what I was hoping for.   #CHEBAR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DISCLAIMER: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs going right to the very top‚Äù üëë<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It may be against Barnsley, and that is a completely fair comment - but a  Kai Havertz hatrick speaks volumes about his potential.  #CHEBAR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope Chelsea manage the game well enough that it allows Chilwell to come on for a composed debut, rather than a tense last 15 mins of defending.  #CHEBAR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You‚Äôd have thought this would be the perfect game for a fully fit Loftus-cheek to find some form...   Strange omission unless he‚Äôs off on loan.   #CHEBAR<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@c_j_mcburney Our small groups started last week and have been such an encouragement so far - will be praying for yours!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What was His reason? Could it be in fact, that we are made equal, but different. In a way that only 2 genders (Male and Female) could express and complement each other? 4/4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If your answer is that God created us Male and Female, therefore there can only be 2 genders; we must pursue WHY God made us Male and Female (only 2 genders). 3/4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Male and Female are the same and equal, why not a third gender or forth? If they‚Äôre the same, and there is no difference thus blurring the lines, why not a third equal and same gender? 2/4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If God made us Male and Female, yet you believe Male and Female are equal and the same (rather than equal yet different), then why are there only 2 genders? 1/4<|endoftext|>
