<|startoftext|>@psj211 I never been there but am sure it is different here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliAlAhmed_en @rcallimachi In Iraq and Iraqi Kurdistan is too hard to find a local journalist who don’t work for a party, person or a family. People like #HushamAlHashimi are very unique here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t know why I don’t trust numbers which end with 5 and zero.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>False news<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FlorianNeuhof And We fixers also in danger all the time because since after 2003 who ever work with foreigners is wanted by some radical groups.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FlorianNeuhof It seems very easy in Baghdad to hire some people and assassinate people, Foriegn journalists always look for real stories and political issues that’s why it is dangerous for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the CCTV you can see #HushamAlHashimi sons right after he was assassinated, They also killed the dream of his sons.  https://t.co/1HkvmhvXYs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HaiderAlAbadi هاي كلها بسببك انت هم مشترك كنت رئيس وزراء العراق لاربع سنين ماسيطرت عن الميليشيات و دوختنا بكلمة "البعض" و اخير شي تصرح تكول بس ٨ نساء استشهدوا بالموصل بس صور جثث شهداء الموصل اللي بموبايلي ب ايام التحرير اكثر من شعرات راسك.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is the Iraqi government brave enough to honestly and truly say who assassinated #Husham_Alhashimi? This is the best exam for @MAKadhimi to announce the melitia or persons who killed Hashimi.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the reasons I never liked to work in #Baghdad is too easy to get killed. My dear journalist friends please be careful in your movements in the city of #Baghdad especially if you cover things related to #Iran backed militias.  #HushamAlHashimi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IraqiPMO @MAKadhimi اتذكرت المالكي لمن ب ٢٠١٤ كال خلال ٢٤ ساعة نستعيد السيطره عن الموصل<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EllieMSennett @AJStream Citizens or the once whom their houses destroyed now they don’t care about the arches or history of the city they just want to rebuild their houses and go back instead of being displaced<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EllieMSennett @AJStream Mosul before ISIS was very unsafe and isis was there already and it was unsafe and forgotten from the government. For the destruction isis was the cause of what happened to the city<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EllieMSennett @AJStream Iraq is one of the richest countries in the world had a lot of money so the government is the main responsible for the lack of rebuilding,  This is so hard to answer here but even God cannot stop corruption in Iraq.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel heartbroken when i see houses like this in Mosul is destroyed and nobody can replace it, because all the marbles gone and the stonemasons were Christians and they are not living in mosul.  #mosul #iraq #everydaymiddleeast #isis #war #peace #marbles #stone #window  https://t.co/sHIXOpLBYn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EllieMSennett @AJStream Hi Ellie, nice to meet you here,  I can express three reasons here why there is NO recovery not slow, first of all is Iraq depends only on Oil for its economy, second bad management, third is racism or sectarianism.<|endoftext|>
