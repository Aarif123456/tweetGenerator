<|startoftext|>7. The piece outlines four ingredients necessary to make US foreign policy work for the next generations of Americans. As we write: ‚ÄúSmart policymaking must not just address the problems over the horizon, but also serve the people there too.‚Äù<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>6. Gen Z brings a unique outlook to foreign policy ‚Äì informed by our rich diversity, digital nativity, 21st-century upbringing, global connectedness, and skepticism of key tenets of US policy. With the stakes so high‚Äîespecially for us‚Äîwe deserve our fair say at this moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5. At risk is a worrying misalignment between America‚Äôs decision-makers and America‚Äôs youth, who will one day take the country‚Äôs helm and have starkly different views on critical foreign policy issues than today‚Äôs leaders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4. Gen Z will bear the brunt of this policy fallout, but its perspective is largely absent from today‚Äôs policy debate. Foreign policy remains a field driven by older elites. Gen Z‚Äôs growing electoral gravity (now 1 in 10 US voters) has not translated into policy influence.  https://t.co/GnklyIBzgZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3. These challenges aren‚Äôt going away anytime soon, and it is Gen Z that will face the second- and third-order consequences of today‚Äôs policies for decades to come.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Preaching ‚Äì rather than listening ‚Äì to these Americans breeds bad policymaking abroad and more toxic politics at home. For whom is U.S. foreign policy supposed to work, if not for everyday Americans? (5/7)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sure, foreign policy doesn‚Äôt dominate kitchen-table conversations as much as other critical issues (rightfully and understandably so). But that doesn‚Äôt mean most Americans don‚Äôt have views, or that those views should not be accounted for. (4/7)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We all expect our national politics and policies to reflect the concerns, aspirations, and interests of our citizens. But for decades, in the realm of foreign policy Washington has been especially paternalistic in assuming that only it knows best. (3/7)<|endoftext|>
