<|startoftext|>A trump pardon of Julian Assange and Edward Snowden seems likely. Given they’ll agree to hosting their own channel on TNN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump News Network is coming. Be ready for it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@econoar Nor should they give it up. They should just innovate how it’s done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@econoar I wish we could change this narrative.   BTC doesn’t have to be money. It will succeed as a store of value used to evade fiat inflation.  ETH is just a programmable global trustless excel sheet to manage ownership of assets.   Governments will never give up control of MoE money<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ManuelPolavieja Bitcoin is a store of value to hedge against fiat inflation. Ethereum is a trustless excel sheet to build out layers of complex transactions (not just financial)   They are completely different things. Wake up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ManuelPolavieja It would no longer be a trustless settlement layer... this argument is nonsensical<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheKennyHoffman @StieglitzThe @thehill I’m not arguing against paying off student loans for under privileged people. I’m just arguing the current game plan will hurt these people much more than it aims to help them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheKennyHoffman @StieglitzThe @thehill “Free” always comes with a cost.   You can choose to be blind to that cost or you can acknowledge that fact and align a political idea as big as paying off student loans accordingly,  to mitigate or even avoid hurting the same people you claim you are trying to help<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheKennyHoffman @StieglitzThe @thehill The job of the federal govt is not to be your parent. That’s your parents job<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheKennyHoffman @StieglitzThe @thehill Life is just a reflection of your past decisions. If people continue to make poor decisions suffering mounts.   IMO the job of a federal govt is to lay a viable path for a person so they can have the option of choosing to make a better decision<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheKennyHoffman @StieglitzThe @thehill To conclude that the only viable options are the poor suffering or not suffering is also a fallacy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheKennyHoffman @StieglitzThe @thehill I’d argue that you’re arguing shallow points which won’t change anything  To change a country of 300+ million people you have to lay the foundation for proper incentives, under the assumption that every single individual is acting in their own interest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheKennyHoffman @StieglitzThe @thehill I spent more time in a church by the time I was 10 than you have in your whole life.   We are too far apart to agree on anything if you’re making these silly statements comparing debt collectors to god, as tho you have this child like understanding of a man in the sky<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Melt_Dem Crypto currency is just a horrible word.   I wouldn’t even call BTC a crypto currency. I’d just say it arguably has crypto currency-esque features.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheKennyHoffman @StieglitzThe @thehill It’s like it’s this cancerous western flavor of Eastern religion manifested by cancel culture.   It’s the Yin without the Yang.   It’s the sacrifice without the suffering.   The absence of one completely erases the impact of the other<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheKennyHoffman @StieglitzThe @thehill My point is penalizing hard workers who paid off their debt, while rewarding those who have not paid, creates a disastrous incentive mechanism.    All love and no suffering is simply not how the world works, and it’s everything that’s wrong with our generation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheKennyHoffman @StieglitzThe @thehill I’m literally the person that has paid 1 year of a student loan and would be the “victim” of my own policy and am lost on your point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheKennyHoffman @StieglitzThe @thehill You sound like one of those participation trophy people..  I’d encourage you to reflect on reality instead of love and flower children.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheKennyHoffman @StieglitzThe @thehill The lender would always have a record of the money paid off on the loan. And if they’re 1 year out of college and haven’t paid a dime, let them suffer for 5-10 years so they can reflect on their past decision to take out un manageable debt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheKennyHoffman @StieglitzThe @thehill Use your brain a little harder and re read what I said<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VladZamfir @MarmaMusic I’ve had libra explained to me as the first attempt at a new digital token to represent a basket of global currencies.

<|startoftext|>The current plan to cancel student debt is just game theoretically broken.   Incentivizing poor financial habits will only further break the system.

<|startoftext|>@lightcoin @nomojo321 @TrustlessState @robustus @RaoulGMI Just read about Flare. XRP ledger is basically the same thing as ethereum now and flare is just the EVM on XRP ledger. Interesting<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lightcoin @nomojo321 @TrustlessState @robustus @RaoulGMI Sounds like it will turn into a race for users and developers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lightcoin @nomojo321 @TrustlessState @robustus @RaoulGMI And on top of it all their business model is less than ideal. They are generating a total of like $150 bucks a day from actual users. All funding for the platform comes from selling the token that nobody uses<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lightcoin @nomojo321 @TrustlessState @robustus @RaoulGMI It simply makes no sense. They’re trying to innovate something that has already been innovated.

<|startoftext|>@lightcoin @nomojo321 @TrustlessState @robustus @RaoulGMI Why would I ever use XRP to send money globally anywhere when I can send any amount of money pegged to any currency via an infrastructure protocol that utilizes stable coins and other synthetic assets?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lightcoin @nomojo321 @TrustlessState @robustus @RaoulGMI XRP the token has no inherent value. Ripple labs claims XRP is a product used to replace the SWIFT payment system but stablecoins already do this without a silly token<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@madave_lui @Odds75 @shaileshinpune @HesterPeirce @Ripple I’m at a loss as to how sending money globally and exchanging any currency pair anywhere instantly isn’t already solving the problem ripple has been talking about for years.   Not To mention is has billions in liquidity and tens of thousands of users and thousands of devs today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaileshinpune @madave_lui @Odds75 @HesterPeirce @Ripple They are as we speak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaileshinpune @Odds75 @madave_lui @HesterPeirce @Ripple This is where the yield farming craze came through. On DEX’es anyone in the world offers liquidity and farms the market maker fee. There is staggering amounts of liquidity in any pair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaileshinpune @Odds75 @madave_lui @HesterPeirce @Ripple Yes ample liquidity for all trading pairs on DEX’es and aggregators today. AML/KYC will be the responsibility of the on ramp (currently exchanges)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaileshinpune @Odds75 @madave_lui @HesterPeirce @Ripple No it’s all instant from your wallet. But completely traceable on ethereum for future parties to audit and implement kyc/aml as we enter that phase of maturity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaileshinpune @Odds75 @madave_lui @HesterPeirce @Ripple Uniswap. DEX’eds, and DEX aggregators. The first of which is currently bigger than Coinbase in volume<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Odds75 @madave_lui @HesterPeirce @Ripple No this is just plain false. It’s solved. I can do it right now. Billions of dollars today are being moved through stable coins. Anyone anywhere can buy a stablecoin today and take advantage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaileshinpune @Odds75 @madave_lui @HesterPeirce @Ripple Yeah see my previous posts. Stablecoins are usually issued by one entity and backed by physical assets in their custody. Then a digital token is created representing that asset on an infrastructure protocol, and voila, you’ve got fiat on the blockchain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@XRPZZA88 @Odds75 @shaileshinpune @madave_lui @HesterPeirce @Ripple They took a laid back approach to see how the environment would shape. Now that there’s clear understanding of the tech they are accommodating the winners of the space<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaileshinpune @Odds75 @madave_lui @HesterPeirce @Ripple There will likely be many flavors of euro or USD or GBP or AUD, etc. consumers will place their faith in their favorite bank to back the asset that they choose to digitize<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaileshinpune @Odds75 @madave_lui @HesterPeirce @Ripple Entities will mimic stable coins in all currencies which is currently happening. Issuers of stablecoins will be banks all across the globe acting as custodians for the backing of the digital currency they create to talk to the public infrastructure protocol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Odds75 @shaileshinpune @madave_lui @HesterPeirce @Ripple Private implementations are already being built to communicate with the public chain, coordinated by a company called consensys and a project called Quorom. JP Morgan and JPM coin are well underway in development<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Odds75 @shaileshinpune @madave_lui @HesterPeirce @Ripple US adoption of a framework for a trust less infrastructure protocol such as Ethereum allows them to build private implementations to talk to the public protocol and transact globally today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Odds75 @shaileshinpune @madave_lui @HesterPeirce @Ripple All it takes is a little bit of code and any US bank can issue their own stablecoin backed by fiat in their physical bank vaults. And it’s all already on an infrastructure protocol doing billions in volume with thousands of the best developers around the globe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Odds75 @shaileshinpune @madave_lui @HesterPeirce @Ripple XRP has no volume. If you have stats on development and daily users I’d like to see them. Tether is one of many stablecoins. They are the initial implementations of central bank digital currencies. JP Morgan’s will be out early 2021 and will essentially be the same thing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaileshinpune @madave_lui @Odds75 @HesterPeirce @Ripple Uniswap is currently the largest DEX and does more volume than Coinbase. It has liquidity pools to convert any asset into anything you would like all from your browser wallet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaileshinpune @madave_lui @Odds75 @HesterPeirce @Ripple And tether alone moves billions of dollars currently<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaileshinpune @madave_lui @Odds75 @HesterPeirce @Ripple Stablecoins are the first implementation.   They are digital representations of fiat currency operating on top of infrastructure protocols (Ethereum being the current leader) all I need is an ETH wallet and I can send GUSD, USDC, tether, dai, iEUR, iXAU, etc anywhere instantly<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Odds75 @madave_lui @abamieda9 @fredostat @HesterPeirce @Ripple I could send you usd anywhere in the world right now in 14 seconds? Why would Worry about using XRP?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Odds75 @madave_lui @abamieda9 @fredostat @HesterPeirce @Ripple It’s already being done. On public decentralized protocols transacting billions globally today. Ripple serves no purpose. It wasn’t a scam they just got beat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Odds75 @madave_lui @abamieda9 @fredostat @HesterPeirce @Ripple They just have to be a custodian of these assets within an already established blockchain infrastructure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Odds75 @madave_lui @abamieda9 @fredostat @HesterPeirce @Ripple Synthetix and stablecoins<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@madave_lui @abamieda9 @fredostat @Odds75 @HesterPeirce @Ripple All moneygram has to do is pivot as a custodian of stable coins and voila. They are what ripple wants to be in 10 years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madave_lui @abamieda9 @fredostat @Odds75 @HesterPeirce @Ripple They aren’t using xrp. They’re studying them and copying them because they have every reason to study blockchains<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fredostat @madave_lui @abamieda9 @Odds75 @HesterPeirce @Ripple Point is it’s obviously not ripple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fredostat @madave_lui @abamieda9 @Odds75 @HesterPeirce @Ripple That’s irrelevant to the argument cuz you ripple folk just attack other implementations as your argument for XRP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madave_lui @abamieda9 @fredostat @Odds75 @HesterPeirce @Ripple IMO it’s where the leading argument is. Show me real statistics on adoption on ripple. I’ve never met a single user or developer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madave_lui @abamieda9 @fredostat @Odds75 @HesterPeirce @Ripple I see central bank digital dollars moving globally on the biggest public infrastructure protocol out there. No need to add a strange middle man into the equation<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Steven_McKie It incentives poor spending habits and hard workers from paying off debt. The lesson learned is to not pay debt b/c someone will bail them out... Many people are all for paying off student debt including me, but with the powers of MMT come great responsibility.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steven_McKie Is it wrong to ask for a better plan which is more game theoretically sound?   Respect the haters for calling out a bad initial plan. Let politicians rework it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CL207 As much as I disagree with this logic, it’s completely brilliant to play off of<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nick_Prince12 @RayDalio @Dr_Mario_MD Yeah could be years that it works. Until that one day that it just doesn’t lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@josephdviviano @RayDalio @Dr_Mario_MD It’ll give things like Monero and other privacy coins room to shine. We’ve yet to see any evidence the US govt will ban BTC. They sell it, and let their biggest banks and investors buy it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nntaleb IMO they should only pay you if you’ve paid off your student loan, via a tax refund upon proof of student loan payments meeting or exceeding the proposed amount<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nick_Prince12 @RayDalio @Dr_Mario_MD That’s a pretty wild thought.   Couldn’t rule it out much much longer term.   But I think we’re now entering an MMT era which throws fiat being backed by anything out of the water. They’re going to attempt to control fiat through printing, taxation and 100% transparency<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nick_Prince12 @RayDalio @Dr_Mario_MD The US realizes it’s a digital asset SoV to hedge fiat inflation. It will never rival fiat currency for its intended purpose as a nations states MoE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@100mHODL @RayDalio @Dr_Mario_MD Preach this. Few understand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@josephdviviano @RayDalio @Dr_Mario_MD Money tracing is inevitable and is coming with CBDC’s. Let’s just embrace it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bitcoin. Is. Not. Money.   It’s a store of value for cash rich, yield hungry investors that evades fiat inflation.   That’s all it will ever be, and all it needs to be, to succeed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RayDalio @Dr_Mario_MD It’s. Not. A. Currency.   It’s a store of value for cash rich, yield hungry investors and an inflation hedge against fiat   That’s all it needs to be and all it ever will be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dbongino Actually there is. The money fairy is the Fed. Welcome to MMT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abv_Avg_Joe @Steven_McKie I wish they’d stop appealing to emotion and offer a plan with a better incentive mechanism.   why not offer a $10k tax credit applicable on proof of payment of any paid student loan   Then it’d incentivize you to work to get the tax credit and not punish hard workers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steven_McKie @Abv_Avg_Joe Federal loans, undergrad programs only.   Really disincentivizes conservative spenders and hard working individuals.. two previously admirable traits<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mjnoir1 @Andrey_VSaraiva @SenWarren We do. And the side affects will be much more detrimental under MMT.   For MMT to succeed it will demand extreme responsibility with its powers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Prepare for completely misleading headlines stating that cancelling the student debt is the greatest idea ever and anyone against it is racist towards young people.   Nevermind the insane logic behind the current proposal, and the catastrophic incentives it creates to be lazy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mjnoir1 @Andrey_VSaraiva @SenWarren It’s crazy to settle into this logic. Continuously rewarding those who are lazier than their peers will game theoretically lead a nation towards destruction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood Will check them out. It’s a favorable time for marijuana stocks and id imagine President Kamala will only make it more favorable to make up for all the brothas and sistas she locked up for it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood You ever dabble in the wacky tobacky?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC Something so complex shouldn’t be boiled down to “good” or “bad”. It’s utterly irresponsible for you to make such a basic statement without explaining what student loan forgiveness looks like<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood Disclaimer: I don’t actually hold any BTC. Too many other fun assets to play with<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood It’s a crazy fun rabbit hole for nerds like you and I<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood If you’re chasing yield buy ETH and stake it. Buy UNI and provide it, buy NXM and hedge it, buy YFI and farm it. Real estate is fine, just check out this once in a generational opportunity if you’ve got extra funds laying around<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood It’s the first fungible inflation-less asset ever created, and will outperform real estate by orders of magnitude as its magical powers of storing generational wealth are uncovered by the global population.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood I’m lost... why would this point mean Bitcoin is a bad investment? Unless you were assuming people buy Bitcoin to replace fiat currency?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood The same way you can trade a house or an equity or a commodity for fiat yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood Right it’s an asset. Similar to a house, or an equity or a commodity. But with its own unique value function<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood Yeah because fiat currency will always be the dominant MoE in nation states. They’re not competitors, only the dumb people inside crypto will tell you that.   Digital coins is a misleading label for these things. They’re not coins. Nor are they money as we perceive it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood  https://t.co/xuT6HBSLR6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood Bitcoin is not money. It’s the first perfectly engineered store of value. And that is wicked powerful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood Maybe it stems from a belief that all these things are coins and coins rival fiat. That’s not true. Fiat is king of money and will continue to act as the primary MoE (medium of exchange) within a nation state<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood That’s a false statement derived from an incorrect train of thought<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood Nexus Mutual (NXM) as tokenized insurance mutual ownership    https://t.co/XOlOfBwo4S (YFI) as yield eating robots  Uniswap (UNI) as DEX liquidity   Ethereum (ETH) as a bond for a decentralized web3 infrastructure   Bitcoin (BTC) as digital gold and SoV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood Real estate relative to fiat is good. Bitcoin as digital gold is great. Ethereum as digital bonds is life changing. Any tokenized assets that are web3 infrastructure related are life changing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood Key takeaway = Buy Bitcoin lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood The guidelines behind this are a joke. It directly incentives the lazy for being lazy and punishes those who work. It’s a game theoretic disaster<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@econoar The NFT market has yet to truly take off.   Largely in part to being denominated in ETH.   Which happens to do money better than money does money.  But is still not money<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AdamSinger Lol. My opinion is without suffering you can’t feel joy. Yin and the yang kind of thing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hudsonjameson Could you record this? I won’t be able to watch live but would absolutely watch after<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wrap it all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The media controls what we talk about and presents a “right” way to talk about that subject. Any other angle is deemed as blasphemy... One political party currently has complete control over this.. any idea which one it is?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hasufl @CedricMakes @_aristarchus_ Makes sense. Would be curious to see how this shifts as barriers to entry of leading privacy coins are removed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CedricMakes @hasufl @_aristarchus_ Any idea why they’re taking BTC when it’s so much more transparent relative to privacy coins?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lawlruschang It’s deeper than that. It’s spread into the literal definition of words, and its massaged into the fabric of our society<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lawlruschang I see why each party voted each way and respect each party. Let’s just all wake up to  the fact that our narrative is controlled<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lawlruschang I’m left leaning. I just want people to wake up to how much their life’s are controlled by manipulated narratives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lawlruschang Lol this is nothing about me. I’m just stating that this has been construed as a race war to win an election<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lawlruschang That’s not what this is about.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BanklessHQ @StakeETH @MaraSchmiedt Bah Dah Bah Bah Bah.. I’m lovin it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steven_McKie This is good advice for both parties<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lawlruschang The left specifically chose to rally support by creating a race issue. This was incredibly dangerous but they got what they wanted.. my only hope is that they can properly unwind what they have done over the next 4 years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lawlruschang I am white and grew up poor and grew up with a rural public education. There are plenty of whites in the same situation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lawlruschang If you are poor you are not black. If you had less opportunity to proper education you are not black.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will the gated institutional narrative ever allow us to believe that we do not have a racism problem, and that is it in fact a class + educational opportunity problem?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The lack of tolerance for alternative perspectives and constant strawmanning of opposing political parties is everything that is wrong with our democracy today.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Steven_McKie I don’t want to stand by trumps rhetoric, he just happens to be the face of it, but a lot of people will do anything to upset the gated institutional narrative controlling our government/media.

<|startoftext|>@TrustlessState @nic__carter Have you tried the whoop strap?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steven_McKie I fail to see any game theoretical explanation to explain their primary motivation as protecting the interests of middle/lower class Americans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steven_McKie This is intriguing. As an outsider, who’s only been aware of the FBI + CIA’s power for a relatively short period of time, I fear their true interest lie in maintaining current power structures<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rogersutton Idk how much sense that makes but I’m skeptical that there would just be one govt currency like today. More like a Fed blessed framework/rate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rogersutton Makes me wonder what the “sovereign CBDC” will look like. Could it just be a defined peg to other global currencies? And not an actual digital currency? So the banks just follow the guidelines/laws set forth by the govt to properly define the value of each separate CBDC?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rogersutton Sounds like that’s definitely what’s likely to happen.. but I think it’s also important to acknowledge that these private chains are being developed on Quorom which is just a private implementation of Ethereum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rogersutton IMO stablecoins are future CBDC’s. Take GUSD and USDC for example, both issued by two future banks. Pretty soon every major US Bank will have its own stablecoins blessed by the govt and managed by each respective bank. JPMC coming 2021 built on quorum making it ethereum friendly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KoroushAK They’re currently known as stablecoins but will soon be known as CBDC’s which are here to stay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanSAdams @BanklessHQ Neither changes anything. All that matters is the perceived rate of projected inflation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@micahliked @RyanSAdams @BanklessHQ That’s silly.. All that matters is the perceived rate of projected inflation. Which changes from no party<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zacky_p18 @TheEconomist It’s less a way of saying free speech should be illegal and more synonymous with journalists current   fascination on fabricating a racial war through consistently misleading headlines. #SlipTheDISC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ainmanr @Toddricks3000 @TheEconomist Take out the red and blue teams and both Biden and trump are economically liberal relative to the recent past   Justifying narrow minded partisanship by the economist is the real ignorance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rsarrow @robustus Definitely. I think looking back were already in it. Stimulus checks, + FED money printing to buy bonds + stocks through blackrock sure smells MMT-ish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeFi_Dad A thorough explanation on why DeFi number doesn’t only go up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterSchiff Yield starved investors will be forced in DeFi + BTC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheEconomist Political bias of any kind, from any major media outlet should be criminal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rsarrow @robustus As a never MMT’er, I’m warming up to the arguments of how long they can successfully enact MMT.   By utilizing CBDC’s potential for greater monetary control they would be able to control fiat inflows/outflows 1000x better than through current system thus curbing inflation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robustus Sounds pretty accurate.   I’d add Gov adopts blockchain to properly enact MMT by giving banks power to distribute their own stablecoins akaCBDC’s.   Yield starved funds + institutions increasingly allocate to BTC/defi   Inflation explodes  BTC blamed   World ends<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BanklessHQ MMT is bi partisan (the printers won’t stop)   Outcomes ranked from best to worst (financially)  1. Trump clean sweep 2. Biden clean sweep 3. Trump wins contested election  4. Biden wins contested election   Biden=higher taxes and delayed stimulus Trump=immediate stimulus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrustlessState Short/medium term could be horrible for bags with a Biden win due to delayed stimulus + capital flight from cashing out due to increased probability of drastically higher taxes in 2021<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Attacking BTC with the straw man argument that it must replace fiat is silly. It’s a SoV hedge against fiat inflation and that’s all it needs to be.  CBDC’s are well beyond a rough draft and known as stablecoins. All govt has to do is bless them  @KeithMcCullough @DiMartinoBooth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrismartenson This seems more correlated to rural vs cities. Having lived in both it’s just different. Most people live in small towns with nothing to do but gossip and everyone knows everyone.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CedricMakes Always appreciate your perspective Cedric<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CedricMakes I’m skeptical on reorg attack. If miners reorg attack Ethereum it’ll severely impact long term profitability and price appreciation in ETH which inadvertently kills their business.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CedricMakes *market makers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CedricMakes Do you believe traditional market markets will be able to adapt and implement a more traditional approach on DEX’s? I’m a big believer that DEX’s are 100x more efficient than CEX’s and can operate at drastically cheaper rates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CedricMakes IMO the breakthrough in DeFi currently stems from the decentralization of market makers.. this unleashed a revolutionary new way of doing things and LP’s will continue to be farmed until they are hyper efficient. But I don’t necessarily see the money leaving DeFi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog Well put joe. Difficult for Trump to refute that one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChihChengLiang Solid like coal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BatmanDeFi @g3nology @NexusMutual @iearnfinance The price is not like other coins. It’s purely a function of its bonding curve.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@halfinney22 @sassal0x @iearnfinance In 1 hour and 20 mins it can technically be deployed at any time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Few Understand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cryptoseed2 @DeFiGod1 @TheCryptoDog NXM's price is based off a bonding curve with two crucial components. MCR and MRC%. do a couple calculations and youll be blown away. Rewards are orders of magnitude greater than potential risk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QWQiao Banks need to loosen lending standards before we see any type of inflation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CedricMakes Pass through securities, or hybrid utility/equity tokens are a bigger breakthrough than the ICO. It’s going to be fun watching them mature<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jdorman81 @FelixOHartmann @cyounessi1 What we are beginning to see really is fascinating<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jdorman81 @FelixOHartmann @cyounessi1 Would you consider nexus mutual (NXM) a pass through? It provides equity in the form of governance rights to tokens holders and utility through collection of smart contract insurance premiums from staking confidence in any given smart contract.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@knightman_ba @CedricMakes I agree with knightman. Current governance tokens in DeFi will mature into “hybrid-pass thru” digital assets. The best example ive seen so far is @NexusMutual<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MapleLeafCap Is there a website or any explanation as to how WNXM is pegged to NXM? Does 1NXM back each WNXM?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stackinnumeris @TheCryptoLark @zackvoell To the end user does it really matter?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarpeNoctom does this provide any particular bullish or bearish insight, in your opinion?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1stCRYPTOKING @antiprosynth @RyanWatkins_ @pierre_rochard ETH is not money. It’s more like a hybrid bond/commodity. Just because it has money properties and can do money better than fiat can do money in its infancy, does not make it money. It’s scope is soooo much bigger than to be a money<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanSAdams It’s inevitable<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Great podcast with Charlie Noyes. Just wanted to mention, when you say you mean “ETH is money” because it acts as a store of value asset, I agree completely. There should just be a better word for this than “money”! @RyanSAdams @BanklessHQ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bst_wood @mcmo35 @LjWatson21 your a VC. Have you guys ventured into any crypto currencies, crypto assets, decentralized platforms, DeFi protocols/tokens or companies supporting a decentralized financial infrastructure of any kind?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood @mcmo35 I’ll fight it to the grave that my investments in certain protocols or decentralized tokens have sound hypothesis underneath them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood @mcmo35 An investment is anything someone puts money into supported by a rational investment thesis with the expectations of an ROI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood @mcmo35 I’d define a gamble as ignorant spending by any individual expecting an ROI on the money they spent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood @mcmo35 For example, BTC and ETH are not undergoing a pump and dump. It’s a series of continuous garter hype cycles as liquidity accumulated in each respective protocol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood @mcmo35 Pumps and dumps literally happen in every market. Just look at HTZ the day they declared bk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood @mcmo35 Pump and dumps are not an issue in tokens with real world use cases, sound game theory and actual functioning dApps or platforms<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood @mcmo35 Pumps and dumps only became notorious in crypto due to the revolutionary new ability to capture billions in value in 10 lines of code and a Reddit presence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood @mcmo35 Pump and dumps happen in every market. Doing what I described above mitigates risk of falling victim to a pump and dump dramatically<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood @mcmo35 Dollar cost averaging into reputable projects with real world use cases, sound game theory and actual functioning dApps or platforms is the only way to go.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AdamSinger Did you learn to always stoop towards personal attacks during what should be an opportunity for growth when discussing opposing viewpoints?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamSinger Trumps a terrible person sure, but he’s the first person to chink the armor of a severely flawed political system. A Biden victory only retards the growth of the Democratic Party even more. Another trump victory shakes the system, and reforms the Democratic Party<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamSinger I consider myself center or center left, but the Democratic Party has insulted its supporters intelligence one to many times for me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamSinger What’s our other option? A corpse?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood DeFi tokens, decentralized stores of value, and decentralized trustless computing platforms provide investment opportunities of a lifetime<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IMO_Sha_J @JamesTodaroMD I do want to trust my govt on making decisions like this since I’m no doctor. That’s why I hope it’s not political, cuz it’d ruin the last ounce of trust I have in govts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PinataDrunk @JamesTodaroMD If it is, political manipulation of the truth should be criminal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesTodaroMD I’m genuinely confused by this whole controversy. Is it purely political or do we have legitimate reasons to be concerned with hydroxychloroquine use?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood It takes up to 14 weeks to determine official cause of death for the death cert. local and regional health depts release a cause of death sooner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood @MorgenRochard What time do you normally stream<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood @MorgenRochard Lol you called it an investment so my work here is done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood @MorgenRochard The home is sold and the remaining balance of the mortgage is paid off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood @MorgenRochard Interest on mortgages could be viewed as premium, taxes/HOA dues/HOI/PMI can be viewed as carry costs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood @MorgenRochard To sum it up I view a house as an investment because it’s a scarce non fungible asset with its own market upon which valuation is controlled via supply and demand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood @MorgenRochard Homes are scarce unique assets within an incredibly functional market. So long as the market retains a healthy level of supply/demand a home can be defined as an investment vehicle of its respective market<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood @MorgenRochard A mortgage to the borrower isn’t an investment as it’s a liability, but that liability to the borrower is still an asset to the lienholder since someone bought that loan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood @MorgenRochard Anecdotally I can’t think of a single home that hasn’t increased in value in the past 50 years. If someone bought a home in cash anytime in the past it is worth more today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood @MorgenRochard Bonds are investment vehicles same as homes. Homes arguably have more attractive properties as an investment vehicle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood @MorgenRochard Sounds more like an investment than a negative yielding bond<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood @MorgenRochard The super wealthy treat homes as investments<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood @MorgenRochard It’s a hard asset that has traditionally increased in value so id call it an investment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MorgenRochard That’s too broad. If I buy a washing machine cheap on Craigslist, and flip it on FB marketplace that is an investment. And someone who bought a home 30 years ago made the best investment of their life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just imagine a world where the wealthy are legally obligated to buy negative yielding assets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The rush to hard assets is real. The FED absolutely will meet/exceed its inflation targets and the bond market is broken. Rates will continue to 0 or lower and politicians will present radical new MMT flavored solutions to the income inequality problem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Dollar milkshake theory is dead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VladZamfir ETH is the bastard child of a bond and a commodity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood 😂 it is if you’re a bank. The fed will just bail you out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood A little birdy told me being responsible with money nowadays involves taking out a $100k loan and shoving on #BTC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood Agreed. Unfortunately the era of rewarding fiscal conservatism is dead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood After coronavirus emergency stimulus it will be either infrastructure stimulus with trump, green stimulus with Biden or creative genius stimulus with Yeezus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bst_wood MMT is here to stay<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sassal0x I think we are only realizing market cap is a poor metric when gauging validity of the fat protocol thesis...The Ethereum network derives its value as an unprecedented decentralized settlement layer. ETH valuation still needs to correlate with on chain value to maintain security<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The quality of the projects coming out of DeFi right now cannot be ignored.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sassal0x While deFi tokens don’t directly correlate to ETH value, it still seems that there will be a lagging correlation as Ethereum market cap is directly related to the security of the network on which these defi tokens exist.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GenReportPod @HoweGeneration I’d have to write a novel. But as a late 20 something I can sense the unrest, we can all see the lack of presidential leadership and the political mess, and we can see the unprecedented actions in the economy.

<|startoftext|>@GenReportPod @HoweGeneration Regenecy starts with the shift towards socialism (under the guise of MMT) and a younger leader taking charge.. which is bubbling up but probably doesn’t spill over until peak civil unrest which is quickly approaching<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GenReportPod @HoweGeneration Eh I disagree. All we did in ‘08 was reinflate the bubble to bring us where we are today. There is no new leader that has unified the younger generation, there’s max distrust in govt + a wider wealth gap. IMO peak crisis period is starting<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RyanSAdams Great podcast to really narrow down where I disagree with the “ETH is money” argument... if you ask anyone on the streets, “what’s an example of money?”, they will say USD. Which is not a SoV it’s solely a MoE. And ETH is not meant to be an MoE #notmoney<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NicTrades Yes buttt they desperately need warm weather to kill the virus.

<|startoftext|>@NicTrades Ah so if I’m reading your tweet correctly you’re saying there will basically be a double whammy of inflationary pressure both from supply shock + printing money?   The FED is begging for inflation right now with so many deflationary pressures on USD so I expect it to even out.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@QArtho @gordonkeith The official #COVID19 death toll is nowhere near accurate. Same with the total infection rate. 10% of the global population is under quarantine, likely well over 1 million infected and a death toll likely 10-15x the Chinese narrative<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It’s mind boggling how the US media fails to acknowledge the risk #coronavirus becomes a global pandemic. We all know China is lying about total cases. Listen to the experts and they tell you there’s possibly 300k actual cases and doubling every 5 days. @EricRWeinstein<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@max_bronstein agreed. But ETH doesnt become money if DAI becomes money correct? I believe its very important to differentiate between assets that sit atop Ethereum (the infrastructure protocol) with its incentive (ETH), and money protocols such as DAI or wBTC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@econoar sure this fits a loosely held definition of money. BUT its just weird to the end consumer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@econoar now imagine this bond appreciates through until maturity and it is residing on a blockchain. Given there is a place or mechanism to facilitate exchanges of these bonds for other assets the blockchain allows you to trade it instantly for an agreed upon price<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@econoar IMO Ether aspires to be the incentive to power Ethereum (the infrastructure) Similar to how interest earned on a corporate bond incentivizes investors to provide growth opportunities(via investment) to a corporation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@econoar Ether aspires to become money? Or Ether aspires to act as an infrastructure protocol for decentralized trust, upon which an interconnected web of monies can reside?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lawlruschang @econoar the fact that its possible to use ETH as a MoE and the fact that it is 100x stronger in this domain than current money doesnt necessarily mean ETH should be used as a money... Using ETH as a money and branding it to consumers as a money isnt in its best interests long term<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lawlruschang @econoar right but people wouldnt transact in some new instantly liquid bond or commodity in the real world if it was possible. They would use a common Medium of Exchange like the US dollar for example.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lawlruschang @econoar fair point as well. i just believe a space exists for crypto 'currencies' to live with MoE being the end goal of that particular project. And for a protocol like ETH to continue to develop, its in its best interest to not make decisions hindering Ethereums ultimate goal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>in a pure Proof of Stake (PoS) environment, which Ethereum will eventually adopt, it seems entirely too complicated and confusing to transact at the application layer with ETH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lawlruschang @econoar in a pure Proof of Stake (PoS) environment, which Ethereum will eventually adopt, it seems entirely too complicated and confusing to transact at the application layer with ETH... why not wrap some BTC, or use a stable coins to give consumers a means of transacting on the network?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lawlruschang @econoar it is programmable using smart contracts but it is also a programmable base protocol layer used to incentive a trustless global computer upon which true monies acting as Mediums of Exchanges (MoE's) can grow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lawlruschang @econoar But does it really make sense that ETH's final goal is to become a MoE? Sure it is a liquid asset that has an agreed upon value at any given moment but why does ETH have to compete against a stable coin or a true 'crypto currency' when it is so much more than that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@econoar @jemenger @scott_lew_is calling ETH a money just sounds demeaning towards ETH because It is so much more than that... It is the digital framework for a brand new global economy to talk shape. One upon which true monies like DAI or wBTC can take hold.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@econoar ETH is in no way a programmable money nor should it be...

<|startoftext|>@skyghi @KyleSamani yeah play to win could get dangerous, but would be sweet lol... if only there was a mechanism that rewarded a play to earn environment. so the money earned in game would have to come from the player extracting value in a way other than gambling on an outcome.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AdamLocklin @kwadrax @RyanSAdams i dont think it necessarily has to be on the ethereum main network, but they will have to talk to some infrastructure protocol for consensus.

<|startoftext|>@prestonjbyrne @nicksdjohnson @malloc8 yeah but if you have the same old Ethereum unable to make any changes in code for 10+ years like Bitcoin, then Ethereum would fail as a project....

<|startoftext|>@AnselLindner @BitcoinTina most decentralized applications sitting on top of infrastructure protocols wont be investable tokens. The sooner people realize this, the sooner the whole ecosystem advances.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnselLindner @BitcoinTina 99% of altcoins are shit... whats your point?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnselLindner @BitcoinTina your view of the global financial system is incredibly flat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TuurDemeester BTC's use case rests solely as a digital, decentralized store of value.. So in theory it could sit on top of an infrastructure protocol as a means of payment within this new economy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TuurDemeester you critique assumes ETH is a money and is comparable to BTC... Ethereum is a layer 1 infrastructure protocol for a new web3.0. This makes it more comparable to a hybrid bond/commodityish asset.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realLudvigArt @AnselLindner bitcoin will win as a digital store of value, im not arguing that in any way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realLudvigArt @AnselLindner you assume its bitcoin vs the world... thats silly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realLudvigArt @AnselLindner This does not apply to a fully decentralized stable coin.... check out DAI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BitcoinTina @AnselLindner I agree tokens are silly... But a decentralized  blockchain is nothing but a facilitator of trust.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@econoar @TuurDemeester I’ll check it out. Thanks Eric<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TuurDemeester @econoar And if that becomes the case won’t a large amount of it be used for its primary purpose of staking?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TuurDemeester @econoar Also want to throw in an idea... if stable coins continue to succeed, privacy coins progress, and bitcoin continues working on projects such as RSK, won’t a PoS ETH be seen less as a currency and more as a hybrid bond/commodity to secure a decentralized web3.0 infrastructure?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TuurDemeester @econoar The market should find a balance between market participation and yield... however ETH’s current specs do concern me slightly for PoS. IMHO in the beginning yield should be closer to 15-20%with up to &gt;20% participation, to properly reward such a high risk endeavor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnselLindner Check out all the developments of new stable coins pegged to the USD... ZERO volatility and ALL of the benefits of instant and cheap transfers of wealth globally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnselLindner You just need value in general... in a proof of stake network you can have a trustless protocol secured by a token that operates similar to a hybrid bond/commodity of sorts, then you can have true currencies transacted on top of this network.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnselLindner USD and all common currencies will soon be able to operate in the blockchain world<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KyleSamani metamask gets me the most excited about web3.0.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnselLindner money isnt the only asset to convey scarcity.. so why cant blockchain technology be implemented among a variety of digital assets?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kanyewest #YEonJRE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paralleldown What about thinking of ETH as a hybrid commodity/bond like asset?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@j3todaro ETH will then appear more like a hybrid commodity/bond like asset which is used as fuel to power this global supercomputer, while BTC is the main currency for users to transact in this new economy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@j3todaro I think we can separate “crypto currencies” and “infrastructure protocols”. We will see crypto currencies like BTC (most likely winner) operate on infrastructure protocols like ETH (most likely winner). Then we will see a new wave of dApps operating in this new ecosystem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tokenstate @econoar @coinbase yeah but we haven't seen real world adoption for anything besides BTC and ETH. With Coinbases agenda to list as many assets as possible, and with 99% of the industry swimming in speculation, its not surprising that the guys making the decisions are doing so in their favor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_CryptoChat_ @econoar @crocotrading @RyanSAdams so a validator receives incentives to validate in three ways. 1. Validator interest, 2. Staking fees, and 3. appreciation of the underlying asset.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@econoar @crocotrading i agree that 2.5% is too low for a validator interest %... however has there been discussion on the expected % return from gas fees to validators?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skyghi Theory follows price until price follows theory. Volatility is orders of magnitude higher when theory is following price.  https://t.co/y93tmgR3jt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>incentive to Validate a PoS chain = Validator interest % + gas fees + appreciation of the asset<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skyghi Yeah high risk means nothing about reward. and yes you cant assume impossibility from probability. You can only infer the likelihood.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skyghi high risk does not mean high reward. Both are separate calculations... Good investments are those with an optimal risk/reward ratio suitable for the investors portfolio.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skyghi The data also implies extremely high risk for limited upside relative to possible returns for each $1 invested... As an investor, its good practice to minimize this opportunity cost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skyghi the best conclusions are ones derived from as many data points as possible, yet are still fluid enough to change in an instant. Emotion in markets only decreases this fluidity.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@zhusu ripple labs is much more interesting than their first product (XRP)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zhusu needless to say i also do not believe any crypto asset will succeed in becoming a true currency,.. Bitcoin will win as a form of digital gold and internet protocols (ETH/EOS/etc) will act as fuel to power a more decentralized internet and allow for dApp ecosystems to grow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zhusu On top of that, within 2-5 years the edge they have on the tech side will be eradicated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zhusu i cant say i disagree with any of your points,,. but i think XRP critics strongest point revolves around the fact that they are aiming to compete with governments.  Their competitor completely controls both the market (the monetary system) and the customer base (their citizens).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zhusu i fail to understand why anyone would utilize a currency created by a corporation. Governments will just implement blockchain-esque solutions into their native fiat currencies, and presto. XRP will have no competitive edge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@twobitidiot is this due to the lack of reputable PoS assets in existence or doubt surrounding PoS as an underlying consensus mechanism?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DickeyNate @cburniske we can compare the daily gas spend against total transaction count to infer whether ETH is being used for its primary purpose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DickeyNate @cburniske However the metric of simply looking at the total number of transactions doesnt accurately reflect adoption. Since Ethereum is a platform thats main purpose is to execute complex blocks of code, and knowing that this purpose requires larger gas costs per transaction<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DickeyNate @cburniske Simple transactions from buying ETH brought relatively high tx volume to the overall transaction count. Since the buying mania has subsided there are currently less market participants resulting in less overall transactions.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cburniske Maybe, human languages are too narrow in scope to quantify and predict human behavior. Maybe if our scope is broadened to account for more abstract yet just as true laws, we can then begin to quantify human behavior.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattDavidKaye @cburniske but when you personally make decisions as to your behavior are you uncertain of the decision you will make? Is there a deep underlying set of incentives that move your behavior? Maybe we have observed human behavior through the wrong lens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cburniske humans are most certainly irrational. BUT predicting behavior based on a Psychological Incentive Hierarchy, tailored to unique groups of people, and then comparing this with competing economic ideals seems feasible.<|endoftext|>
