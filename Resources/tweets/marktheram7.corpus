<|startoftext|>@MuttonMolester Basically trolled for being slightly larger than the other three in the group. Anti-social media summed up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On to series 3 - and a little bit in love with 'Tokyo'  ♥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dcfc87 No-deal Brexit and No-deal Derby 😱<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RevRichardColes Both duck food Rev. Sorry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just caught up with #motd2 , and Alex Scott was intelligent, articulate, and knowledgeable.  The old moaners really need to move on from this issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyZeb Feel like the chap in the middle?😁  https://t.co/s2eJGranex<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mo Salah needs to stop throwing himself around. Taking away from the fact that he's an obviously excellent player.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcusWolthers 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Morning all. Have a good week.  https://t.co/dbPafqoKjW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@2016industrial Fantastic mate. Need more tv like it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The infectious enthusiasm of Bob Mortimer in Gone Fishing is a thing of absolute joy. Love him. #gonechristmasfishing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dcfc87 Yeah, blocked him ages ago ! 🚫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CampervanJohn Yeah, all very good players.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyalicebx It's mesmerising and disturbing at the same time !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyalicebx Ooh er....😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamHappyToast @RealBobMortimer 👏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmyGuardDT Absolutely glorious 🙌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dangerous180 Nice one. I've only seen the 3 from the late 70's early 80's !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ymick60 I would say it's unbelievable  - but with him......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More than 250 synagogues were destroyed during #Kristallnacht , and our shit of a PM decides to reference it here. Appalling 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dangerous180 Do you need to have watched the films?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wonder if Bogle and Lowe have any regrets? Some Derby fans wanted £20m for the pair. Think we got a good deal. (I'm sure one season of prem league wages will help 😏)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JakeBarker1212 That special crowd noise you get when a certain player starts off on a run. He would definitely feed off that imo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@breakingavnews @Gertlet Surprised he wasn't shot in Murica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanPemb84232474 One thing for certain - we get a penalty in yesterday's game!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have one question - is that baby buggy being towed behind a motorbike? 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you can't guess the punchline, you need help 😉  https://t.co/jhdQRbGfwj<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Enter Tom Ince.......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimmyDCFC Embarrassing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dcfc87 Definitely a VAR penalty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimmyDCFC I don't think even he knew tbh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did the Derby players have some very heavy mince pies at half time?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whittaker and Bird......not a single muscle between them 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Marshall is our most vocal keeper for a while I think. Helps defenders out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@topklobber I'm strangely confident Mick - I don't like it 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably tough on Fozzy, but good to see Buchanan back 👍<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cymru_79 Oh those eyes......"why you do this to me mummy?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stace_dcfc Absolutely, totally believable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stace_dcfc It's great to have him back in Liverpool, where his 'troubles' began. Ties the whole thing together nicely 👌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stace_dcfc Enjoy Stace. I wish I hadn't rushed through it so quickly now! The only issue with it, is that as usual the uk police are portrayed as either corrupt or incompetent! So much gunfire - so few police.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stainsey2020 @dcfc87 No call for spitting though Caroline, you'll get your refund eventually 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulMotto @topklobber Whoever was in charge of cinematography had a high old time. Some great shots of Liverpool and surrounding areas.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@topklobber Probably Scotland v England, Hampden Park mid 80's. The waves of hatred coming from the Scotland fans made it absolutely electric (and terrifying 😳)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This dude needs a career change like you @Gem_Szr 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gem_Szr @topklobber I nearly didn't drive up for the 2nd leg. Only because @alexstewardd persuaded me. Would have missed it otherwise!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Gem_Szr You've sent that 2 days running. You feeling ok 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TamworthRam @sjforsyth @DCRAM73 I remember Sam Rush bragging about the capture of Albentosa in a talk at Derby Uni. Using Mel's money for private planes etc....yeah, that went well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TamworthRam @sjforsyth @DCRAM73 Ah, yeah. The next Roy McFarland ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjforsyth @DCRAM73 Who?.......<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's fine having a 'controversial' opinion if you have the balls to put your name to it, but this is just a bit pathetic. (If it's a 12yr old girl, I apologise for the 'balls' comment, as she won't have any)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@slates71 Absolutely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cavendishram @TheCurtisDavies Very odd. Obviously we know he doesn't represent the future, but we need some wise heads in there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It doesn't affect me personally, but Derby need to start refunding their supporters.  Poor form on the pitch AND off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1st names on the team sheet for me tomorrow would be Davies and Shinnie.  You can have all the willing youngsters you want, but without leadership they will be left to run round in circles.  #dcfc  https://t.co/jfIMp9rGYH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cLawn92 Oh Chris, I didn't need to see a cartoon Sam Rush this morning 😕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dadeenho Well I've never heard anything 'inspirational' come out of Rooney's mouth, but we can only hope that the players will respond to him. Desperate times for us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WestSussexRam I don't want either as manager Phil, but this doesn't sit right with me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dadeenho No they're not. We need an experienced manager. But in the meantime, what has Rooney done to be elevated above Rosenior?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Cavendishram It leaves an unpleasant taste.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Liam Rosenior has to be pissed off today. He might put a brave face on it, but elevating Rooney above the man who has the coaching badges is very poor imo. #dcfc<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@martynenglish2 Does the dog ??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martynenglish2 Beats the rain eh. Enjoy your ramble<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't think I've EVER seen Trump give a speech that makes any sense. Garbled nonsense as always.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Back down to earth tonight Matthew ?😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@roynadinprint Well that sounds a little better. Fingers crossed mate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VantiveManDCFC @Dangerous180 😅 nosey neighbour was great.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cbryson44 @RamsHeritage @dcfcofficial Goes over a grand, and you come back in a coaching role, yes ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Davebaines Its the bloody 'look how much money we've got' Kardashians 🤮🤮🤮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simon_penney Yeah, needs to go on the re-watch list 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I mean, I would call her a selfish, self-entitled c*nt. But that might be considered rude.......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spot on. 100%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@roynadinprint I wouldn't be able to concentrate if Victoria was there !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@roynadinprint Yeah, him and Mr Fry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Often mocked by the less intelligent for being 'too intelligent' - as if that could be a thing? Very funny, and intelligent, man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dangerous180 Mick and Keith and Al Pacino - brilliant 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChanyoungLee03  https://t.co/huxtAP4AJ4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikeepritch I might go and live on an island 🏝  Yes, added lots of new tracks to Spotify thanks 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikeepritch The 'jobs for the boys' culture is so sickening.  Surely they won't survive the next election.........<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Track and trace has been such a monumental fuck-up from the beginning.  Those responsible should be at the very least sacked, if not charged with endangering the public.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyalicebx You HAVE got to be kidding me!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This vexes me far more than it should. Not only does it look silly, you also get the empty cardboard noise when a cup is plonked on a table 🤬🤬🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@barmylad34 You can be Team Boris or Team Trump......what a choice 🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Davebaines Seen it now  https://t.co/VSRHIOwYvm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@garrymoore2 About the same as Lampard ! Just 'legend' status I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Solskjaer out ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VantiveManDCFC ? Youve lost me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Queenbcakess Actually their voices are quite similar. Hadn't noticed before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Queenbcakess Oh, is it? Playing it in my head now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pogba = liability<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Davebaines No 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@manx_ram 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@manx_ram Interesting. I bet your wife likes it 😄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it my ageing ears, or does this Miley Cyrus track have a Fleetwood Mac sample in it?  It’s a banger either way.  https://t.co/QUbbvTdLdH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sayradhillon 🐯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You just know the December slogan is going to be 'Eat out for Christmas'  #2ndLockdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2020 has been almost as disappointing as the last Arctic Monkeys album. #2ndLockdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenBradley  https://t.co/8olu51LPoo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stace_dcfc That's fair enough. Got his head screwed on right 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stace_dcfc I look forward to shouting abuse at him at Pride Park in the future 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scoots_n_Boots @joannefowkes The Beatles were better as they got older IMO. Early poppy stuff like 'I wanna hold your hand' is horrible. But later, drug influenced, stuff like Helter Skelter is better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luceoakley  https://t.co/otonbpPaMo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stace_dcfc Chip off the old block ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stace_dcfc He'll be setting league scoring records at this rate! Must make you proud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fuck_the_efl @joannefowkes Only 90% 😁 Some great bands around  - Arctic Monkeys,  Catfish, Royal Blood. Good music doesn't have to mean old music for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fuck_the_efl @joannefowkes Uh-oh, grandad's off on one 😁😁😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scoots_n_Boots @joannefowkes At the beginning they were seen as the 'clean-cut' alternative to The Stones by concerned parents, weren't they. Mick and the gang miles ahead for me.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joannefowkes Absolutely,  or we'd all be into Jedward 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luceoakley Wow. The old adage that you can choose your friends, but not your family eh! A blessing that he's so far away. Is he a minister or something?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tommyw96 Yeah I think he has a tendency to rub people the wrong way. Maybe its ego?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ymick60 Ouch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@M4ndylou @GayleChaddy72 Bon Jovi is a tricky one. After a few beers, an awesome singalong. Sober - very different 😁 As for the Weather Girls  - hen party fodder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joannefowkes I'm not a big fan, just 5 tracks on my Spotify. Things like Helter Skelter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luceoakley Is your uncle ok 😱  Christmas must be fun at your place !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@su4eranio 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ramsfan0285 Do people love that ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ymick60 Oh wow. Horrible song, horrible memory. Did you ever get it back?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tommyw96 Harsh !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GayleChaddy72 But your gender are meant to love that 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joannefowkes Even the less 'poppy' stuff like Come Together or Back in the USSR ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well #Whitney was a sad watch on channel 4, but a reminder of one of the greatest voices I had the pleasure of hearing live.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyZeb Controversial Andrew 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@swigger67 Oh Andrew................<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@swin_p @sjforsyth Oh shit, now I'm going to have to watch it 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stace_dcfc 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikeepritch Will improve my Sunday no end 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanPemb84232474 Another one of mine was Mull of Kintyre 🤮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanPemb84232474 Oh my god. How many people bought that fucking single......insanity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stace_dcfc ANYTHING ???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikeepritch 👍 just added several tracks on Spotify. Didn't know there was solo stuff out there !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@swin_p @sjforsyth I think I liked that at the time, mainly because I fancied the youngest sister 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Diane90310238 100% with you on that one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bedders1971 Absolutely 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gertlet Sounds horrible. Although it's Roy I feel for, having to look after himself 😁 Seriously though,  I hope you are home soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradClough10 This guy ???  https://t.co/ZTNY3PDeie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyalicebx ......and who is she???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyalicebx Well I like it. So probably 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrinderRam 🤣 I'm indifferent on that one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyalicebx Stop it Emily.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reached Oh yeah. I mean The Beatles had some great songs like Come Together and Get Back, but that is another dreary one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1968Tv @FootballArchive @alexthompson08 Absolutely feckin glorious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gertlet Yeah, it's not something to blast around the ward 🤣 Any idea how long your stay will be?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjforsyth Ah, who needs to be popular. It's overrated 😄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjforsyth OK. We will never speak again Stuart 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rik_JP1884 Oh thank goodness. I am not alone. So dreary and plodding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gertlet Good to hear you are up to it Amanda. Me and Alex enjoyed it, but the Mrs found it a bit rude 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What song do you hate with a passion, but other people love? Mine is Imagine by John Lennon.  Sorry 😞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyalicebx I think she'd understand in these trying times 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyalicebx  https://t.co/G5Z6olYK2Z<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simon_penney @iamzavagno Ah. Must re-watch.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@iamzavagno @simon_penney Where were they, I can't remember?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikeepritch Oh really. Never seen them live. She seems supremely talented and completely nuts at the same time 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perfect for #Halloween 'Off off, off with your head Dance dance, dance till your dead'  https://t.co/5BPThjZqWE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Shinnie has had an immense first half 👏 #dcfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimmyDCFC If he gets booked for the 1st, he doesn't do the 2nd one. Nip it in the bud ref.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimmyDCFC How has he not been spoken to. Very poor refereeing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fayzi_ox But there was that early album track - "For Feck's Sake, Just Score a Goal"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sjforsyth Honestly, at this point I'll take 0-0 at Bournemouth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjforsyth We could be really struggling for a decent fully fit XI . If Bournemouth are 'on it' we might be in for a hiding 😒<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Davebaines He's had a shocker there. Git.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh man, that offside replay 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It seems only Rooney is capable of taking a decent corner/free kick !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lot of mistakes in this huddersfield side. Have to punish them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simon_penney Could be your prostate Simon. Get it looked at......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lee Buchanan looks like he should be working on his geography project.....are we sure he's 19 !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jozefzoon to come off the bench and score a late winner at Forest tonight?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leegurney @dcfcofficial They'll never know what didn't hit them.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EleanorDanes Don't worry, I think we all will 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimmyDCFC He could have dislocated a finger there. Animal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simon_penney @day82_ Around a tenner through NowTV ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fowls21wwfc @SkySportsNews Perhaps there will be a 2nd division 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My 2020 in a nutshell........ If you know, you know.  https://t.co/Dsi4fA7vnT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cocu playing up front tonight ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cymru_79 You might struggle to like him in this !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveyD Oh thank god. The relief 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cymru_79 I'm kind of jealous! Enjoy catching up. Gillian is glorious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cymru_79 You've not seen ANY of it ?!?!?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyalicebx That's true....what a disgrace eh 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't watch Strictly and never have, but good on them for finally catching up with the times. As for Widdecombe, aren't dinosaurs supposed to be dead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fiestyclare Yup !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fiestyclare Oh it will all be over by then 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjforsyth Yeah, if you're gonna do a job, do it properly or don't bother. They do seem to be an especially clueless bunch we have in charge at the moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyalicebx Bet her bare arse left a sweaty patch on that vinyl seat.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cocu must be expecting a big steaming turd from Santa this year, the way things are going....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjforsyth Easter suddenly seems a long way away 😟 Gonna be a long dark winter in Kilburn, watching shit football !  https://t.co/T1bJdwF7Ov<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A song that wasn't appreciated enough at the time...  https://t.co/SAs7Al1yd7<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@adzie92 If he does that against Forest I'll be very happy 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we thought Theresa May was a shit dancer....... #trumpdance<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@luc7_dcfc @simon_penney Ha ha......of course !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simon_penney What's that son?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@manx_ram Time for another drink son 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CampervanJohn It is indeed. I'm all for a bit of 'concrete brightening' 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I steadfastly refuse to watch Strictly until they feature pogoing.  https://t.co/02Gd19Yc4g<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Interesting bridge art by the Derwent in Derby. If a local could interpret it for me?  https://t.co/GP94hvSoV3<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DCRAM73 Bring back Roos 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Decent that tbf.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rooney doing a fair impression of Chris Martin so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dcfc87 Shhhh.....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dcfc87 Very nice. She's a lucky lady.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dcfc87 About 40mins North 😁 Near Hartland Quay, North Devon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dcfc87 Except 'Barry' told me this one, so.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamzavagno Well who is to be fair !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just heard that Forsyth is up front tonight. Give him a chance boys and girls....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where did he pluck that one from? Answers on a postcard.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamzavagno 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamzavagno I have one issue - *leeches 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nav_dcfc Lots of 1-0 wins with late Rooney free-kicks 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pah, who needs goals anyway. Overrated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReeveTristan @alexstewardd Just bike tyres. Came with the chair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who dares me to let @alexstewardd go ?😁  https://t.co/MpPp8Ajce1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheWarsmith @NavrinSidhu @_omeara_r He had a good song though 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RJConway92 @JamesPearceLFC Looks at the fixtures to see when we play Cardiff. Free-kick thunderbolt incoming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They couldn't just sit quietly, eating Toblerone could they. Yodelling is bad enough, without this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well this doesn't sound good for our half term holiday near Pwllheli 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will we play England's all-time leading scorer up top tonight ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vaughanyboy I'm sure his salary helps to ease the pressure.  I'll save my tears 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vaughanyboy You're not wrong. He's VERY fortunate to be where he is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willDCFC1 @Vaughanyboy Considering the amount of money we've thrown around the last few years, Duane was an absolute bargain, and will hopefully spend a few seasons with us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vaughanyboy Don't think you're allowed to question 'Super Frank' are you ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamzavagno Bradley Johnson's going up !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheJackFrancis He may well be 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheJackFrancis Think we could all do with a boost. I had high hopes when Marriott came in, but it just hasn't panned out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dcfc87 Sorry - knee ligaments 😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dcfc87 Another prolific one !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dcfc87 Ah, I missed that. I'll keep my fingers crossed for a lovely surprise later today then 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dcfc87 Do any of the ITK's know how far away Waghorn is?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_omeara_r That evening at Elland Road suddenly feels like a long time ago 😒<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamzavagno Thanks for clearing that up Benny boy 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dcfc87 Kazim-Richards ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Marriott out. Do we think that's it for today #dcfcfans ?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@martynenglish2 But the right wing god-squad in America will continue to lap it up. Madness.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@2016industrial Well their defending has been even worse than ours lately!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reached Yeah, fancy appointing a nice guy.......bastards 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that I haven't seen a single negative tweet about him from Derby fans, would suggest that Forest have done well.  https://t.co/nXf2HPmD7w<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@manx_ram They needed one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@barmylad34 Who's Stella? Is she the new assistant manager? 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know, Forest might actually get a point or 2 with Hughton !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dcfc87 Anyone would think it was already lined up !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@livbiddle Hopefully you'll be able to enjoy the office support and comradeship soon 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@livbiddle I know absolutely nothing about social work, but I 99.9% guarantee that you are being too hard on yourself.  So many people are finding this extended home-working period difficult, and being new to such a demanding role must be extra stressful.  All the best.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rubyx7 Ooooh, new bike ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Don't be afraid of it" (except those who have already died - you can be a little afraid of it)  Only surprise is that he didn't wear a superman shirt.  Dickhead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1. An absolute disgrace 2. No surprise to anyone  🤬🤬🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who said footballers aren't bright 🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> https://t.co/JHDVpJjRaa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surprised Klopp didn't 'rage-quit' that game, and throw his controller at the 4th official.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Villa, who survived last season thanks to a VAR cock-up, are slaughtering the champions!  Who doesn't love football?  https://t.co/OKvfhWp7o1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everton to win the league then ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@manx_ram Like Derby you mean ?🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_omeara_r  https://t.co/nBbbiSF0RM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As someone who played CB for around 25yrs can I just ask what happened to defending ? Premier League has gone nuts ! #MANTOT  #AVLLIV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjforsyth Ooooh 3 Anyas, just imagine the luxury 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjforsyth Hopefully on 25% wages<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjforsyth To Derby on loan? 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjforsyth How the fuck was he smiling there. Bloody disgraceful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice and bright at Kedleston  https://t.co/uYnvhCoz2H<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Losing to Fulham at Wembley seems to have really hurt Brentford. 2-0 up at half time, and lose 2-4 to Preston !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjforsyth Ah, bless him 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boris on with #Marr this morning - yes, Eat Out to Help Out has killed people, but it's also saved jobs. It's a balance. 😳 OK Bojo 🤡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@roynadinprint Nah, he's not a doctor 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redfern_i_j @eddiebikeride Me too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eddiebikeride Oh, Nev was awesome. Not overly tall, but commanding<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, also, having watched #motd, if James Rodriguez isn't the signing of the season - who is?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, having watched #MOTD , how good could Everton be with a commanding goalkeeper?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having just caught up with #MOTD,  why is Frank Lampard so passive aggressive in his interviews? Even after a good win!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimonW_69 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Feels weird playing goal kicks inside the box on #fifa21demo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Juddy19X  https://t.co/bJQWUmEfM6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DuaneHolmes 🤣 all caught up now. Tell me you watch 'Gone Fishing' with Bob Mortimer and Paul Whitehouse?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DuaneHolmes 'Night-fishing injury' Duane ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Important to remember that this doesn't happen without Jason Knight's lung-busting run. Up the young rams.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@philw421 @sjforsyth be funny if it his their arm while they're laying down. VAR !!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElizabethSlatts Next game 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheCurtisDavies @WayneRooney  https://t.co/DoO7IGwFv5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamzavagno Can't believe they landed Rodriguez. Game changer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simon_penney @iamzavagno Being talked about by several journalists. Presumably heavy wages again though. Hope things are ok your end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@teamluca @simon_penney Wow !<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Oh shit......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VantiveManDCFC Hold on......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwearingSport It's like making them play Twister in the old folks home. "Right knee green"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now all us away fans would be singing "we've had a shot, we've had a shot" I miss it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@manx_ram And his legs 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gertlet Yes, like Taylor Swift 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chloeknowlesx Haha, yeah he was loving it 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent 45 from Curtis Davies btw. Gets a lot of stick on here. But he's been absolutely solid so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gertlet Never going to go with my 'gammon' complexion 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>45 mins away from a point. Am I dreaming?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the minority, I know, but not keen on the pink shirts. Appreciate the charity angle obviously 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We kind of look like one of those Sunday morning sides that have some older bloke up front, who used to play at a 'decent level' 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There may well be 43 shots from Norwich today !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimmyDCFC Both ladies are doing very well to put up with you. 😁<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GregLake1 @roynadinprint @1936Ram Oh man , that's terrible news. Sad day indeed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Derby twitter could get very unpleasant later. Might be best to swerve it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@emilyalicebx Is this an x-rated tweet ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmmm, sort out my sock drawer or read Jamie Redknapp's autobiography...........<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamzavagno Yesterday's was so obscene, I nearly reported it 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamzavagno Much better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottGretton Maybe when a modern footballer is obstructed, he falls to the floor and wins a foul instead ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simon_penney Bob?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottGretton Or whatever FIFA want 😒<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradClough10 What's 'ironing' ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jellis90 🤣 "but he's only got one foot on the pitch"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottGretton Yeah, I thought it had perhaps been scrapped?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradClough10 @RevRichardColes There we have to differ. Could never stand Somerville's voice. (Like a cat being abused)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is 'obstruction' still a rule in football? Never see it given anymore. (I may be thinking back to the dark ages😁)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheJackFrancis How's that pooch of yours?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheJackFrancis Hope you're doing ok Jack. Had a shitty day?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oz054 You're not alone mate, it's awful. Cancelled Sky, and can't envisage putting it back on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TamworthRam We'll all be sorry if that's the case 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StuartHughes65 We've become one of the 'easier teams' !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyMargett Sounds like you need a good clear out 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lavenderben 🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AndyMargett You alright son?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redfern_i_j Oof. I'm going for seven and keeping my fingers tightly crossed.  I don't want Cocu sacked, but I can certainly see it happening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eddiebikeride We'll have to hope they surprise us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjforsyth @sjlitchfield 0-0 then 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjforsyth 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_MatthewBrown 🤣 you've clearly not seen any of our performances!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eddiebikeride Oh man, that's unthinkable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmbroseBarnaby That could see us out of the bottom 3 !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShaunTheRam 😭<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JimmyDCFC Well that picture has ruined my week already......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KMShaw75 I only really have one mate, and we have a very similar relationship to them. One minute taking the piss, and the next talking about 'real' stuff.  Need to have more outings post-covid 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>26 days until Forest v Derby. What state will both teams be in by then ? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KMShaw75 Such a simple idea, but has worked so well. A great relationship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjforsyth Yes mate. A much needed chill<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@manx_ram Yeah it has a real nostalgic feel to it, with the stuff they talk about. A reminder of simpler times son 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@manx_ram There's just something about it. And I've never fished in my life!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McKelvie @SteveyD Amen 🙏<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you've had a shitty Saturday, cheer yourself up by listening to the new track by @royalblooduk  21st century rock gods.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TamworthRam Well he's not very mobile, so we shouldn't have to chase him 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who's going to join me for a minibus down to Bristol early tomorrow. Kidnap Chrissy Martin, and straight back home for tea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@barmylad34 Its enough to drive you to drink son<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@barmylad34 I don't mean he hasn't worked,  I mean we haven't worked for him. If I was his agent, I'd be looking elsewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@belle_esq @BarDisciple ......and everyone 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouLouRam Need a virus that targets morons. I'd clap for that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ymick60 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shelts_6 The guy is a deluded 'pied piper' who thinks the Queen is a lizard. What more do you need. Oh, and wear a fucking mask - it's not difficult.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shelts_6 Why what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope I don't know anyone that travelled to London today to listen to David 'feckin nutjob' Icke. Glad he was arrested. Twat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QuestTV @EFL  https://t.co/S8tHmVhzoi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dcfc87 Makes a change that we're not slagging the keeper off 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@manx_ram Yeah we could do with a Bradley Johnson..........<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PedrotheRam Oh christ 🙈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@manx_ram Think it will be a while before we see some of those mate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still got Chris Martin and Mason Bennett to score against us this season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WestSussexRam Yup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whatever you do #dcfcfans , don't look at the October fixtures....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a new one for Man U - getting a penalty AFTER the final whistle 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He may be England's all time leading scorer, but he's been useless today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chloeknowlesx @simon_penney Embarrassing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjforsyth Matt Clarke is easily our best defender. First outfield player on the team sheet surely?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@roynadinprint Think if I was his agent, I'd be getting busy looking elsewhere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're going to have to ship Marriott out aren't we? Just hasn't worked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remind me, who was our POTY last season?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_omeara_r Only if he brings Keogh back 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was that only 45 mins.....felt like bloody hours !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just seen Ibe at the train station. He's changed his mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WayneT70 @dcfcofficial Yes, it's depressing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Excellent tune this. When I heard the chorus, I thought it was Ellie Rowsell from Wolf Alice (no bad thing that)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The same ones abusing Bobby Duncan on here? Football fans can be so stupid<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Bloody hell, Boris holding his briefing at the same time as #bakeoff starts will upset some folk more than covid itself! #covidbriefing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@simon_penney @popsider Norwich announced a similar arrangement, but stated that any game you weren't 'selected' to attend would see the money for that game refunded to your account. Seems better/clearer than the Derby message.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simon_penney Seems the only sensible option at the moment Simon. Especially as our seats are being held until 21/22<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What's really evident with football without fans, is the amount of complaining refs put up with from players. Every bloody decision. I'd want to tell a few to feck off.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@roynadinprint Indeed. The way the shock wave moved out was incredible.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So who's ready for the dullest FACup final in history. Too hot No fans Arsenal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rotswamp @luceoakley Clear as mud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surely this should say 'child' ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gertlet Don't know, but I bet Charlton will be on the phone Monday morning!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perfect for social distancing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luceoakley Bloody hell. Hope you're planning a cooooool weekend<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Derby_Dazzler Yeah, you make a decision on what you think is best for you. It's the dramatic response from the media that winds me up. 'Holidaymakers devastated' etc. A lot of them won't bother isolating anyway!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It should be amazing that the track and trace can't differentiate between mainland Spain and the islands, but it's not. Just more basic incompetence.  #Quarantine  #Balearics<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"We Buried Paul, We Buried Paul" over and over was enough to freak you out when you were 16 , and drinking shit lager 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All part of the conspiracy that the 'real' McCartney had died years before and replaced by an impostor! Think it was either 'The Blue Album' or 'The Red Album', that if you played backwards, you could hear them all chanting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cymru_79 Yeah, the ones we listened to belonged to an older relative of one of my friends 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, who on here is old enough to remember listening to Beatles records backwards, and being freaked out by the 'hidden messages' ?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Baddiel TVC15 yes indeed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjforsyth Wembley? I was there , but I don't remember the entrance?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Only saw Bowie once, on the Glass Spider Tour at Wembley in 87. Just stood there, gobsmacked most of the time! What a catalogue.  #GlastonburyAtHome  #Glastonbury2020  #Bowie<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Still kicking myself for selling my Foo Fighters ticket for Sunderland 2015. It was the day of the playoff final, and I was convinced Derby were going to be at Wembley.  Then we lost at home to Reading on the last day and crashed out 😭<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kevinmilward 😂 It pains me when you hear people like Elton John and Rod Stewart just doing a poor impression of themselves. Its over boys, just enjoy the memories!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjforsyth Tell you what, some of the 'stuff' being sold at Glasto - I didn't have a feckin clue what they were offering me. Most of them hadn't made it to my little Leicestershire village 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@manx_ram All wanting to be lead singer in the heavenly supergroup!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@manx_ram And just a few drugs between them......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradClough10 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@manx_ram Yeah, weird one that. Many taken far too early.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@musicmeandtea He's had a busy weekend!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElizabethSlatts One example - Debbie Harry was broke and homeless after Blondie split, despite all the record sales. Bad advice and awful contracts signed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ripley_ram Yeah, very sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElizabethSlatts The music business in a nutshell. Greedy managers/executives everywhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ripley_ram Yeah, shame no-one could (or would) help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexstewardd @BradClough10 You can't not move to the rhythm Brad . It's what life is all about 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradClough10 @alexstewardd No, she loves that. Rhythm to die for me 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradClough10 Stood watching them at V Festival while @alexstewardd was thinking wtf is this old nonsense 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjforsyth 😂 Saw them a couple of times in Leicester as well. Never had the flowers hanging out of my back pocket though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always makes me sad seeing Amy Winehouse - what a terrible waste of a massive talent.  #GlastonburyAtHome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjforsyth And why is it hazy Stuart - were you perhaps taking things that weren't strictly legal? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes you just have to accept your voice has gone - Barry Gibb 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjforsyth Some good names there. The Manics are one band I missed out on seeing 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allen_robert1 Bargain !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allen_robert1 Was a much smaller affair!  Loved Ian Dury 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1984 was the only time I've done #Glastonbury  Pissed it down. Absolute mud-fest. Lived on fish finger sarnies and Skol lager. The Smiths. Had to pay a farmer to drag the car out on Monday! Marvellous.  #GlastonburyAtHome  #Glastonbury2020  #GlastonburyMemories  https://t.co/LyMWvCk8nc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GorgeousLesley Excellent effort 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IAmMarzipan Hope she's watching out for people climbing that fence to get in. Doesn't look too stable 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradClough10 Mr Blue Sky - epic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/dUxCUN0PZX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@barmylad34 Well now you're being greedy 😄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@britt_ellis @Angieeclectic @Richardmassey82 Haha , exactly what we noticed this morning.  Where's the G's 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ed__Dawes  https://t.co/sNbjGP2Ssp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@swigger67 3 games certainly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cv_hammond 😂 The Wardrobe is more entertaining<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@miss_chell87 Really is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The intro to this song is just beautiful.......  https://t.co/SQRvpjuhtr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@priceyd Obviously we're yet to find out when next season will start and what the transfer window will be. Lots of unknowns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Assuming that we stay down this time, next season shows great promise with Bird, Sibley, Bogle, and Knight all maturing nicely (Bogle is still only 19 remember.) Add Mike te Wierik for Clarke, and the return of Bielik. MUST find a keeper though. Just hope we get to go! #dcfcfans  https://t.co/67gmIGsyus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@manx_ram Sorry to hear that mate. Best to your family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_MatthewBrown Not complaining now are ya. Fickle football fans 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lingard's moustache skills are about the same as his football skills.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StuartDerbyManc The haircut obviously 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Didn't see the game,  but how did Mitrovic not get a red for this?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Phew.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad we've got easy games after this one 👀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradClough10 A twitter cleanse.  Nice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradClough10 what happened to you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oz054 Inexplicable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just catch the feckin ball !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimmyDCFC They are shite though Jim!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjforsyth Trying to remember who was coming out with the 'Cocu the clown' tweets earlier in the season!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Up the Rampant Rams 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't see my cardboard cut-out anywhere at Pride Park. I sent several in !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@barmylad34 Always 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@livesfootballs @EleanorDanes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Preston v Cardiff could stay 0-0 that would be just fine and dandy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EleanorDanes Fantastic. Sort it out @dcfcofficial 🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EleanorDanes Again! What did they tell you last week?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One year ago today @alexstewardd , you and the dog were 'setting sail.' Today we're waiting to watch Derby on tv, at an empty Pride Park. Strange times indeed 🙃  https://t.co/lNjG2MtVZW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCPolitics He's opening the pubs on a summer Saturday,  should go ok, no?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True. True.  https://t.co/0SrXg7f3Ox<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kyleguest What an horrific day that was 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gertlet Is this the first time you've tried their delivery Amanda?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm guessing no gin tonight then @emilyalicebx 😂 Enjoy whatever you are drinking. Happy Birthday 🎉  https://t.co/48100UkrLC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IanPemb84232474 100 x better than the hordes at Bournemouth 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrShaw75 Never mind. As the woman at a French market said, as she stood there laughing  - "vous avez une grande tête monsieur" 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@barmylad34 @YoufeckingIdiot I'm sure there are people who'd like to see me try 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What kind of person shits in a burger box ????  Absolute scumbags.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoufeckingIdiot @barmylad34 Oh man, I thought it was going to be tree between legs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ymick60 😂I wouldn't blame them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Gem_Szr Nice one<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@manx_ram That's not funny in the Midlands 😭😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrShaw75 Hope there's an XL for us fat heads !<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cymru_79 I want one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DuaneHolmes Can't beat that Debbie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ashleighward96 @khaismith26 Be interesting to see what happens now he's been released then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ashleighward96 @khaismith26 There you are - of course you are right. Don't know what I've been reading 😂  https://t.co/mUJDjdzPmf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ashleighward96 @khaismith26 Are you talking about friendlies or something?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ashleighward96 @khaismith26 I think you must be talking about someone else?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ashleighward96 @khaismith26 Didn't he only play 3 times, and get subbed in all 3 ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DuaneHolmes Oh you spotted the bots!😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khaismith26 *temp Premier League club 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khaismith26 Yeah, didn't sound like he was setting the world alight with the 23's. Shame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is Hepburn-Murphy still with Derby U23's ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gertlet A lot of anti-social behaviour at Chatsworth apparently.😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gertlet Seems to be a 2nd epidemic  - that of selfishness 🤬<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Gertlet Unfollow &gt; pointless argument<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrdanwalker .......and one of Boris for the dart board?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Football is just so anemic without fans. We are it's lifeblood. I hope we can get back before too long, and it would be nice if we were more appreciated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@manx_ram Even they are running out excuses!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3 months later and it's still falling the same - unbelievable Jeff<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MuttonMolester I didn't bother with the comments,  but I can probably guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well spoken that man. Not easy to criticise your own clubs fans, but it needed saying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjforsyth Me too. Although no sentence is going to help that devastated woman. I can't even imagine.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarkSpendlove Yeah hopefully.  I've struggled to raise any interest so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So having run the numbers,  I reckon football is around 70-75% less interesting without the fans. #footballsback<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArtyBagger @AndyZeb Same level of ineptitude as well !<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@iamzavagno Perhaps our great leader will surprise us (and the media) on Sunday. Then again.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamzavagno @Omar_Al_Zidjali We can all see that. Why can't the powers that be? It's not about the economy,  because that's going to be in the toilet for ages anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Omar_Al_Zidjali @iamzavagno It's inevitable I'm afraid. It's going to be party time next week for hordes of morons.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@goughy123456 Still don't know how you managed to get him in the championship!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goughy123456 Just had to sit back and applaud really. One of the best goals I've seen live.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patswolves @TimSpiers  https://t.co/P6AoUF1kxq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goughy123456 Indeed. I miss going to Wolves (except when Neves smashes in a worldie against us from 25 yards 😱)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goughy123456 @EmmaW1977 @JPercyTelegraph Yeah, he does come across very well in interviews. Proper 'players manager'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmmaManzini I don't understand - there's no mention of chips anywhere. She's doing it wrong!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goughy123456 @EmmaW1977 @JPercyTelegraph Be interesting to know what the players think about returning. All have families to think about, which is more important than anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/t2g1vlP1Xi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamwwfc03 @JPercyTelegraph Maybe. Not a pop at Wolves at all, just dont think the restart is feasible. I know the prem are desperate to restart, but I think it's over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's at it again - absolute fuckwit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dinglouis_ @JPercyTelegraph We're one of the few countries that don't implement that. You would have to ask the government why.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamwwfc03 @JPercyTelegraph More concerned about the non-playing staff who will have to go in (and their families)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QuicklyOrigi @JPercyTelegraph I bet his garden is big enough 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmmaW1977 @JPercyTelegraph We don't do that apparently. But it's ok, Boris says we're winning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gazhughes89 @JPercyTelegraph Yes I know, but it's just football. As much as we love it, sport has to wait imo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JPercyTelegraph I know some footballers think a lot of themselves,  but they are NOT essential workers. This seems idiotic.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@musicmeandtea Not nice. I don't know how they expect to implement social distancing when schools open.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SteveyD What about non-basketball fans ?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kjwood7533 My favourite would probably change every day. When a band has so many top tracks,  it depends what mood you're in that day.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_omeara_r And now we will never know 😒<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cymru_79 @ladbible Yeah, I feel for anyone going through it. On the lighter side, I got used to my mother complaining about the giant salmon that one of the carers had put under her bed!😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimmyDCFC Mad rush for tickets, away day in the sun, clinching 6th place......😭😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_omeara_r NOT BIRMINGHAM ? And you have the temerity to call yourself a Derby fan 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cymru_79 @ladbible I think the hardest thing sometimes is not to shout. You learn to scream inwardly 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirchyN85 Exactly this. Some of the play in the world cup was shockingly bad. Of course it's not going to pull in the same money. It might do, some time in the future, but the product has to be much better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ladbible @cymru_79 Brings back some very unpleasant memories, but an important film for those who have no idea what goes on.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Is he talking about Boris, because that is arse-licking of the highest order.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevinmilward Be better if Christians were more accepting of other faiths. I'd vote Sikhs no.1 in 'Faith Idol' - incredibly welcoming people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevinmilward It was difficult to keep 2 metres apart - a lot of middle-class white folk, who only attend twice a year 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevinmilward You could. I don't have a problem with anyone's personal beliefs, it just seems at bit weird at times for millions of people to be celebrating something they don't actually believe in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevinmilward I know what you're saying,  but those people can still go to church. Just think we've moved on so much, it seems a bit silly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamzavagno Oh wow. And they say you can't get 'feels' with video games. It's like me everytime I see Will Hughes on FIFA 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Controversy time - shouldn't we just scrap Easter? There must be a tiny % of the population that actually believe the Easter story. You can hold on to your eggs - we can just have a Festival of Chocolate instead. #EasterSunday  #chocolateforbreakfast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamzavagno We'd better put that down to the stress of the last couple of weeks 😃<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MuttonMolester Ffs. It's a good job we're not allowed guns, because I might be tempted to go on a f*ckin rampage. Feeling a little Michael Douglas in 'Falling Down' 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ymick60 @brightsideram Yeah, the media don't help<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brightsideram Do none of these people have family or friends who work for the NHS ! Are they that oblivious?<|endoftext|>
