<|startoftext|>@AndrewFannnn @FareedZakaria @realDonaldTrump You do t get the point... states verify signatures.  States‚Äô rights.

<|startoftext|>@AndrewFannnn @FareedZakaria @realDonaldTrump Wrong.  States have the constitutional responsibility to verify.  That method could be signature, copy of ID, witness signature or notary.   It‚Äôs obvious you don‚Äôt know shit about mail in voting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewFannnn @FareedZakaria @realDonaldTrump Indonesia, South Korea and Sri Lanka. Postal ballots were not available in most African and Caribbean countries, and not available in any Middle Eastern or Latin American countries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewFannnn @FareedZakaria @realDonaldTrump FALSE. Mail in voting is common  Postal ballots were used most widely in Europe and North America and are also common in some countries in the Asia-Pacific region, such as India, Indonesia, South Korea and Sri Lanka.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewFannnn @FareedZakaria @realDonaldTrump The US has had mail in voting since civil war.  Oregon went exclusively to mail in voting 2000; Washington and Colorado now do too.  Most states offer it now.  Military has done it since civil war. Many lawmakers do it including TRUMP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewFannnn @FareedZakaria @realDonaldTrump Please. Trump has lost at least 30 ‚Äúfraud‚Äù lawsuits because his Rudy team has no evidence of fraud! Recounts confirm Biden won.

<|startoftext|>@DailyCaller @PressSec False.  You are revision history.    In 2016, after being defeated by Trump, Hillary Clinton gave a concession speech the day after the election. ‚ÄúWe owe him an open mind and the chance to lead‚Äù<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marklevinshow @PressSec It was unprofessional.  This administration has been the most unprofessional in my life time and it is a MAJOR REASON WHY TRUMP LOST!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rmgeller @mattsingley @Steph_Pear @VENTURASHERIFF Looks like Texas has its own problems dealing with the virus.

<|startoftext|>@rmgeller @mattsingley @Steph_Pear @VENTURASHERIFF Actually if we did what other countries did EARLY we would not had to lockdown.

<|startoftext|>@DarrenWells5 @HKrassenstein @JoeBiden I didn‚Äôt vote for Trump. Peaceful protesters were met with Trump‚Äôs urging for them to be fired.  Remember??  All he does is dog whistles.

<|startoftext|>@Thor_JaneFoster f‚Äôing maddening. other occasions I had to delete tweets. I don‚Äôt recall what I said now but it wasn‚Äôt inciting violence or quoting racist police chiefs. They are allowing trump because he‚Äôs president. Look at his acct. crazy. Unhinged.  ...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Thor_JaneFoster Unequal Treatment. I had another account out in twitter jail without reason.

<|startoftext|>@taylorswift13 @TheDemCoalition @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs even worse than it sounds because he is quoting a racist police chief from the 60‚Äôs.  It‚Äôs a dog whistle to the racists.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nasescobar316 I understand but people voted for him. He‚Äôs the presumptive nominee. Has he learned? I think so. In comparison Trump still thinks the Central Park 5 are guilty.

<|startoftext|>@GBatschkewitz @LilaGraceRose @WmSumnerScott @realDonaldTrump They can adopt!!   There are over 100k children in US waiting to be adopted.  400K in foster care.  If all the good #prolife Christians wanted to truly ‚Äúsave the babies‚Äù there wouldn‚Äôt be ANY kids waiting for a forever home. Sad you all are such hypocrites.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GBatschkewitz @LilaGraceRose @WmSumnerScott @realDonaldTrump Sorry but that‚Äôs complete bullshit.   Millions of embryos are destroyed. Your hypocrisy is showing. Just be honest. It‚Äôs really about controlling women. Otherwise you‚Äôd be at IVF clinics protesting and demanding laws stop the destruction!  https://t.co/KYcmcunglu<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GBatschkewitz @LilaGraceRose @WmSumnerScott @realDonaldTrump Some women need to take birth control for other medical reasons not just to prevent pregnancy.  Those uses would be outlawed.  Like any medication not everyone can take it but that‚Äôs between the woman and her physician NOT THE GOVERNMENT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GBatschkewitz @LilaGraceRose @WmSumnerScott @realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs not my argument.  Please tell me why you and Lila are not fighting to stop the deaths of fetuses at the hands of men?  Where‚Äôs the outrage about these lost fetuses.  The Prolife movement does nothing to help real victims.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GBatschkewitz @LilaGraceRose @WmSumnerScott @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs not a disagreement in the medical field.  Pregnancy is only when the zygote has implanted.    If it‚Äôs at fertilization then where‚Äôs the outrage of the lost embryos due to IVF?  Or the approx 50% expelled before implementation?? It‚Äôs about control.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GBatschkewitz @LilaGraceRose @WmSumnerScott @realDonaldTrump Pregnancy is when the zygote has implanted.

<|startoftext|>@WHVSNWO @GOPChairwoman But according to Trumpers, Subsidies for farmers hurt by TRUMP‚Äôs trade war and tariffs (taxes paid by US consumers) are NOT SOCIALISM??! Huh?

<|startoftext|>@WHVSNWO @GOPChairwoman Republicans think things that use tax dollars to help people like them are NOT socialism.

<|startoftext|>@KathyLo128 @Jinded @alllibertynews @CobieKenobi @justinamash Women of all races and ethnicities choose abortion.

<|startoftext|>@real_darrin @alllibertynews @justinamash @AOC BYW what is the source of this graph?   I can make a graph but it doesn‚Äôt make it factual.  Cite source or go home!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@real_darrin @alllibertynews @justinamash @AOC Climate change‚Äôs negative effects on plants will eventually outweigh gains from elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide levels! Heat, changes in rain pattern/drought, humans slashing &amp; burning forests. Not only CO2! Gases incl methane &amp; Nitrous oxide.   https://t.co/MdFGsFTqpp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@real_darrin @alllibertynews @justinamash @AOC You‚Äôre the one ‚Äúcherry picking‚Äù.  What are your credentials‚Äîdo you have a degree in climate science? did you NOT read the links I attached? NASA has lots of info/studies supporting it &amp; 97+ climate scientists agree. We should disregard them tho, right?    https://t.co/speqyASvyS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@real_darrin @alllibertynews @justinamash @AOC ... that rising CO2 might offer plant life.  There are a lot of different pathways by which temperature can negatively affect crop yield: soil moisture deficit [or] heat directly damaging the plants and interfering with their reproductive process.  üëá   https://t.co/5PqfULAKuP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@real_darrin @alllibertynews @justinamash @AOC ignoring the long-term outlook...many skeptics also fail to mention the potentially most harmful outcome of rising atmospheric CO2 on vegetation: climate change itself. Its negative consequences‚Äîsuch as drought and heat stress‚Äîwould likely overwhelm any direct benefits...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@real_darrin @alllibertynews @justinamash @AOC So NASA scientists aren‚Äôt as smart as you? Climate change is@more than CO2. You aren‚Äôt taking into account increasing temps.    ‚ÄúStudies have shown that plants acclimatize, or adjust, to rising carbon dioxide concentration and the fertilization effect diminishes over time.‚Äù<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@king_marmot @CatoInstitute @MomsDemand Sure.   All for that.    Republicans stein control of senate and executive branch.   Democrats will support.   Go push your legislators!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@king_marmot @CatoInstitute @MomsDemand Americans are 128 times more likely to be killed in everyday gun violence than by any act of international terrorism.

<|startoftext|>@king_marmot @CatoInstitute @MomsDemand It was wrong to imply that because mom‚Äôs demand wants common sense gun control laws that they want to take away her pistoll.  How about you review what legislation they are fighting for.     https://t.co/GmgY16JkPc<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@king_marmot @CatoInstitute @MomsDemand Your message is directed at a pro-gun control group (&amp; you‚Äôre apparently against gun control).    Ok, it‚Äôs about ‚Äúclass‚Äù but not the way you‚Äôre trying to depict.  People impacted by gun violence are not the wealthy, they are often poor and middle class.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@king_marmot @CatoInstitute @MomsDemand Mass shooters are NOT liberators.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@king_marmot @CatoInstitute @MomsDemand So you‚Äôre turning a message honoring a liberator into a pro-gun message? Pathetic.  Weapons are considerably advanced from mid-1800s. She carried a‚Äùsmall pistol‚Äù which would not be used for mass shootings.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jennijollyjoy @MALCOLM19061 @stevensoileau1 @RDavisJ1 I have experienced it. My brother had a brain bleed. He did not have a DNR.

<|startoftext|>@jennijollyjoy @MALCOLM19061 @stevensoileau1 @RDavisJ1 That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about.  If the person says ‚Äúdon‚Äôt extend my life‚Äù then that‚Äôs what they do.  However if they are still mentally sound and conscious they can verbally revoke it.  That‚Äôs what a friend‚Äôs father did. He had a DNR, but revoked in hospital.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MALCOLM19061 @jennijollyjoy @stevensoileau1 @RDavisJ1 Exactly.  We had to fight with private health ins company to obtain tests and prescriptions but not with parents‚Äô Medicare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennijollyjoy @MALCOLM19061 @stevensoileau1 @RDavisJ1 And I totally disagree that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúculture of death‚Äù.  My experience is it‚Äôs a‚Äùculture of artificially extending life‚Äù even when quality of life is gone. Continuing care when no Q of L is cruel; only benefits the survivors and is selfish. God‚Äôs plan right?  Being ‚Äúcalled home‚Äù?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennijollyjoy @MALCOLM19061 @stevensoileau1 @RDavisJ1 I have.  Sounds like a problem with specific care providers not GOVT healthcare like MEDICARE. You know if they have DNR, docs do limit care based on the person‚Äôs wishes.  Just because you didn‚Äôt agree doesn‚Äôt mean the elderly person wanted to their extend life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennijollyjoy @MALCOLM19061 @stevensoileau1 @RDavisJ1 Then the issue was with the PRIVATE health insurance, not government Medicare.  My parents and grandparents, even those who are staunch Republicans, would not give up Medicare if given the choice. They do pay for ‚Äúgap‚Äù ins coverage but they all are happy with it and their care.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GaleKrum @realDonaldTrump Trump has added more than $2 trillion to national debt.    One important difference between Trump's debt figures and Obama's is that Trump has added a massive amount of debt while the US economy has been strong, whereas Obama took over during the depths of the financial crisis.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@crosbyspencer1 @DonovanWrites @PeterDe32495700 @DineshDSouza You understand that perpetrators of mass shootings aren‚Äôt deterred by death penalty right?  It‚Äôs rare they live.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Oh I see. You have zero intentions to strengthen background checks or really do anything to prevent mass shootings! And your ‚Äúdeath penalty ‚Äú push is meaningless.

<|startoftext|>@EffieWilson828 @OzGoofyPrincess @pkcallan @LilaGraceRose It is not murder because it is not a person no matter how much you want it to be. PEOPLE have a right to life, but NOBODY has right to live inside another‚Äôs body especially when doing so poses a threat to that person‚Äôs body (&amp; potentially HER LIFE), which pregnancy does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EffieWilson828 @OzGoofyPrincess @pkcallan @LilaGraceRose I don‚Äôt know what you saw but if it‚Äôs even remotely true unlikely it was an abortion performed in us.

<|startoftext|>@EffieWilson828 @OzGoofyPrincess @pkcallan @LilaGraceRose Here‚Äôs another article by a prolife attorney.     https://t.co/EyaoNyx3qO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EffieWilson828 @OzGoofyPrincess @pkcallan @LilaGraceRose Maybe I should have used ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù instead of ‚Äúaccountable‚Äù but I disagree that if we as a society want fewer abortions (which I do) men should be held accountable for their actions.  As soon as society does that, we will have fewer abortions and likely less abandonment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EffieWilson828 @OzGoofyPrincess @pkcallan @LilaGraceRose Here‚Äôs an article written by a woman who was abandoned by her father. None of these abortion bans even remotely hold the men responsible for their actions.  That is morally wrong.    https://t.co/FIz0ZXnopA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EffieWilson828 @OzGoofyPrincess @pkcallan @LilaGraceRose I‚Äôm talking about impregnating the woman. Men can easily prevent pregnancy by using a condom.  Christians demonize woman for getting pregnant but not men.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EffieWilson828 @OzGoofyPrincess @pkcallan @LilaGraceRose And men? One man can impregnate hundreds of women in a year yet you place the moral burden to prevent pregnancy is on the woman.  men should be held accountable for recklessly impregnating women!

<|startoftext|>@StormBringerIXI @alllibertynews @RuffPhillips @LiberVindicator @LPNational Ok but he‚Äôs dead and died before republicans lost House... so?  Honestly I don‚Äôt think GOP ever had a plan except destroy ACA.  Problem is that leaves millions uninsured and uninsurable (loss of PEC protection).  That‚Äôs not what majority wants even republicans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smallmthbass @StormBringerIXI @alllibertynews @RuffPhillips @LiberVindicator @LPNational None of us have more of a claim to anything here than another.

<|startoftext|>@smallmthbass @StormBringerIXI @alllibertynews @RuffPhillips @LiberVindicator @LPNational That‚Äôs not how you sound. You‚Äôre not interested in understanding another person‚Äôs perspective.  You keep throwing ‚Äútrigger‚Äù words in an attempt to get a reaction; not playing this game.  Good day.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@smallmthbass @StormBringerIXI @alllibertynews @RuffPhillips @LiberVindicator @LPNational I‚Äôm not for open borders. I‚Äôm against creating policies based on false political narrative. The Right is using the migrant issue to push a ‚Äúagainst the others‚Äù narrative. Better to help fix underlying issues in those countries to stop migration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smallmthbass @StormBringerIXI @alllibertynews @RuffPhillips @LiberVindicator @LPNational Oxymoron. That is just political right wing rhetoric to divide our country.  We shouldn‚Äôt fall for it. I also don‚Äôt take kindly being implied that I‚Äôm a fascist.  I am not. How about we use the term correctly and denounce all forms fascism from groups and politicians?  https://t.co/xQiC2vlWsM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StormBringerIXI @alllibertynews @RuffPhillips @LiberVindicator @LPNational Please dig dipper and find out why dems haven‚Äôt been supportive.

<|startoftext|>@StormBringerIXI @alllibertynews @RuffPhillips @LiberVindicator @LPNational Sorry but you‚Äôre buying into the republicans revisionist history on ACA.

<|startoftext|>@smallmthbass @StormBringerIXI @alllibertynews @RuffPhillips @LiberVindicator @LPNational Racism was the primary reason for many of the ‚Äúimmigration‚Äù laws passed.

<|startoftext|>@TDSRecovery @carriestienen @prageru @LilaGraceRose When did I say that?   And you‚Äôre wrong.  Are you not familiar with the Hyde Amendment?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@prageru The Texas (Abortion) law had been declared unconstitutional in an earlier federal district court case (United States v. Vuitch, 1971). Wade (DA of Dallas County) ignored the decision and both sides appealed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@prageru This does not matter.   It is a medical procedure between doctor and patient, not government.  As a conservative you too should be against government intervening in people‚Äôs private medical decisions.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TDSRecovery @carriestienen @prageru @LilaGraceRose My position (&amp; that of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists) is politicians need to stay out of the doctor-patient exam room.

<|startoftext|>@TDSRecovery @carriestienen @prageru @LilaGraceRose My mistake. Regardless I don‚Äôt see why place matters.    There are medical conditions.  Ex. Ectopic pregnancy in some cases.  If woman with cancer, delays treatment until after birth like the one in Columbia - both mother and fetus died because treatment was delayed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TDSRecovery @carriestienen @prageru @LilaGraceRose What difference does it make where the procedure is performed?   You‚Äôre shifting the topic.  Now it‚Äôs where performed is the issue?  Bizarre.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TDSRecovery @carriestienen @prageru @LilaGraceRose There‚Äôs a difference between right and wrong and morality based on religious teachings.    And what about the mother‚Äôs life?

<|startoftext|>@P123Tym @WolfKingDice3 @prageru @maziehirono Asylees can‚Äôt vote.  Better to stop flow at source bc once they are here in US detention, we pay for housing, care.

<|startoftext|>@P123Tym @WolfKingDice3 @prageru @maziehirono Wall does nothing to stop flow; just slows it down.

<|startoftext|>@JohnYeasu @alllibertynews @justinamash @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Yes but there‚Äôs nothing requiring the states to work with ICE beyond sharing fingerprints (my understanding  could be wrong); otherwise there‚Äôs no legal obligation for states to assist ICE.

<|startoftext|>@JohnYeasu @alllibertynews @justinamash @POTUS @realDonaldTrump That may be true;I don‚Äôt know.

<|startoftext|>@JohnYeasu @alllibertynews @justinamash @POTUS @realDonaldTrump when you look at the stats the current increases are asylum seekers, not ‚Äúillegals‚Äù.

<|startoftext|>@JohnYeasu @alllibertynews @justinamash @POTUS @realDonaldTrump True. the wall argument by most folks mingles the two which confuses the issue.

Just my opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnYeasu @alllibertynews @justinamash @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôve addressed that.  Read article below.   It‚Äôs been blown out of proportion.

We need a guest worker program that checks them out and allows temporary status (seasonal).  Have you heard of Alabama‚Äôs and Georgia‚Äôs failed strict ant-immigration laws? Millions in crop losses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnYeasu @alllibertynews @justinamash @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Fed law can‚Äôt stop states from providing benefits beyond fed benefits.  Fed welfare already prohibits illegals from welfare.  SCOTUS ruled states must provide schooling.  Sanctuary laws don‚Äôt prevent finger prints from being shared with ICE.     https://t.co/osMsz91w8U<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnYeasu @alllibertynews @justinamash @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Employers should be penalized if they aren‚Äôt using e verify (they get off easy now) but that‚Äôs a different problem than asylum seekers.  Once asylum is granted the are legally and can work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnYeasu @alllibertynews @justinamash @POTUS @realDonaldTrump If we don‚Äôt help them their citizens will keep coming.  So your *response* is short sighted and ineffectual...obviously since they keep coming.  Just being real here.  A wall won‚Äôt stop them (slow them down but not stop them).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnYeasu @alllibertynews @justinamash @POTUS @realDonaldTrump As a signatory to the 1967 Protocol, and through U.S. immigration law, the US has legal obligations to provide protection to those who qualify as refugees.  #fixImmagrationLaw  #AsylumSeekers    https://t.co/vxwKvKP7oI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnYeasu @alllibertynews @justinamash @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Nope.  Asylum seeker will still come. Need to fix our immigration laws.  Asylum seekers have rights!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnYeasu @alllibertynews @justinamash @POTUS @realDonaldTrump FYI.  Like this and it‚Äôll increase just like when Europe closed down land crossings the migrants then went by boat.  Real solution is to solve the economic and violence issues in their homelands.  Fix issues at source.  ü§ì   https://t.co/59xoiy3ufT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnYeasu @alllibertynews @justinamash @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Besides for asylum seekers they intend to turn themselves into border patrol. That‚Äôs what they‚Äôve been doing.  You didn‚Äôt know that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnYeasu @alllibertynews @justinamash @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Lol. The migrant caravan traveled about 2500 miles further to get to Tijuana instead of closest US crossing.  You don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll go to gulf or at Tijuana get a boat or just swim?  Not familiar with migrants crossing to Italy by boat?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnYeasu @alllibertynews @justinamash @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Side note:  studies have shown more guns higher suicide rate.  In Australia, suicide decreased 74% after gun control implemented (buyback).    https://t.co/phRmCsHXua<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnYeasu @alllibertynews @justinamash @POTUS @realDonaldTrump So you don‚Äôt think illegals will find other avenues to get into US?

<|startoftext|>@Vanessa1971 @kathycrhs @powersj_tx @GOP @tedcruz California had a similar issue.  The abortion law signed by Reagan prevented homicide charges when fetus killed (like NY case).

<|startoftext|>@Vanessa1971 @GOP @tedcruz Sadly people have to make this decision every day.   My family had to; it was horrible but we felt it would be inhumane to leave our loved one hooked up for years without any chance for improvement.   Personal decision.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 @KamalaHarris @AOC 1970, Legislators corrected a similar issue in CA. Reagan‚Äôs initial law prevented a man from being charged with homicide.

<|startoftext|>@Awithonelison @passionflower92 I doubt it.  they don‚Äôt value the life of the mother.  She is a vessel to carry the fetus to term no matter what (her health issues &amp; life doesn‚Äôt matter).  Solutions to reduce abortions (free contraception; healthcare; child care) are always lacking.  So the real reason is??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Awithonelison @passionflower92 Yeah... just scrolled through his TL.   Another Gilead believer ... women are for reproducing and men‚Äôs pleasure, not to have a life of her own and she cannot make her own decisions...  https://t.co/DKKnPRxRN3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MontlakeMan @Awithonelison @passionflower92 In your opinion, if the pregnancy were to kill the mother but they could save the fetus (incubator etc) then she should die?  Or is it ok for her to choose her life and end the pregnancy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MontlakeMan @Awithonelison @passionflower92 But only for the fetus?    Then you know the US has the worst maternal mortality rate of developed nations?  Wouldn‚Äôt it make more sense to fix the cause? Better healthcare, free/low cost contraception, better child care, pay equality? Are you pushing for that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MontlakeMan @Awithonelison @passionflower92 Maybe I don‚Äôt understand your concern or distrust of our medical professionals.  Do you go to the doctor?  Are you a Seventh Day Adventist?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MontlakeMan @Awithonelison @passionflower92 .. the law states the following.   (To assume thr ar mad doctors performing abortions Willy-Nilly is ridiculous)  ‚ÄúAfter the 12th week, the procedure must be in hospital on in-patient basis. After the 20th week, an M.D. must be present to handle medical care of any live birth.‚Äù<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MontlakeMan @Awithonelison @passionflower92 My point still stands‚ÄîOBGYNs don‚Äôt diagnose mental health conditions.

<|startoftext|>@MontlakeMan @Awithonelison @passionflower92 You‚Äôre a man right? No offense but I think it‚Äôs safe to assume you‚Äôve never been to an OBGYN?  All I‚Äôve been to are geared at protecting the pregnancy and first approach immediately is that the pregnancy is wanted.  That‚Äôs the way convo goes.  even at PP; not abortion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MontlakeMan @Awithonelison @passionflower92 Sorry I don‚Äôt read it that way.  It states ‚Äúmother‚Äôs health‚Äù &amp; to expand it to ‚Äúmental health‚Äù is a stretch.  OBGYNs don‚Äôt diagnose mental health conditions; psychologists/psychiatrists do.   The OBGYN would refer to mental health professionals.    https://t.co/RYpskkga7q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@STARBSAM @LiveAction Yeah... murderers  In addition to physicians, it permits licensed nurse practitioners, physician assistants and licensed midwives to provide abortion services.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MontlakeMan @Awithonelison @passionflower92 Be careful of the rhetoric.  The NY law permits abortion only: Within the first 24 weeks or after 24 weeks if necessary to preserve the mother's health or if the fetus isn't viable.    https://t.co/RYpskkga7q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Women are dying but there‚Äôs no outrage. ‚Äú..every year in the U.S., 700 to 900 women die from pregnancy or childbirth-related causes...65,000 nearly die ...the worst record in the developed world.‚Äù While infant deaths have declined.  #MaternalMortality    https://t.co/btaGud1LKB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@silverkait @KamalaHarris Yet every year in the U.S., 700 to 900 women die from pregnancy or childbirth-related causes, and some 65,000 nearly die ‚Äî by many measures, the worst record in the developed world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@silverkait @KamalaHarris You‚Äôre wrong... most preventable:  But in the U.S., maternal deaths increased from 2000 to 2014. In a recent analysis by the CDC Foundation, nearly 60 percent of such deaths are preventable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@silverkait @KamalaHarris Where‚Äôs the outrage? Nothing like with ‚Äúsaving the babies‚Äù.  Yes life choices impact our health but more could be done to lower those risks (obviously since all other developed nations have).  Christians should be fighting for healthcare to save lives. Why aren‚Äôt you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MontlakeMan @Awithonelison @passionflower92 Hypothetical:  So if the fetus or delivery causes the death of the woman but if she had an abortion she would not have died, isn‚Äôt that baby responsible for the woman‚Äôs death?  #maternalMortality  https://t.co/e5kfROFwip<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@all4catholicism @Awithonelison @passionflower92 @MontlakeMan I‚Äôve already shared a few articles proving my point from current and past Popes apologizing for the atrocities the church over the centuries.  Shameful you‚Äôre not acknowledging these acts.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@all4catholicism @Awithonelison @passionflower92 @MontlakeMan if you were a good Christian you wouldn‚Äôt judge the woman; you wouldn‚Äôt make statements like ‚Äúcries out for justice‚Äù instead you would pray for her; you would volunteer w/orgs that help disadvantaged/escaping violence; support Medicaid expansion/healthcare &amp; low cost childcare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@all4catholicism @Awithonelison @passionflower92 @MontlakeMan You are very judgmental in your responses and ‚Äúcries out for justice‚Äù.  That‚Äôs not ‚Äúforgiving‚Äù at all.

<|startoftext|>@all4catholicism @Awithonelison @passionflower92 @MontlakeMan Untrue... the Old Testament is indeed Sacred Scripture and that the God of the Old Testament is the God of Jesus Christ.

<|startoftext|>@Chicken_Wing88 @6bottoms @Alt_FedEmployee @StuPolitics @BarbaraMain07 Actually immigration from Mexico has gone down bc their unemployment is 3.4%.

<|startoftext|>@all4catholicism @Awithonelison @passionflower92 @MontlakeMan The point is your religion does not have a right to dictate what I decide to do with my body or be in doctor exam room.

<|startoftext|>@listermom @KamalaHarris Ok.  Where is the outrage that US has the worst maternal mortality rate of developed nations?  You want babies? Push legislators to improve care to women.  You want fewer abortions?  Push legislators to provide low cost or free contraception.    https://t.co/7iLopNXssA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vividwings @all4catholicism @passionflower92 @MontlakeMan We even need consent to use a dead person‚Äôs organs to save others.  Yet anti abortion folks want government to control a woman‚Äôs decision to have a child or to save her life or to end a pregnancy when the fetus is dead.  Hm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@passionflower92 @Awithonelison @all4catholicism @MontlakeMan That‚Äôs true sadly.  The same folks who are anti-abortion are typically also the same folks that don‚Äôt want homosexual couples to adopt children.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@all4catholicism @MontlakeMan @passionflower92 A fetus is a fetus, a baby is a baby.   There‚Äôs a difference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MontlakeMan You didn‚Äôt read the law.  What far right fake news did you get this idea from??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewsDhm I guess you missed the question marks?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewsDhm And you are fake news based.   I am suspicious of government regulating my private decisions between me and my doctor.    Besides again if you want fewer abortions make access to contraception easy, low cost or free.  Also support access to prenatal care (yes FREE).  God Bless!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveFeen1 @HarveyJ2 @NjMellie Asylum seekers are not breaking our laws regardless what the president keeps saying.

<|startoftext|>@prageru @realDonaldTrump @stephenharper Nationalist.  You know there was another leader who was a nationalist... hm who was that again??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewsDhm I personally don‚Äôt believe SCOTUS, even a conservative one, will overturn Roe.  They value precedent and durability of law.  Besides if overturned and stricter states‚Äô laws take effect then the voters will fight to change their state laws by voting progressives in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewsDhm RBG is a nonissue.   If SCOTUS overturned Roe then the legality of abortion goes back to the states.  NY knows this and fixed old law so that women /healthcare providers won‚Äôt be charged with criminal abortion in a worse case scenario.  You know State‚Äôs rights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewsDhm ... No new fetal tissue has been used to keep the cell culture going; the use of this cell line isn‚Äôt leading to new abortions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewsDhm The cells, called HEK 293 cells ... were taken from an aborted fetus in the 1970s in the Netherlands...are very easy to work with and have become workhorses of cellular biology. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre used in the development of drugs and vaccines. ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewsDhm You‚Äôre suspicious of rape, incest and harm to the mother? So you want the Government to control women‚Äôs decisions about her life and sometimes that of her doctor? You‚Äôre ok with the Government forcing a woman to carry a fetus that‚Äôs the result of rape or incest?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewsDhm I don‚Äôt know what you mean by ‚Äútoilet abortion‚Äù.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewsDhm And still is but not against the women or health care provider.   Is that the issue?  You want women and health care providers charged with homicide for abortion?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MouthyOldBat @KamalaHarris Completely agree.  Where are the religious right‚Äôs marches to protect the women?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@listermom @KamalaHarris I  never said the article stated the religious right was the cause.  I‚Äôm saying the Religious Right is more concerned about a fetus than women dying for a vareity if reasons.  Am I wrong?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarveyJ2 @NjMellie @SteveFeen1 A fetus is not a citizen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewsDhm Were you concerned about the woman being charged with criminal abortion if the law stayed in the penal code?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewsDhm Instead an attacker would be charged with first -degree assault which has heavier penalty than criminal abortion.   What it does prevent is the woman from being charged with criminal abortion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewsDhm The change is meant to protect women and the healthcare provider but NY Republicans have offered proposals for new legal penalties in cases where pregnant women are assaulted.  So if there it‚Äôs an issue they‚Äôll fix it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewsDhm You are wrong.  Code SectionPub. Health Section 2599-AA (Sec 4164 is repealed) Statutory Definition of Illegal AbortionAs of Jan. 22, 2019, ABORTION is no longer in the state's penal code. This means health care providers acting in good faith may not be held criminally liable.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OHCATruth @prageru Whereas ‚ÄúSMM has been steadily increasing in recent years and affected more than 50,000 women in the United States in 2014.‚Äù  So literally being pregnant can kill the woman!  Done.    https://t.co/Tcw9e5Zxut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OHCATruth @prageru Your shifting... but Ok there are medical concerns with taking any drug.  Are you as concerned about mother mortality?

<|startoftext|>@OHCATruth @prageru That‚Äôs hilarious. Talk about shifting...I‚Äôm saying if the right wants fewer abortions support low cost /free birth control. Not pushing on anyone ... unlike you who apparently wants to make abortions illegal!   See?  You reject valid studies bc they don‚Äôt support your VIEW.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OHCATruth @prageru I think you need to go back to my original comment.  I believe that abortion decision is between woman, physicians, and whoever else she wants involved BUT NOT THE GOVT.  In US it is not illegal up to the point of viability, or harm to women or fetus isn‚Äôt viable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NjMellie @SteveFeen1 @HarveyJ2 It depends on the state...appears to exclude legally obtained abortions with women‚Äôs consent.  I say ‚Äúappears‚Äù bc I didn‚Äôt read all..  https://t.co/Qqhr5uj0Kx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OHCATruth @prageru Here‚Äôs another... In fact, based on our calculations in Table 3, changes in contraceptive policy simulating the Contraceptive CHOICE Project would prevent as many as 41% to 71% of abortions performed annually in the U.S.  https://t.co/x2WQiPuy2S<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OHCATruth @prageru Birth control is regulated... prescribed by doctor?   Approved by FDA??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OHCATruth @prageru I always find it interesting how the right rejects studies because it challenges their beliefs.   There have been other studies.  US News article presented the information well.    Here‚Äôs another...    https://t.co/H3rOc0PEzT<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GrandsRising @HarijainD @realDonaldTrump Work programs?  Specifically??    I‚Äôm talking about a reforming immigration laws; Not accepting illegals.   Our system has a lot of issues.  Let‚Äôs not overly focus on one solution (wall), let‚Äôs look at comprehensive fixes.   https://t.co/BvxI6vmcdh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrandsRising @HarijainD @realDonaldTrump We have to be careful of unintended consequences.  Fact is US needs migrant workers. We need immigration law reform. Georgia passed strict anti-illegals law.  Result? estimated $140 million in agricultural losses, as crops rotted in the fields ...   https://t.co/7eS5f9BQSU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrandsRising @HarijainD @realDonaldTrump We know the range based on data.  Many studies have been conducted and research corroborates results.  This is from nonpartisan Pew...    https://t.co/cY3hHYywK8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrandsRising @HarijainD @realDonaldTrump More details and fact checking Delay‚Äôs, Trump‚Äôs claims ...it‚Äôs linked to sources.  I‚Äôve read numerous other sources saying same this one is just nicely laid out.     https://t.co/JIjeeuL1eY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrandsRising @HarijainD @realDonaldTrump BTW...‚Äùthe 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, also barred unauthorized immigrants from drawing benefits.‚Äù -Clinton signed law<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrandsRising @HarijainD @realDonaldTrump There are some that allow illegals to receive some benefits.  If that‚Äôs the issue for you, Trump should push Congress to change those rules/ laws allowing that.  Right?  Why aren‚Äôt Trump/GOP doing that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrandsRising @HarijainD @realDonaldTrump I want solutions that‚Äôll work not a made up problem to rile the base and feed into their fears of immigrants.   Trump wants me to trust him blindly.  Not going to happen. Where‚Äôs the analysis; how will he pay for it ‚Äîtax increases or programs cut (which ones)?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrandsRising @HarijainD @realDonaldTrump So insulting me now?  Nice.  I‚Äôve offered nonpartisan sources for many comments. You talk about a case here and there as evidence of a huge problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrandsRising @HarijainD @realDonaldTrump We do know it‚Äôs a bigger problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrandsRising @HarijainD @realDonaldTrump Honestly I don‚Äôt care if the wall cost a dollar.  It‚Äôll be ineffectual because it doesn‚Äôt resolve underlying causes of the migration.     https://t.co/78CPwaISa3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrandsRising @HarijainD @realDonaldTrump At what cost? Again where‚Äôs the cost-benefit analysis of a wall and comparisons to other solutions, maybe less expensive and better?   A wall will not be a magic bullet; it doesn‚Äôt fix underlying causes for the migration from Central Am.  Should use facts not emotion.<|endoftext|>

According to the Homeland Security Department, about 500 immigrants were found to be not a ‚Äúlegitimate family unit‚Äù thus separated upon detention from April 19 to Sept. 30 of last year.

<|startoftext|>@GrandsRising @HarijainD @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs not just $5Billion.  It‚Äôll be more like $25 Billion plus millions in an maintenance cost.  Where‚Äôs the cost-benefit analysis?  Has there been other less expensive options considered? How to pay for it?  What programs cut? Will taxes increased? Or more debt?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrandsRising @HarijainD @realDonaldTrump So you don‚Äôt think they would find another way to enter like by hiding in car/truck through POE, by water, by plane, climbing over or tunneling under wall??

<|startoftext|>@TruthDG19 @FreeThinker420 @LynnePatton @funder You‚Äôre funny.  You seriously can‚Äôt identify the Rights distraction methods? Trump‚Äôs campaign was distraction &amp; propaganda!  ‚Äúbuild the wall‚Äù is a distraction from getting real immigration reform! Visa overstays exceed border crossings; most drug smuggling come in thru POE! Geez<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthDG19 @FreeThinker420 @LynnePatton @funder I‚Äôm surprised that you as a Trumper don‚Äôt like the ‚Äúdistraction‚Äù method?  Trump has made it an art form.  I would have thought you‚Äôd applaud the effort as ‚Äúnicely done‚Äù... no?  Not good for the ‚Äúgander‚Äù for Dems to do it?? Do you slam Trump and entourage when they do it too??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LynnePatton @funder @AniCorne ... Patton began working for Trump‚Äôs son Eric in 2009 as the vice president of his foundation and as his primary aide.

<|startoftext|>@LynnePatton @funder @AniCorne Nobody should care what you think ‚Äúevent planner‚Äù!   You‚Äôre obviously partisan.

<|startoftext|>@CorinneMichels @MarciaBorst3 @g_berish @charliekirk11 @BernieSanders ‚Äúsix states and DC get at least two times more electoral votes than they would under an equal-population system, while Texas and California each get 15 percent fewer electoral votes.‚Äù The electoral college is biased; more details please read this:   https://t.co/gKpCo6Al5W<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CorinneMichels @MarciaBorst3 @g_berish @charliekirk11 @BernieSanders Interesting you don‚Äôt want urban populations ‚Äúspeaking‚Äù for rural areas but ok for rural areas speaking for urban/more populated states?

<|startoftext|>@CorinneMichels @MarciaBorst3 @g_berish @charliekirk11 @BernieSanders Electoral College violates the principle of one-person, one-vote.

<|startoftext|>@Bunny_Slick @PastorDScott Thank you!  McConnell blocked similar legislation in 2016!!   Now Kushner and Trump are getting credit for supporting bipartisan legislation?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@manystylez910 @PastorDScott Well there is the history of this effort; it‚Äôs been going on for YEARS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@N6999tMeme @PastorDScott Not really; this has been a fight for years!   McConnell refused to allow vote in 2016 because of Trump campaigning on ‚Äúlaw &amp; order‚Äù   https://t.co/tpgCdkQZVK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dfwactivist @PastorDScott It was brought up under Obama, who supported it, McConnell refused to allow vote thanks to Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúlaw &amp; order‚Äù campaign message!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jimlundell @PastorDScott @realDonaldTrump This ‚Äúfight‚Äùhas been going on way before Trump!  Last effort in 2016 MCCONNELL wouldn‚Äôt allow a vote because of Trump‚Äôs‚Äùlaw &amp; order‚Äù campaign rhetoric!   So??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JosephMeliambro @PastorDScott @realDonaldTrump @donlemon @POTUS McConnell blocked the legislation in 2016 because of Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúlaw &amp; order‚Äù campaign rhetoric otherwise it would have passed in 2016!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PastorDScott @ali And... ‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs highlighted some of the crime surges we‚Äôve seen, and I do think it should require proponents of the federal legislation to re-evaluate their position,‚Äù said Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, referring to Mr. Trump.‚Äù<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PastorDScott @ali Why not 2016? ‚Äú...major factor given sharp disagreement among Senate Republicans reflected in the decision by Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, to not allow a vote on a proposal most believe would pass easily.   https://t.co/mmwdrTyS8k<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PastorDScott @ali So the truth is republicans blocked similar reforms in 2016!!    Attempts to pass more sweeping changes in Congress have failed, most notably during the 2016 presidential race, when criminal justice became a divisive issue. Trump campaigned on a ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù platform... -NBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosephMeliambro @PastorDScott @realDonaldTrump @donlemon @POTUS Well this effort has been going on for YEARS. Plus legislators efforts!  Bush and Obama both have sign legislation.

<|startoftext|>@PastorDScott @ali Bush and Obama??  ... in 2007 that provided grants to state and local government to help ex-prisoners return to society, and the other in 2010 that lowered sentences for the sale and possession of crack cocaine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PastorDScott @ali Trump deserves credit??    A yearslong slog to undo pieces of the federal government‚Äôs machinery of mass incarceration has turned into a sprint.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PastorDScott @ali Chuck Grassley of Iowa, a Rep,and Dick Durbin of Illinois, a Dem‚îÄ have been fighting for years for a more sweeping set of changes that, rather than focusing on people already in prison, would target the source of mass incarceration by reducing sentences for nonviolent offenders.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CarmeloMichael4 @SandySimpson100 @fionawoods46 @bluedgal @Acosta @PeterAlexander @WhiteHouse @POTUS I watched it live and just now to see if I missed something -nope.

<|startoftext|>@EmmatheBooBear @Samantha_Reader @capecodjaney @SenAmyKlobuchar @CBSThisMorning @SenFeinstein Emma,  you didn‚Äôt answer my question.   Could you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KWILL057 @capecodjaney @SenAmyKlobuchar @CBSThisMorning @YouTube @realDonaldTrump IMO there‚Äôs something fishy with his testimony. But maybe he‚Äôll be cleared now that Trump has FINALLY ordered BG check to be reopened. Don‚Äôt you wonder why it took so long? It would have been done by now if the Right hadn‚Äôt delayed. Don‚Äôt they want to know? NO, they don‚Äôt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robinta89909237 @scooterdawg @tastipes @clairecmc I recall watching some of the testimony in 1991 and really related to what Anita said.  I was going through my own sexual harassment at work and after I complained, I was conveniently laid off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KWILL057 @capecodjaney @SenAmyKlobuchar @CBSThisMorning @YouTube You just seem very involved in US politics.

<|startoftext|>@EmmatheBooBear @Samantha_Reader @capecodjaney @SenAmyKlobuchar @CBSThisMorning @SenFeinstein His testimony had concerns as well.  His responses were often lies especially about his yearbook and his attempt to discredit his college roommate was questionable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmmatheBooBear @Samantha_Reader @capecodjaney @SenAmyKlobuchar @CBSThisMorning @SenFeinstein My character concerns have nothing to do with his testimony, it was his reactions.  He is not emotionally suited for the job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KWILL057 @capecodjaney @SenAmyKlobuchar @CBSThisMorning @YouTube @realDonaldTrump His display yesterday at the hearing just his reactions, outbursts, unprofessional behavior, refusal to answer direct questions told me he was not emotionally suited for the job.  BTW I didn‚Äôt care for Gorsuch but I never thought he was unsuitable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KWILL057 @capecodjaney @SenAmyKlobuchar @CBSThisMorning @YouTube @realDonaldTrump I wasn‚Äôt initially against him but I became against him after reading his opinions and memo whether a sitting president could be indicted.

<|startoftext|>@KWILL057 @capecodjaney @SenAmyKlobuchar @CBSThisMorning @YouTube @realDonaldTrump Trump is a laughing stock; I‚Äôm not scared of Trump.

<|startoftext|>@EmmatheBooBear @Samantha_Reader @capecodjaney @SenAmyKlobuchar @CBSThisMorning @SenFeinstein A person of questionable character should NOT be confirmed.  Ask yourself, if the nominee was a democrat would you want the investigation?  Anyone who has been accused of SUCH ACTS should be investigated even if it to clear his name. Otherwise he‚Äôll always have this cloud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KWILL057 @capecodjaney @SenAmyKlobuchar @CBSThisMorning @YouTube @realDonaldTrump Booker told us, not as an accusation of wrongdoing.

<|startoftext|>@StefanMolyneux These republican men are all POS. They are too weak to question her so they hired a prosecutor to cross examine her punlicly in an attempt to impeach her, a victim.

<|startoftext|>@StefanMolyneux Push Grassley to subpoena Mark Judge to question him then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StefanMolyneux @FreeWhiteMale This effort is an attempt to impeach her (see explainer below).  Grassley is not even trying to learn the truth.     https://t.co/dviC5YGN1V<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StefanMolyneux @FreeWhiteMale What? This isn‚Äôt an investigation.   This is an examination.   Investigators do not ask witnesses, victims, perpetrators questions in a public forum. This is meant to discredit her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardNarzins1 @ChuckGrassley Then encourage the committee to request trump request FBI investigate.  If found to be credible they could turn over to local police to file charges, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardNarzins1 @ChuckGrassley FBI should reopen background check and interview these new ppl.  Maryland doesn‚Äôt have statue of limitations on felonies and they could be charged.  Motive for pushing this? NY POST is a conservative tabloid.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NWcarol28 @SenFeinstein I don‚Äôt agree with his statement but we both know politicians will be politicians.

<|startoftext|>@NWcarol28 @SenFeinstein I have family in LE who conducted background checks.  A background check is not a criminal investigation; it‚Äôs a background check.

<|startoftext|>@scm491 @SenateMajLdr Breitbart?  Not biased much.   Let‚Äôs just wait and see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scm491 @SenateMajLdr Not really an FBI investigation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scm491 @SenateMajLdr Lol.   I would want an investigation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scm491 @SenateMajLdr So no possiblity that the men are lying?  Hm.  Ok glad you‚Äôre not my mom, sister or friend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scm491 @SenateMajLdr I don‚Äôt know where you got that but I watched an interview with reporter and that‚Äôs not the way it went.   ..New Yorker reached out to Ramirez‚Äînot the other way around.  ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt come forward with it,‚Äù Mayer said Monday    https://t.co/BkRwDNg5XW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump So you‚Äôre now buying into the ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù conspiracy theory?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scm491 @SenateMajLdr BTW I‚Äôm sure you know there are two more women.  Guess they are lying too?  But not the men (friends if Kav) lying as some kind of good ol‚Äô boys -locker room pack to cover up O‚ÄôKavanaugh‚Äôs actions?  Maybe?  Just women wanting to destroy a MAN‚Äôs reputation - how dare she!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PalmerReport Sad if this is true.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@golferdawn @MontyBoa99 @waltshaub @peterbakernyt Yeah it seems extremely odd to me. And especially if we are speaking in a legal sense to demonstrate his innocence.  Calendars that could not include everything and could be fabricated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scm491 @SenateMajLdr And if he didn‚Äôt do it then how is this ‚Äúdestroying‚Äù his life?  Doesn‚Äôt sound like you have much confidence that he didn‚Äôt do it.  If anything she‚Äôs the one going to be destroyed; already has in some respects.  She‚Äôll be forever associated with this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scm491 @SenateMajLdr She is testifying.  It‚Äôs stupid to believe she‚Äôs doing this as part of a political agenda.  If you have some proof of that plz share. Otherwise you‚Äôre just victim blaming.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jimkiefer1952 This photo looks like it‚Äôs from the 60‚Äôs, not 80‚Äôs!  But it‚Äôs nice (sarcasm) to know the Right is not above victim blaming and smearing the victim‚Äôs character.  #Pathetic  you should delete this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scm491 @SenateMajLdr Studies show that it‚Äôs unlikely she‚Äôs lying.  Also Judge Kavanaugh apparently liked his clerks to look a certain way and many were described as looking like models.  That‚Äôs objectification of women.  That‚Äôs not the kind of person I want as a SC Justice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scm491 @SenateMajLdr The GOP is also making her look guilty of lying in the eyes of the public but why would she want to destroy her life (she‚Äôs had death threats, had to leave home).  She could have remained silent. Don‚Äôt blame Ford for Feinstein‚Äôs poor judgment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BodegaDawg @steph93065 @aohughes @MsVeruca @sailorstout I agree. I find it amazing how ppl (women in particular) are quick to believe she is lying when they know neither personally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steph93065 @aohughes @MsVeruca @sailorstout Regardless we know his position based on Garza v Hargan.   Plus Trump committed to appoint judge who would immediately overturn Roe. Not to mention his other opinions.  He‚Äôs not a moderate.  God Bless!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steph93065 @aohughes @MsVeruca @sailorstout Per Washington Examiner:    ‚ÄúWhen Kavanaugh referred to the pill‚Äôs abortifacient nature, he was speaking of the science of contraception, not the politics.‚Äù<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>People forget about the victim in all of this.     https://t.co/kJlnR4fc7l<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lmtuel @Machovell1an @AndreaWinters @womensmarch @maziehirono Of course. He should be removed and I have communicated that to my representative.   I thought Bill Clinton should have resigned.  We need to raise the bar, not lower it!  You didn‚Äôt answer my question tho - do you think Moore‚Äôs and Trump‚Äôs accusers are all liars?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lmtuel @Machovell1an @AndreaWinters @womensmarch @maziehirono And in Maryland she wasn‚Äôt old enough to consent.  He was sooo at least legally he was a MAN.    Individuals aged 15 or younger in Maryland are not legally able to consent to sexual activity, and such activity may result in prosecution for statutory rape.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lmtuel @Machovell1an @AndreaWinters @womensmarch @maziehirono In fact studies have stated false accusations are rare.   Do you think all of Roy Moore‚Äôs and Trump‚Äôs accusers were liars too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lmtuel @Machovell1an @AndreaWinters @womensmarch @maziehirono So sad women pass this kind of judgment on other women when based on how you feel about the accused.  It‚Äôs called ‚Äúhalo effect‚Äù.  In fact it‚Äôs very common that details are forgotten. There were witnesses but they don‚Äôt want to be involved bc of public backlash like yours!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SaraCarterDC I wish they would make demands on Kavanaugh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bear42J @RBReich Lol!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Completely true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rogerthatone @Machovell1an @AndreaWinters @womensmarch @maziehirono Accused of 3 rapes; 16 women have come forward to accuse him of inappropriate actions against them.  They all can‚Äôt be lying and they all can‚Äôt be some dem conspiracy.  Glad I‚Äôm not your wife or daughter, you‚Äôd defend my rapist.      https://t.co/HKQuzc0v2Z<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rogerthatone @Machovell1an @AndreaWinters @womensmarch @maziehirono trump has done plenty against women. Where have you‚Äôve been?  He‚Äôs even named as a rapist against 13 yr old girl; accused of groping numerous women; walking in on teen beauty candidates. That‚Äôs not actions? you defend HIM?  You ok him doing those things with ur daughter? F‚Äôd Up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rogerthatone @Machovell1an @AndreaWinters @womensmarch @maziehirono No you‚Äôre wrong there.  Trump has been squawking about investigating Hillary numerous times.  I‚Äôm good with it; investigate her AGAIN.      https://t.co/pBkSe33KFo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rogerthatone @Machovell1an @AndreaWinters @womensmarch @maziehirono Actually on the president, the FF set up electoral college to safeguard against a tyrant manipulating public opinion and come to power. The FF were afraid of direct election to the Presidency.  So EC should have rejected Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rogerthatone @Machovell1an @AndreaWinters @womensmarch @maziehirono Hm...it is the way it is because of who the people voted in, which is exactly as the FF wanted it. It‚Äôs not the politicians fault; It‚Äôs the voting public‚Äôs fault. More swamp and corruption since Trump has been in office.  Vote for better candidates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rogerthatone @Machovell1an @AndreaWinters @womensmarch @maziehirono So using your standard, you think Melania defense of Trump was worse than Trump‚Äôs comments (who is a known sexual predator)?   https://t.co/RUXmx7gCDI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rogerthatone @Machovell1an @AndreaWinters @womensmarch @maziehirono That FBI comment is untrue. Regarding Hillary she lost, so unlike the fake ‚Äúmoral majority‚Äù who DID vote for a flawed candidate, the dems rejected Hillary.  And the dems don‚Äôt run on morality!  Better question, why didn‚Äôt the Right reject Trump?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All the times Trump was accused of wrong maybe illegal acts against women.  He should have been disqualified by GOP as a candidate.  https://t.co/sQiRlVSZGb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rogerthatone @Machovell1an @AndreaWinters @womensmarch @maziehirono And Trump!  Look at the list below.  You think a wife defending her husband is worse than a man actually doing the inappropriate &amp; probable illegal acts? Yikes... there lies the problem; women don‚Äôt matter.  Wow.   https://t.co/sQiRlVSZGb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rogerthatone @Machovell1an @AndreaWinters @womensmarch @maziehirono I didn‚Äôt support Clinton &amp; Bill should have resigned. But since when do we hold family members to the same standard as the perp? Family often don‚Äôt testify in court against relative; too biased. Interesting you are holding HRC to a higher standard than Kav.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rogerthatone @Machovell1an @AndreaWinters @womensmarch @maziehirono GOP has issues. not saying dems don‚Äôt but they aren‚Äôt in control &amp; aren‚Äôt setting policies or senate/house procedures. Boy if GOP loses control, they are screwed thanks to McConnell; Dem  Majority Ldr will keep his rules and give GOP the finger! Stupid!   https://t.co/ka5pr3gmFn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rogerthatone @Machovell1an @AndreaWinters @womensmarch @maziehirono Truth is truth regardless of when it is disclosed. Like Repubs, I‚Äôm sure political timing has to do with it. Don‚Äôt act like the GOP wouldn‚Äôt do the same if available... GOP just hasn‚Äôt had the opportunity (more morally flawed candidates on the right lately - ur list).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rogerthatone @Machovell1an @AndreaWinters @womensmarch @maziehirono If in an investigative interview, those present at the time may open up and talk to Agents. Who wants to be subjected to the public and media?  Of course they‚Äôll want to avoid that.  Look at your attitude; you‚Äôve already made ur decision. You don‚Äôt think they considered that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rogerthatone @Machovell1an @AndreaWinters @womensmarch @maziehirono I have expressed my concerns to my rep but I don‚Äôt live in Minn. Voters voted for a flawed natl candidate who is a serial sexual predator &amp; misogynist-TRUMP.  GOP could have not supported him but they did. His behavior should have disqualified him - but you don‚Äôt care do you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rogerthatone @Machovell1an @AndreaWinters @womensmarch @maziehirono And stop the speculation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rogerthatone @Machovell1an @AndreaWinters @womensmarch @maziehirono As stated in the article, FBI would investigate if Trump requested - why doesn‚Äôt he?  The investigation wouldn‚Äôt be criminal; that is up to local LE/DA to press charges.  Instead of debating here why not push investigation to learn the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rogerthatone @Machovell1an @AndreaWinters @womensmarch @maziehirono Regarding Ellison, if up to me he would not get any support from dems and the party would demand he not run, but like Trump, the voters will decide, right?  But unlike kavanaugh the voters don‚Äôt decide directly; only through representatives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rogerthatone @Machovell1an @AndreaWinters @womensmarch @maziehirono Wrong.  They have, they can, it should be demanded.  Trump just has to ask for it.   Better question is why doesn‚Äôt he?  Why wouldn‚Äôt he and GOP want to clear Kavanaugh before confirm?  That‚Äôs the question.  https://t.co/xEb85MvMjU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rogerthatone @Machovell1an @AndreaWinters @womensmarch @maziehirono Yeah you do that‚Äôs why you should also demand an investigation and not let GOP off the hook.  Kav will have cloud over his appointment otherwise. But statistically, few have made false accusations. So if he did do it, more reason to investigate. Unless ur afraid of the truth?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fkatriggerman @Franatic1 @GovMikeHuckabee @JeffFlake I truly hope you will never have a family member who has been sexually assaulted. I don‚Äôt want anyone to feel that lifelong torment.      https://t.co/1RjLRpRY9d<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fkatriggerman @Franatic1 @GovMikeHuckabee @JeffFlake Statistics show that very few accusers are lying. That‚Äôs a shame you think she is. I‚Äôm not defending Feinstein. But to assume Ford is lying and not have any doubt about kavanaugh is truly disappointing.   At least push for FBI investigation.  Get the truth before judging.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dakota295752 @melissan724 @Franatic1 @GovMikeHuckabee @JeffFlake No. I am reserving my opinion on whethr she is lying or he is guilty.   I want an investigation. How‚Äôvr I do think we, as a society, should treat victims with respect - let‚Äôs not send death threats or immediately decide SHE is lying bc her claim is against ur favorite nominee.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissan724 @dakota295752 @Franatic1 @GovMikeHuckabee @JeffFlake Exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Machovell1an @AndreaWinters @womensmarch @maziehirono You are also indicating the accusation is not true.   If it‚Äôs true then what?   Still feel that way?  Men can go assault ppl without ANY consequences?   How convenient life is for you (perpetrator)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dakota295752 @melissan724 @Franatic1 @GovMikeHuckabee @JeffFlake I disagree that a 15 yr old possesses the maturity to make the adult decision about sex and the consequences of that decision UNLIKE an ADULT man who is pushing her to do it.

<|startoftext|>@dakota295752 @melissan724 @Franatic1 @GovMikeHuckabee @JeffFlake My understanding basically states view minors as incapable of consenting (age differs depending on state).

<|startoftext|>@KevinMetz5 @my15kids @emzorbit @julievzwilson @nycsouthpaw No it‚Äôs about policy, but I do have an issue with the morality hypocrisy of the right.

<|startoftext|>@uberman2018 @BillOReilly  https://t.co/NuMP3qzt6X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uberman2018 @BillOReilly To be clear, Norway has high tax rate on their petroleum industry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bertieb35 @uberman2018 @BillOReilly Capitalism supports free movement of labor/ open borders. Protectionism is a socialist principle. On this issue, you‚Äôd think the right (free mkt supporters) would support open borders and left would support closed to protect workers. (Bernie and Trump agree on this, right?)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uberman2018 @BillOReilly Lol... Norway‚Äôs personal income tax is 25.4%.  US is higher.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bertieb35 @uberman2018 @BillOReilly But that second part isn‚Äôt happening much from what I have read.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uberman2018 @BillOReilly I have also been unemployed, but there were some jobs that paid too little, were too far away, hours didn‚Äôt work (kids), or no benefits.  So rather than job hop, I turn down those job offers.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@uberman2018 @BillOReilly The right also like to use Venezuela as an example of socialism, but it is really more if a dictatorship now.  Another country with large oil production  is Norway, which is blowing the US out the door by the metrics:   https://t.co/Mx94ZKys9O<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@uberman2018 @BillOReilly I haven't decided on increasing minimum wage. Eventually automation will take most low paying jobs.  The bigger problem is preparing a workforce without these jobs that is through training and education for what jobs there will be.   https://t.co/eAmcFxW2yB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/zxRMWuFXFQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uberman2018 @BillOReilly Why is the right forgetting about the great recession Obama had to deal with immediately? Congress passed the legislation.

<|startoftext|>@WalshFreedom Really?  What?  I know of the Tea Party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoreyStewartVA @realDonaldTrump Yeah, because there was an effing economic recession going on... the worst since the great depression!   At least there was good reason.  You on the other hand gave billions to the 1% and F the workers!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@420RCtrx4 @Captain37176361 @WalterLapp @Smith3Barbarah @Deeraflynn @RandPaul It's in the article I posted too.  Which means they are likely to start seeking less expensive/more favorable trade to them... under Trump that's not the US.

<|startoftext|>@420RCtrx4 @Captain37176361 @WalterLapp @Smith3Barbarah @Deeraflynn @RandPaul You mean the mkt recovery under obama that Trump benefited from?  I would rather look at quality of life for all, not just big corps/wealthiest.  We have a lot of homelessness and nearly half the population struggles to pay for necessities... that's not a sign all is good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@420RCtrx4 @Captain37176361 @WalterLapp @Smith3Barbarah @Deeraflynn @RandPaul Sorry, but the damage could be severe to US farmers, if China expands relationship with south America countries.  They already buy soy from Brazil.  Once those supply chains are developed they won't come back to US.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@420RCtrx4 @Captain37176361 @WalterLapp @Smith3Barbarah @Deeraflynn @RandPaul She's not pres so let's stick with reality and who is; judge Trump on his policies and results &amp; not these "he's better than" guesses. I read some economists think the market is on a sugar high thanks to the huge tax breaks, but poor trade policy may put a hamper on it all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@420RCtrx4 @Captain37176361 @WalterLapp @Smith3Barbarah @Deeraflynn @RandPaul On top of the $15 billion already set aside for farmers... What happened to the free market conservatives?  Now market interventionists.     https://t.co/2MvJOh216D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@420RCtrx4 @Captain37176361 @WalterLapp @Smith3Barbarah @Deeraflynn @RandPaul So you agree that Trump's trade policies are not free market and he should not give aid to businesses to offset the effects of his trade war?  It is an abuse of power and Congress is complicit.  And it's not a small amount ... at least $12 Billion<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KWILL057 @therealroseanne ??? Right.  She got ostracized by all... she's a liberal.  Few supported her "joke"..  even her buddy Cooper distanced himself from her.  So yeah, liberal comedians have been treated harshly for their poor actions.  That's my point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Captain37176361 @WalterLapp @420RCtrx4 @Smith3Barbarah @Deeraflynn @RandPaul I don't understand how the right doesn't see the tax cut to billionaires as cronyism.

<|startoftext|>@uberman2018 @BillOReilly How does that excuse Trump's corruption?  pace of expansion is expected to cool from the 2nd quarter as the tax-cut boost fades, a trade war threatens business demand and the Fed raises interest rates further. Economists surveyed ... project a 2.9% expansion for the full year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@420RCtrx4 @WalterLapp @Smith3Barbarah @Deeraflynn @RandPaul Besides the US government doesn't really own the gold reserve.  The fed does.  The treasury holds the gold but the fed has the gold certificates that are backed by physical gold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@420RCtrx4 @WalterLapp @Smith3Barbarah @Deeraflynn @RandPaul Not a good idea.  We need the gold reserves as collateral.  Besides without fixing structural issues, we would  be in debt again and have little for collateral... dumb.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Cedarflame @vickielshack @Sammyt108 @realDonaldTrump Let's face it, Trump does mock people, name call, and often lies (alternate facts... truth isn't truth?) üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vickielshack @Cedarflame @Sammyt108 @realDonaldTrump We also need to compromise more.  Not sure when that became a bad word.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vickielshack @Cedarflame @Sammyt108 @realDonaldTrump Well at the risk of sounding "judgey" you may want to refrain from using "lies from the left".   That'll quickly shut down a real, open discussion.... just like "lies from the Right" would.  I think there's a lot of different perspective and values going on.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@vickielshack @Cedarflame @Sammyt108 @realDonaldTrump Good for you.  Just curious at the end of those discussions do you go away thinking you've made your point/they support your position/ changed their mind, or do you change your mind or do all agree to disagree?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vickielshack @Cedarflame @Sammyt108 @realDonaldTrump Then tell me what makes dems a cult and who is the said leader of cult?  It's not Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer.

<|startoftext|>@vickielshack @Cedarflame @Sammyt108 @realDonaldTrump Not a competition but I was doing better financially before Trump so unhappy about that.

<|startoftext|>@poisonedpoet @redsnoopystock @CsStalks @realDonaldTrump That's completely untrue.  In the general election, Lincoln again faced Douglas, who represented the northern Democrats; southern Democrats had nominated John C.

<|startoftext|>@Nick_Creeps @morton_drew @danielgrippaudo @CsStalks @realDonaldTrump Ok.  The point is these white supremacists feel comfortable enough to run under GOP name.

<|startoftext|>@Tdawg80 @deadPeanut @MidniteRavyn @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump üòÇ  feel free!   The argument that I needed to have been equally upset at Obama to make my upset at Trump valid is a stupid argument.

<|startoftext|>@Tdawg80 @deadPeanut @MidniteRavyn @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Point.  You can't support your claim so you degrade to insults.  #DumbingDown #Idiocracy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NavyAviationFan @Will12074 @deadPeanut @MidniteRavyn @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump What?  That doesn't even make sense.    Asylum seekers must be here physically in US to apply.  It doesn't matter if they arrived at POE or walked a crossed the border.  That's the point.  They have due process rights under our CONSTITUTION.

<|startoftext|>@MidniteRavyn @REALFLIPOR @Jennifer44040 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump So you don't vote?    PS...stop demonizing the dems.  And if feel you must, then demonize the Republicans too.  Otherwise you're a hypocrite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MidniteRavyn @REALFLIPOR @Jennifer44040 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump You're the one who needed to make it a point that you left because of the hate.  If you didn't want a response or wasn't prepared to defend then don't make the statement.  Duh...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MidniteRavyn @REALFLIPOR @Jennifer44040 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump "Nice try"??  What does that mean?  So you don't want to hear that your reason is illogical.    Enjoy.    Good luck fighting for civil rights on your own.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@REALFLIPOR @MidniteRavyn @Jennifer44040 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Simply put:  there is no moral equivalency between antifa and white supremacists.      I don't ever condone violence but there is no way in hell I'll side with a party that tolerates racists.    I suggest you read the history on antifa. BC it doesn't sound like you understand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MidniteRavyn @REALFLIPOR @Jennifer44040 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump The Dems are inciting riots?  When?  Are you referring to the black bloc and antifa?   Ok if you are going to blame an entire party for the behavior of a the outliers then you aren't a republican then either, correct ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MidniteRavyn @REALFLIPOR @Jennifer44040 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump "hate" reason is weak.  Dems are criticized for being too PC &amp; are "snowflakes"; now they are "hateful".   You select a party based its platform &amp; how it aligns w/ur values. Ex... It makes no sense to be a dem if you support tax cuts for rich and deregulation of enviro laws.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@retirednavy05 @BillFeuchter @WalshFreedom I mistated.  There's 7700 missing but NoKo says they have 200...  "North Korean officials have indicated in the past that they have the remains of as many as 200 U.S. troops."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DorothyERoberts Honestly, I don't think some, (most?) Care.  The attitude I have seen expressed most often is blaming the woman, under few to no circumstances she should seek abortion, if she does she should face criminal charges.  The man is never viewed as a contributing party.  Her fault.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Uselessrant @buddynewman @conservmillen @ReaganBattalion Yes.  So many ppl slut shame the women failing to acknowledge she didn't get pregnant by herself!  Men are half of the problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@buddynewman @conservmillen @ReaganBattalion Exactly.  We have real world situations to draw from, and from our own history.  Where contraceptives are easy to obtain, abortions decline.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@C_12Todd @RepBrianHiggins @NancyPelosi Sorry that's bulls*t.  Try hiring an attorney to represent you on pay, benefits, etc. to go against the cadry of corporate attorneys.  I did try once.  They had already hired all labor attorneys in my area.  Couldn't represent me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ToddShissler @RepBrianHiggins Because you reap the benefits.  Unions represent a job class, all in the class receive the benefit.   I hope unions will be able to carve out those who pay and only represent them. You don't pay, you don't get benefits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CatharineSquare @RepBrianHiggins @NancyPelosi Then will you reject the good pay, benefits, working conditions?  You want to reap the perks but not pay for the representation?   This decision erodes unions in time it'll erode workers rights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepBrianHiggins @NancyPelosi The working folks who are anti-union don't know history.

PP v Casey - SCOTUS: ‚ÄúIt is a promise of the Constition that there is a realm of personal liberty which the govt may not enter.‚Äù In¬†Casey, SCOTUS was asked for the sixth time in a decade to overturn¬†Roe, and the Court essentially said "no".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Philmikki @3MarieJustine3 @TomiLahren SCOTUS decided on legalities, not me.  Currently it is based on 5th &amp; 14th Amend with permissible states' restricns (up to viability). To chg it, Congress must act.  Apparently you don't know that is the way our system works.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@darekB52 @Philmikki @3MarieJustine3 @TomiLahren My article is in response to your human trafficking video and the photo of the little girl.

<|startoftext|>@Philmikki @3MarieJustine3 @TomiLahren I only "blame" you if you support this separation policy.   To be clear, I support immigration reform.  I don't support the US committing human rights violations.   There's got to be a better way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Philmikki @3MarieJustine3 @TomiLahren You have no idea how desperate these parents are.  You have no idea how bad the situations are they are trying to escape.

<|startoftext|>@Philmikki @3MarieJustine3 @TomiLahren And, I believe that the current interpretation of the 2nd Amend is wrong.   But neither one (abortion, gun rights) has anything to do with trumps policy of separating kids from parents especially those seeking asylum.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rhonda_harbison @kimguilfoyle @DonaldJTrumpJr And now with the GOP tax scam, we'll have a huge tax bill in ten years but I read the effects will start in 2020.  High inflation, major cuts or increase in taxes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Angry1American @businessinsider Well the problem is renegotiating trade deals is sensitive.

<|startoftext|>@Bturturro @ABC This is becoming circular.  I respectfully disagree.  I see it as a peaceful protest. Some military also don't see it as an affront to them.

<|startoftext|>@moments_tender @Timbuck6 @RealJamesWoods @NancyPelosi @JerryBrownGov Honestly, some would say it's an income inequality problem as well.  They can't afford housing.

<|startoftext|>@snotphobic @moments_tender Jerry, I think for some homeless, you are right.  Others prefer to be homeless (don't want rules).

<|startoftext|>@Richranting @CalliCoop @ACLU It is now.    5 children were deported, 28 ran away, and 52 ... relocated with a nonsponsor. But officials were unable to determine what happened with the remaining 1,475 children .. raising fears that the kids are victims of human traffickers or laborers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Richranting @CalliCoop @ACLU Wow, Rich.   You sure did a 180 on this topic.  Ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haberm1Bell @Richranting @CalliCoop @ACLU Steven Wagner testified about this...   https://t.co/41kgLcnmsp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Richranting @Haberm1Bell @CalliCoop @ACLU these children were "lost" after.  Hopefully they are all fine but they don't know.  Oh I'm sure any children being "lost" prior to shelters were likely victims of human trafficking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Richranting @Haberm1Bell @CalliCoop @ACLU The point is the US government under Trump and condoned by Sessions lost track of these children.  Some were taken from their parents and now could be in harm. That's the problem.  Instead of pointing fingers; trump needs to fix it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haberm1Bell @Richranting @CalliCoop @ACLU Some were just kids crossing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Richranting @Haberm1Bell @CalliCoop @ACLU Makes sense, right?  The pro- immigrant, DACA signing President, directed ICE to tear families apart.  But, not anti-immigration, Hispanic hating Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haberm1Bell @Richranting @CalliCoop @ACLU Beg to differ:  "Under Trump directives, the children of families that are separated are placed under custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement and then placed in government shelters."   https://t.co/Nc1GIyhHyx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haberm1Bell @Richranting @CalliCoop @ACLU Ditto.   Besides Trump is president now.  He owns the nation's problems ... real, fabricated, and those he brought on himself (Stormy, et al, Donald Jr Russia meeting)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haberm1Bell @CalliCoop @ACLU Liberty Bell, you obviously didn't read the article. Regardless, if you dislike ACLU so much then why are you following them or commenting?  Surely the Christian thing is to move on.  Matthew 5:39.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haberm1Bell @CalliCoop @ACLU Liberty Bell, just curious, have you ever actually gone into a PP clinic for care?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Democracy depends upon a certain idea of truth: ... This must be a goal; it can never fully be achieved. Authoritarianism arises when this goal is openly abandoned, and people conflate the truth with what they want to hear.  https://t.co/DyRv8PXefd<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Nickarama1 @_stryker1 @DavidCIHCSP @truthtalk4once @IvankaTrump Still wrong.  We should do everything possible to keep families together. .. wouldn't that be the Christian thing to do?  I can't believe Jesus would approve.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TeeMill1 @Chris_Summers_ How quickly they forget that their  president George W. got us into an economic disaster.  W inherited a surlus from Bill Clinton.  Yet, Obama was the bad pres.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cottinghamcarl @PolitiFact @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Yeah, he's a hypocrite.  He criticized Obama for golfing and basically said he wasn't working.   That's the point.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Juniorevitch @thehill Hm...neither being the president nor being a billionaire doesn't make him right or make him above constructive criticism.    You think it does?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@debbiedonothing @raymondtberle @joanwalsh @NoraWD @realDonaldTrump @Iowa Exactly.  I don't always agree with the left but at least they aren't oppressing my rights or trying to oppress me /others.  The right pushes their interpretation of Christian morality and makes laws to support that.   No thanks GOP!<|endoftext|>
