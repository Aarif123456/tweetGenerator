<|startoftext|>@AngrierWHStaff The Dems need to take a lesson from the GOP playbook and close ranks right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ilovefenchfrys @AngrierWHStaff There’s also the legit need to work. Thats why a lockdown has to come with stimulus relied. And a President who doesn’t make masks a political statement.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AngrierWHStaff Yes! I have a doctorate in public health. A lockdown is essential to control the current spread. It’s how New Zealand handled it, and got back to normal life sooner The Trump administration missed the boat on national leadership to control the pandemic. It’ll be much harder now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sonali_Dev Mine is too. For four years I’ve been wondering what Russian generated blackmail Trump has on McConnell.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Pence is appealing to the uninformed. Harris did not say they are raising taxes for the working class. They are going to get rid of loopholes that let people like trump pay $750 or no taxes.   #Imspeaking #VPDebate2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Something to look forward to…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤣🤣🤣🤣 How many of you can relate to this?  https://t.co/MHUf7iNQtR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@courtneymilan Daily? I can barely manage weekly.  https://t.co/0xvYunVUtf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, I do this with books I love. #amreading<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mostlybree That looks beautiful. Can’t wait to buy!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@preslaysawrites YES!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@preslaysawrites Don’t get me started about that book. I’m still mad I wasted my time reading it. I don’t tear down other authors, otherwise I would use it as an example of how not to write diverse romance. Felt like the author orig wrote a white heroine and then made her black to sell more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>⁦@CNN⁩ it’s not the allies who are in despair. It’s us. The allies have strong leaders and will come out of this. We are the ones who are screwed by being left out of the world response.   Allies despair as Trump abandons America’s leadership role  https://t.co/UQeX5cKDgr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kmckharris 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 wishing you more success like this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@preslaysawrites I can’t even. I recently read a book by a best-selling author, where the secretary heroine was black, and in love with a rich white boss. The book was suggested to me as an example of diverse writing. 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LinasMusings I can’t unsee this now.  https://t.co/B269MisUuy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tuphlos Why does it matter that she’s adopted? The only focus should be on how happy she is, and how her beautiful makes us happy when we look at it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m excited about the fact that Netflix has Indian shows. Thats a win. Could it be better? YES! Should we support it. YES! Because that’s how we will get better shows. End of rant. Thanks for listening. 🙏🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>10) @mindykaling is almost the same age that I am. Perhaps that’s why I can relate to the show. Millennials had a very different experience than us Gen X’ers. It wasn’t cool to be Indian when I went to high school. Henna was not popular. Yoga wasn’t a thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>9)Could the show have done a better job of showing the positive aspects of the Indian community? YES! When I lived in Mumbai, our apartment building celebrated all the religious holidays. I participated in Eid, Christmas, Diwali....My India is very respectful of other religions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>8)Did they portray the judgemental attitude of Indian aunties correctly? YES! I couldn’t go to a New Year’s party in highschool, because my father was sick, and it would look wrong for me to party, while he had been in a coma for 6+ months. No consideration of my  mental health.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>7)While I respect desis who might not like the negative portrayal of our culture in the show, I relate to Devi. Was the wheechair bit offensive? YES! Was the portrayal of divorce due to religion wrong! YES!! Were the accents overblown? YES!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>6)Watching my family’s racism led me to question their beliefs, because they didn’t correlate to my own experiences. It led me to understand the root causes of hate, and the awful consequences of perpetuating it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5)Would I have done as well in school if my parents hadn’t put academic pressure on me? Probably not. And had I not been financially independent, I wouldn’t have had the courage to divorce. What we sometimes consider a negative of our cultural upbringing can also be a positive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4)Despite growing up in an environment that fostered hate and suppression, I’m stopping the cycle. I was the first in my family to get divorced from the suitable Indian boy who didn’t share my beliefs, and was emotionally abusive. I didn’t want my children growing up that way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3) Just like there are upper class Trump supporters, there are Modi supporters. My parents grew up hearing stories of the India/Pakistan partition. My grandparents lived it. Atrocities on both sides have created deep-seated hate that is hard for older generations to overcome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2) when I got caught with a hickey, it was worse for my parents that my boyfriend was Muslim than the fact that I had a boyfriend. I was 15. Islamaphobia is real in Indian communities and we are seeing the horrific consequences in India right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1) my parents were restrictive and controlling. It was the age before cell phones, and boys couldn’t call my house. My boyfriend would have his sisters ask for me. And I would anxiously listen for the sound of someone picking up an additional receiver in the house<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This may be a controversial view for those who hate #NeverHaveIEver but every immigrant experience is different. I’m a young Gen X’er. I was 12 when I moved to Canada from India. The show is not perfect, but it does illuminate some ugly truths that I relate to.  /thread/<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@angelajames I’m mostly traditionally published and have benefited greatly from my editors.
