<|startoftext|>@mtgreenee @IlhanMN @mtgreenee @IlhanMN you both are making women look bad. You were voted to be house reps by your constituents to get shit done for them. You’re perpetuating further division in our country by not working together. We are done with the name calling BS. Get some shit done.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Disciple_Love @HagemeyerLinda @nytimes I like this, well stated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>via ⁦@nytimes⁩  the hypocrisy is not surprising.   Basically November is going to be the cherry on the dumpster fire that is 2020.   Guess I better stock up on supplies now.    https://t.co/8qGmHb7FAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shannonrwatts Heard about this &amp; immediately guessed it was a group of mid-thirties to fifty year old white men. Why aren’t they being called terrorists? I thought plotting to kidnap and potentially kill a government employee would be deemed an act of terrorism?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Can his team please educate him before he says things? Regeneron is a company, not the drug cocktail they gave him.   And how is he going to get ~328.2 million people vaccinated for ‘free’? Force private companies? How is that not ‘big government’? Or our tax $? Also not ‘free’.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZKERGAYE @IlhanMN @VP Wow, they weren’t sure what to say to that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vvgomez @TheDailyShow What movie/show is this from?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeanniology @CarmineSabia @LadyofFe How is this relevant to her being potentially the VP? How is ‘the ability to be a friend’ a required skill for helping run the country? Anyway, she slayed him.<|endoftext|>
