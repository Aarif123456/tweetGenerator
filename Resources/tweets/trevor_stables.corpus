<|startoftext|>Hospital Death rates are twice as high as France. Why ? Because in France everyone who needed a Hospital bed got one - with available oxygen.

<|startoftext|>@LibDemsLiz Nope. I have been a member for 36 years. We still are the Party of Kennedy and Ashdown.  We have just had à Democratic vote, every member got à vote.

<|startoftext|>@Cayden_Stoeger ONS for week of April 4th said Community deaths were plus 52% on top of stats for Hospital Deaths for that week.

<|startoftext|>@JCHannah77 Jon. It strike me that Registrars of Deaths in each local authority area. Could assemble death rates including Community and Care Homes very quickly.  Primary and secondary causes of deaths recorded  It is computerised and on paper.  . @munirawilson.. @EdwardJDavey. @LaylaMoran<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bradontour2 @DHSCgovuk @CMO_England @CMOWales @publichealthni @PHE_uk @PublicHealthW @scotgovhealth @NHSEngland France includes Deaths in Hospitals and Community. Not difficult. Registrar of Deaths in each local Council could do this in 2 hours each week.  Italy tests post mortem all deaths in Community. UK does not.  Suspicion is that Government covering up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bradontour2 @DHSCgovuk @CMO_England @CMOWales @publichealthni @PHE_uk @PublicHealthW @scotgovhealth @NHSEngland Actually it showed 4. 8% of all non hospital deaths in that week were due to Coronavirus. 500 deaths in 1 week.  This correlates with other Countries. These have still NOT been added to the Total.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BillyNellisV2 @Timeflies1980 @elohleahcim @piersmorgan @BorisJohnson I'm in France. It has. France is taking it much more seriously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @BorisJohnson More People died of The Spanish flu in 1918 than died in WW1 think of that! This is what a virus can do.   Johnson must act, too much time has been lost already.  #ProtectTheVulnerable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @BorisJohnson I'm not your no1 fan Piers but on this you are totally right. It's a disgrace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Incredulous at the complacency of many Brits in the face of #coronavirus  Johnson has transferred his complacent lighthearted silly attitude to far too many people. #ProtectTheVulnerable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdwardJDavey @lewiscoughlan I have no confidence in UK Chief MO who has not shut Schools nor public places. It is an apalling decision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sandbach @lewiscoughlan Johnson has wasted 2 weeks.  The vulnerable, people with existing conditions and Elderly will pay the price. Schools and all public places Should be closed immediately as they are in France.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timfarron @lewiscoughlan It seems that UK Government is deliberately following the Herd Immunity Strategy contrary to WHO Protocols. Mad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timfarron @lewiscoughlan 600 miles away in France but hearing of people in UK who are family members of friends in London and Yorkshire who are showing signs of being infected. This is bordering on being out of control, Public places like pubs/ schools Should shut Immediately. #ProtectTheVulnerable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timfarron @lewiscoughlan Tim, hope very much thay you all keep well.  I was a Nurse for 30 years &amp; worked in Infection Control. Frankly apalled that UK Government have not followed strict measures implemented in France.  Schools should have been shut a week ago, Testing protocol and contact tracing 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@apoplexyUK @LaylaMoran Governments Must act to protect the Vulnerable. Remember that this affects everyone.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@UKinFrance @EmmanuelMacron @AdeMontchalin @FCOtravel UK then better pdq start implementing the same necessary measures as France. Testing in the Community and not just in Hospitals. Dismayed to hear on British TV that diagnosis of several cases only made post mortem.  British Government far too complacent, rejecting WHO guidelines<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdeMontchalin @EmmanuelMacron Bonjour, si le R-U ne cloture pas les ecoles, ni faire le meme choses pour reduir les contaminations que la France ce'st absolument necessaire a changer cette avis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jburnmurdoch @MeirickChris Testing! Test, test, test!  Without it Hospitals themselves will be source of infection for other patients. Disturbed to hear that Hospitalised Patients in UK being diagnosed only post-mortem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carolecadwalla @imperialcollege The graph in terms of time line seems totally over optimistic. The Country has no idea whatsoever of prevalence due to absence of testing. Visitors to Hospitals and Care Homes not restricted. Timescale is now not in 4 weeks time.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@carolecadwalla Apalling complacency. Is Govt Policy driven by Economic savings rather than Health Protection?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElizAthertonSop @wafu23RN @LFC_Ace @mikegalsworthy @Peston  https://t.co/JeOxNb4jfj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElizAthertonSop @wafu23RN @LFC_Ace @mikegalsworthy @Peston None of it is happening yet. In fact, testing has been reduced and only being done in Hospitals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElizAthertonSop @uksciencechief Because they have been deeply involved in the tracking, treatment and surveillance of the outbreak including in China.  Playing at  Russian Roulette is not good enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElizAthertonSop @wafu23RN @LFC_Ace @mikegalsworthy @Peston I would like to see the brief, the detail of what objectives have been set by the Govt for advisers who appear to be rejecting WHO guidelines.  Are the objectives, guided by economics or purely Health driven? .@BBCNews. @EdwardJDavey. @jeremycorbyn. @Ianblackford_MP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElizAthertonSop @uksciencechief I have worked in Health and control of Infection. I am not an expert. WHO are!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElizAthertonSop @wafu23RN @LFC_Ace @mikegalsworthy @Peston World Health Organisation supports testing. Even Trump belatedly is!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElizAthertonSop @wafu23RN @LFC_Ace @mikegalsworthy @Peston Again false. Netherlands are testing and closing Cafes, Restaurants. Johnson is likely a 1950s Mother basically telling The Population to go and. "play with other kids" to catch Mumps, Chickenpox or measles only now its Coronavirus which is killing 5% of those infected in Italy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElizAthertonSop @uksciencechief Perhaps you could tweet WHO advice?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElizAthertonSop @wafu23RN @LFC_Ace @mikegalsworthy @Peston No true. World Health Organisation has guidelines and Britain not following. WHO critical of UK Govt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElizAthertonSop @wafu23RN @LFC_Ace @mikegalsworthy @Peston All European and Asia Govts are testing. I know 3 people who have returned to France after being infected in UK. Plainly figures can be manipulated if testing not done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peston This is critically irresponsible by Govt.   Rest of world is incredulous at this recklessness.  Please, Robert keep exposing how this!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCNews Since Government are Not testing people in Community this info is not reliable. Journalists need to be asking how many Intensive Care Beds taken by those infected by Coronavirus and how many hospitalised. UK approach is extremely complacent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbc5live UK Govt acting irresponsibly and putting millions of vulnerable People at risk by not taking necessary steps.  Johnson complacent from the Start, with mixed messages on handshaking. Make no mistake this is the biggest health emergency for 100 years since Spanish Flu.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilou_rgs Oui, Malheuresement avec une system non proportionelle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilou_rgs Totalement d'accord. Johnson est complete meant fou.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaphaelleBacque @c_ducourtieux Totalement fou et I responsible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MA_Inskip @LaylaMoran What UK are implementing flies in the face of advice from WHO and what other European Governments are implementing. This Herd immunity Strategy will not protect the Elderly and vulnerable.  Complacency writ large is not what is needed, neither is not testing those with symptoms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdwardJDavey UK Government strategy appears to want to get this epidemic over as soon as possible by infecting all - even if it kills Hundreds of thousands of Elderly and middle aged people with existing conditions such as Diabetes and COPD.  All people with symptoms should be tested!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JessMartinezxox @BorisJohnson It's a complete disgrace. Anyone showing signs of symptoms Should  be tested as they are doing in Europe.<|endoftext|>
