<|startoftext|>@michilala Hi bestie!!! Yes I'm so excited!! Round 2!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rest in peace, Brandon Bernard.🕯  You deserved more, better, and you won't be forgotten. Thank you for doing everything you did to make it right. I'm sorry we couldn't do more. I'm sorry the system failed you. You did your best &amp; turned many lives around in your time. Thank you.  https://t.co/WoeeYHrStO<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Final answer for those confused:  The SCOTUS denied the petition. The D.C. DOJ connects to President, who can Pardon. That's why it is our last and final defense move.  Yes American Politics are annoying af and make no damn sense. This shouldn't be happening.  Thanks for RTing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mybonesmending @reputushion It's okay! American Politics are messed up. The SCOTUS denied the petition. The White House DOJ is direct to President, who can Pardon. That's why it is our last and final defense move. Thanks for RTing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mybonesmending @paintdreams13 These are good questions. The SCOTUS denied the petition. The White House DOJ is direct to President, who can Pardon. That's why it is our last and final defense move.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For those asking: Yes SCOTUS denied the petition. Yes POTUS has filters on Twitter.  That's why the last step we can do is CALL the Department of Justice, as I've instructed above in detail, including a VM speech. It is our final try, our last move. Fight until we can't.

<|startoftext|>@sheilavstay @taylorswift13 I sort of wondered if she would, I had a thought, but didn't expect it, if that makes sense. I knew something was coming that would surprise us. I knew how much she was enjoying Folklore and the process. So...kind of. But DEF not tonight!! Maybe next year, after Grammys.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealCandaceO Here's some of my favorite pics of Harry Styles to add to your fan collection, Candace Owens, bc whether YOU like it or not, skirt, heels, short hair, long hair, dress, tux, ballet costume or rockstar, Harry ALWAYS defines a REAL MAN.

<|startoftext|>@aotdts Meh. Never been a "fan" of hers. She always seems legit no pun intended hot &amp; cold and switchy about everything, like she doesn't know who she is or what she's about &amp; I can't get behind that.

<|startoftext|>@mad_lib__ @therecount @BarackObama I acknowledged he built the cages. That IS criticism ~ I also acknowledged he had better management, handling, sensitivity, outcome, etc.  It's called constructive criticism.  I have none for Trump.   Thanks for deflecting my question. Most ppl do. It's always "but what about X".  https://t.co/bKCfp0Hj4q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mad_lib__ @therecount @BarackObama Come up with a better solution than Obama.  Better yet, research the difference between what happened with then during Obama &amp; what happened during Trump, including the nearly 600 kids still missing their families.  Come up with ANY solution that out does both.  I'll wait.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lrihendry TRUMP QUOTES:  "I pounced on her like a b*tch. I don't ask permission. Grab 'em by the p*ssy."

<|startoftext|>@yalligtg Ok. Let me make this simple.  What you missed the main point.  The alcoholic &amp; drunk driving were examples on ENABLING. Take the middle out.   I said ENABLING (cause) "affect everyone else &amp; that is not okay" (effect).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@excusemekevin @oliviawilde 1. I'm not your "fam". 2. No, I won't "chill".  Larries are a constant, consistent embarrassment to Harry Styles, his work projects, etc., &amp; I am beyond tired of my being his "fan" as someone equivalent to a Larry or someone who enables &amp;/or dismisses Larries. We're NOT alike.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elounoreater Fact: Debunked or not, y'all assumed &amp; gossiped &amp; ran for awhile bc you dig all day for breadcrumbs. Fact: Not every Larry debunked. Fact: NO Larries gave a shit to consider Harry. Ever. OR His workplace or coworkers. Fact: Y'all put your agenda 1st, always.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hvdgins Enabling doesn't help. That's like saying, hey, let the alcoholic drink, it's 2020. Let the drunk person drive, as long as they're happy. NO. It affects everyone else and that is not okay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear Larries:  STOP!! Look at what you are doing. To Harry, to his workplace, #DWD cast &amp; crew!!!! You're not only embarrassing the hell out of him (as always), but are forcing his workplace &amp; ppl like @oliviawilde to see &amp; affiliates to have to make statements.  SHAME ON YOU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@poopoopeepepe White girl here, can confirm. I keep the hair extensions on my head clasped tighter than desperate toxic Larries who vow to go down with their ship, &amp; that's saying something!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*also check the original thread's comments...it keeps getting better. 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tiktok trolls make me giggle with their ironic creativity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>QUESTION  Does anyone have a #HarryStyles pattern and/or color scheme of his Cardigan available? It doesn't have to be exact...  My birthday is in 10 days and I'd like to be able to make something like that for myself if I can... it'd be a nice project.   Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cherrysdarling So true, bestie.  Us Harries will go to war to keep Harry as peaceful and protected as can be. We are hot asf.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Equivalent to:  Don't put seatbelts in cars Don't stop that drunk driver Don't hang street signs Don't report r*pe or beating or m*rd*r Don't worry about doing what's best for anyone else as long as YOU'RE unbothered  🖕common sense &amp; decency  Let Americans decide for themselves!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lFlNELlNE I'm Anti bc I believe Louis &amp; am against toxic Larries, BUT I'm also friends w/neutrals &amp; a respectful openminded Larries who treat Harry w/♥️.   To me, it's all about reality vs fantasy &amp; fanfic. No one should be pushing their agendas on them or trying to "win". It's real life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSherrodBrown Good man. TY Sir, for not only standing your ground &amp; continuing to be brave, but for saying what we've all been thinking &amp; being the voice of others in the room that can't speak up! Keep going! Great work. #WearAMask<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@khopejordan &amp; IF Harry IS sick, yes he'd have to quarantine, but not w/Louis which is ALL they're wishing. They legit want him to be sick to be w/L &amp; you're justifying this.

<|startoftext|>@khopejordan @shesgoldhs You're absolutely right.  I must be completely rude for taking offense to the "OR I HOPE HARRY CARRIES IT" aka potentially risking Harry's well-being, bc carrying it can mean he potentially gets sick, struggles, worse, all for the sake of them quarantining together.

<|startoftext|>@hstrepidations 🤣🤣 well I kinda just allowed myself to get consumed into the fandom slowly but surely. I used to keep a solid balance of personal, professional, &amp; fandom ~ now, nope. I can't even control it + I can't distinguish who is who in my followers + laziness, so yeah. My bad.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ugh I feel sick and nervous. I want @taylorswift13 to win sooooo bad. She deserves and has earned this 100xs over, esp this year with #Folklore.

<|startoftext|>@khaz_02 Yes, Juice &amp; The Chain &amp; Wild Thoughts &amp; Girl Crush &amp; Still The One &amp; so many others. Even 1s he did w/1D like Torn &amp; Teenage Dirtbag.

<|startoftext|>@khaz_02 That'd be why I didn't know it, I don't listen to Kanye. 🤣🤣 Harry just made me listen to a Kanye song. Now I'm obsessed with HARRY'S VERSION.

<|startoftext|>😮😮😮😍😍😍🤯🤯🤯  1. I've found more of a Harry cover I haven't heard before!?! (All I've heard is a small clip in a compilation but that's never been enough!) 2. What song is this?! 3. Where can I see the FULL thing?  I NEED IT NOW!  #HARRIES ~ Anyone up for Mission #2?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Why is she so precious?  Why would I be equally as easily entertained as she is by doing this?  Why am I easily just as entertained by watching her be easily entertained by doing this?  Ah, fuck it.   These are #FirstWorldProblems I have actually missed having. Lemme enjoy it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And no, I'm not saying I love Taylor any less, so don't anyone start w/me, go fight w/a wall. You all know she's my QUEEN &amp; Folklore is my baby. She deserves her noms; that's why she got 7! Plus PCAs &amp; more. SHE WILL WIN.  BUT  Harry deserves awards &amp; recognition, too. Period.  https://t.co/9Ccbrqnc83<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FTR: I'm not forcing anyone's hand to vote for Harry, esp out of pity. I'm js if YOU 🧡 both, consider the options &amp; at least VOTE BOTH. Maybe put more votes toward THIS particular category to Harry if YOU desire. IMpo, yes I think he deserves a win &amp; has earned it. 🤷‍♀️🥂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RecordingAcad Fine Line by @Harry_Styles bc the delicate personal writing describes every chapter a person's life can go through &amp; the waves of life in general: how we go up &amp; down from happy &amp; sad and ALL the in-between's, and grow to accept that we are ALWAYS in the middle (the fine line).<|endoftext|>

They go against the grain. They make history. They are changing music. THEY *ARE* THE MUSIC INDUSTRY.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🌟Continuing to: Focus on my son. Focus on me. Focus on writing. Enjoy music, Harry, Taylor. Stay in the now. Remain ZEN!  🚫Block out all the rest. The politics. Noise. Bullies. Bastards. The scary &amp; unsure. Things that are out of my control.  https://t.co/BsAMT1gwiM<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>2B CLEAR: I don't wish Covid19 on ANYONE EVER. COVID19 IS REAL! WEAR A MASK!  I'm ONLY suspicious of Trump bc: •lack of Dr updates •WH actions •denials/downplay •Trump lies 24/7 •he WOULD take advantage •"HOAX!!" •Election sympathy •Everything he does=motive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have many thoughts about WHY this COULD be fake~not saying it is, but:  •Trump losing = #SympathyVotes •Debate was disaster, not ready/doesn't want 2 participate in more •Miracle Cure/Hero •Buying Time •He/RNC wants him OUT •Alibi/Cover-Up  #TrumpHasCovid #TrumpCovidHoax<|endoftext|>

Confirmed: REAL.  •Bravo to the woman who dove across the table &amp; wouldn't let go of the child. •100% RESPECT to the Man In Black who swooped in like a hero, held the kidnapper down, fought, &amp; wouldn't release. •🖕to all the bystanders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snuggleonaraft I follow, please follow me back!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lifeinswift You should. I've already cleared some and I feel better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsgracefolks If you saw the pics though, nothing but abs and tattoos and a wet body and longer hair. ALL MAN. These haters should be ashamed of themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsgracefolks Definitely! Apt pics were leaked from a drone sneaking pics from his villa &amp; some pics were leaked on here and 1D fans &amp; fans of each member but his were FAT &amp; UGLY shaming him endlessly, bashing him ~ trust me, no way in hell are they right-just hating!! I'm ready to go to WAR.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ran across some pics.of Harry w/hair pulled up &amp; in a baseball cap, not from Twitter~I'm assuming these were the 1s taken from his villa?? If so, I won't DARE post.

<|startoftext|>These small lyric changes are so beautiful! I love this cover rendition and change up! @taylorswift13 check this out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*** IF YOU FOLLOW ME, AND I DON'T FOLLOW YOU &amp; YOU WANT ME TO BE FRIENDS WITH YOU, LEAVE ME A COMMENT WITH AN EMOJI, AND I'LL GET TO IT!!  (I'm currently on a Limit Restriction but once I binge, I'll be able to follow the real ones! I just need to know!)  THANKS!! ***<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChelseaMoffatt Alright gotcha babe  https://t.co/0kJ732snuB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChelseaMoffatt Sorry I'm on a follow limit Let me unfollow some peeps who don't follow back real quick  https://t.co/Pk6v7qzeS2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@swifttgrandee @taylorswift13 She stays regardless. The queen always has reign over me. 🤣🤣 Which is why I added "unless I really enjoy your account" ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@augustdynastay For me, it'll be Saturday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So now, my stance is VERY CLEAR.  It was NEVER about me gaining followers, ever. It was me wanting real friendship, community, enjoying my fandoms, speaking my truth, and enjoying this platform. No more pressure or pointless toxicity. No more anxiety. I'm done. 🙅‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bonus Announcement:  IF you ONLY follow bc I host #Giveaways &amp; DON'T CARE ABOUT BEING MY FRIEND, my regular posts, NEVER INTERACT W/ME or bother to get to know me, hate when I post personal/political, &amp; just stick around in hopes to win ~ go ahead &amp; unfollow. Save me ⏰. Thx.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alltoowell3209 P.S. I'm always here for you. As a genuine friend AND if you need to vent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alltoowell3209 Been there time again.  Be warned, they'll unfollow just as quick. They come &amp; they go. Lovely to be a #Giveaway Swiftie who just wants to do good, share love, &amp; make friends. Sorry bb. It sucks. 💔  Note: I usually do 1-2 giveaways a week + secret bonuses. They still get mad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snuggleonaraft Do share<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ANNOUNCEMENT: Next week, gonna do a major UNFOLLOWING SPREE of those who *DO NOT* follow me back, unless I really enjoy your account.  Reason being: I've ALWAYS wanted friends, community, +fun/interaction. Ppl follow me so I'll follow, then remove.  I need a fresh start. Thanks🥂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1 last digital art to share. I made this to describe my brain when one of @taylorswift13's songs on #Reputation or #Lover sends me into a #cosmicrealm, particularly lately, Miss Americana &amp; The Heartbreak Prince, False God, Ready For It, Don't Blame Me, etc. Enjoy 🥂  https://t.co/v8LVFuxE8M<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@repucardigan @taylorswiftvol6 Does "Abditory" count? It's defined as "a secret place to hide". I love it so much, as I am a writer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taylorswiftvol6 🤣🤣 ok cool. Larries set trap tweets to target people so they pretend to dislike/wanna mute/ block Larries then get all their buddies to trash people like me who dare to respond, DM us threats, report our accounts, etc. They're...wild.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mstylest91 @billboard So...you're asking for a pity vote?  Harry hasn't gotten even 2% of the legit recognition, especially w/awards, as he has earned. He works his ass off &amp; charts don't lie. But he gets shamed &amp; guilted on a daily basis. How's that fair?  Besides this is a FANDOM vote, not for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billboard ❤ VOTE FOR THIS GUY ❤  https://t.co/Rit0lbfz1g<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kngoftears Afterglow &amp;  MA&amp;THBP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanRTC4 @serphentide Thank you! "Weston" came to me out of nowhere and I love it. His middle name "Dean" came from @JensenAckles's character in @cw_spn. "Weston Dean" fits him so PERFECTLY. I am one proud mama.  https://t.co/8EGnSDaVli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gayvodka1994 @BBMAs I'm coming full swing with bats and combat hear and a damn speaker hanging out of my car and a megaphone. You can have shotgun. I'm sick and tired of Harry being shunned.  https://t.co/owA5sE2a9o<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gayvodka1994 Oh 100% agreed! Both bc of Bella, *I* think.  He felt like Jacob was a little annoying bug he knew he could squash but didn't have to prove so he just let him bark; plus Bella asked him over to not.  Didn't care to be his friend bc Jake wanted Bella but E respected HER choices.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gayvodka1994 @BBMAs I ❤ Taylor, been a Swiftie since '06, &amp; have always been a die-hard. But this is fan-voted, &amp; she's nominated several times, so I'll vote for both, but if it comes down to the 2 of them, for this one, I'm going with Harry. He deserves the recognition. Tired of him being ignored.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gayvodka1994 E hated Jake w/a passion BUT loved Bella more.  The main reasons J hated Edward were  1: he wanted Bella baddd 2: His heritage brainwashed him into thinking vamps were bad w/o getting to know him personally  But he settled for imprinting on their offspring, I guess 🤷‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gayvodka1994 🤣🤣🤣  https://t.co/fPZEwSY5AT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gayvodka1994 Yet he got ONE nomination for the #BBMAs ... and no shade to Billie's music, but how is she still nominated as Best New Artist when she won multiple Grammys &amp; others last year, and got nom'd in main categories AGAIN this year for @BBMAs~BB, explain, bro?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gayvodka1994 Nahhhhh. The only reason Jacob lived was because of Bella; otherwise pup's balls wouldn't have even had the chance to drop. Edward would've beheaded that child with his teeth. 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gayvodka1994 + his band has said Harry can be hair triggered when he needs to be and isn't afraid to call it like it is. I even recall Mitch (I think?) saying he's seen Harry snap once, it wasn't pretty, &amp; he was terrified. Those quiet/"gentle" ones are ALWAYS the ones to look out for. 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsgracefolks @Twitter It's been doing that to me, too. So help me God if I get removed or shadow banned. Whyyyyy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@godslittlemesss @USPS Thank you, that means so much to me. I'm beyond grateful I have you and true friends like you. I do love my community.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JeffreeStar $AngelaShrum Thanks Jeffree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwiftPola @USPS Thx bb. I feel like I've been annoying you (&amp; my #SwiftieSquad lately with all my DMs) so I kinda went silent in hopes to stop irritating everyone. I just FELT it, idk. (Sorry @gwensgalriri, @urnotmyhomeland, @americavdynasty, @sheilavstay, @lNVISIBLESTRlNG, @BlankSpaceProd) 😭💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taylorswift13 &amp; @taylornation13 &amp; @treepaine  My good friend &amp; fellow #Swiftie is going through an extremely difficult time and it would mean the world to her/us if you would take a moment to read her tweet &amp; make any contribution you possibly can! 🙏<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@khaz_02 Thank you, hon. I see you too and I'm glad we're friends.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Maxwell5SOS @bettertearss @willou28 Agreed. I'm tired of toxic fanatics, name calling, threats, pointless online fights. I just wish people would let the men be, fans can enjoy the content, and not everything would be twisted into a war. #OverIt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ineedyaataylor Well my offer stands bc you're my friend and I care. If we lived near eachother, you'd be stuck with me doing it.   As far as selling, jewelry, clothes, merch, accessories, knickknacks, art, I've done it all! GoFundMe?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lifeinswift @USPS Thank you bb. I took a week rest about 10 days ago. Felt better. Now I'm down again bc I was so excited to see everyone &amp; rejoin my community. Guess I either have to face my new reality or take another pause.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The hardest part is, even though I do giveaways, I actually follow back those who follow me for the giveaways &amp; interact with y'all. So to see myself lose 500+ followers in 4 weeks makes me sad bc I don't look for "followers", I look for friendships &amp; community. I really do CARE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beTaylorSwiftie @USPS Thank you bb, that means a lot. It's just been hard seeing myself lose over 500+ followers in 4 weeks, especially considering I follow them back AND interact with them. Want them as friends more than another follower.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lifeinswift @USPS Could be, idk. I'm working PT + reconsidering another degree + am a mama &amp; I try to be active as much as possible but I shouldn't assume everyone has the time. Maybe I'm taking things personal. It's just been a huge drop + I've lost like 500 followers in 4 weeks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bettertearss @willou28 Exactly. Can we have some Harry legitimacy without Larries having to ruin everything with manufactured manips? It's the same damn day even. Not even 24 hours have passed. LET HARRY BE.  https://t.co/OSe25agtcl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lifeinswift @USPS I'm ok just bummed. I miss my friends on here and my usual interactions. I miss making new friends. I miss laughing and excitement, discussing things new and old. Finding breadcrumbs. Discovering things. Everything seems so off and everyone seems gone. 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@forthegayssss I am so jealous. He is the sweetest, most patient 🤗😭❤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lifeinswift @USPS Hey hon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hardly any1 talks 2 me anymore now that I've been FORCED 2 pause my #giveaways due 2 stupid @USPS delaying my mail 4 month+. I thought I was more 2 #Swifties/fandoms than just a "Giveaway Girl". Lost fllwrs. I interact daily, ✔ in w/friends, show 💗. I LOVE y'all.   Ngl=hurts.💔  https://t.co/blT8eoeSQF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1989KISSY Yeah I'm freaking out and pissed bc of the damn BBMAs on account of Harry being robbed, of Taylor/Harry forced to being pitted against one another and them forcing US to battle it out (let's face it, Tay has biggest fanbase).  What content are Harries freaking out over? The MV?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ineedyaataylor I'm so sorry hon. I understand the cost uprising and it's so unfair. I'll help in any way I possibly can. And I'm offering my services as well. It isn't a trouble and you're not asking ~ I'm offering as a friend. If you need help, I am here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1989KISSY I have no idea... harries seem...meh, ok. Swifties seem...meh, ok.  Haylors seem distraught as hell. But everyone just seems OFF.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@swiftinyourarea @euphoriaHBO @Zendaya @taylorswift13 @Harry_Styles I wasn't "putting Taylor's name in it" to get attention, I just can't find the quote atm bc I don't archive. &amp; Harry &amp; Tay were BONUS reasons I've wanted to watch it. I apologize my tweet triggered you so bad but you don't have to attack. I meant no harm. They are/were friends🤷‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you find it ODD that some people EXPECT their fav celebrity 2publicly announce every time they:  •make a new friend •end a friendship •make up w/a friend •get into a relationship •breakup w/someone •watch/listen to something •eat, fart, scratch their ass ?? BC IT'S ODD.  https://t.co/BFulE3Rx9v<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaylornation Exactly. They mention artists to get viewers to watch and then award people no one knows. It's not about selling records or impact anymore. Makes me sick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@augustwhispers I get this feeling. 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaylornation I'm normal and Red did deserve a fucking Grammy. Reputation deserved a Grammy, too.  Now I wanna trend #GrammysAreBoughtNotEarned<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tbslxlou Agreed. I used to get made fun of for liking Robert Pattinson back in the good ol days, and now Rob's on everyone's list. I used to get made fun of liking everything that wasn't cool &amp; then it became cool &amp; then it was cool to hate on them. DO YOU, BOO.🖕THE ASSHOLES. I got you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@serphentide Thank you I appreciate it. I've just become sort of 🤷‍♀️. Most days I don't keep 🤫 on it but occ I get 😖 bc I still get attacked bc it's a war of Haylor/Larry~but I do keep up w things &amp; I do love both the boys &amp; their friendship. Just wish ppl didn't try to OUT anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@serphentide *YT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@serphentide I guess when I aim my "against Larry Stylinson" stuff it's more toward the ppl that hurt me so bad than the actual ship, bc I immediately associate it/the fandom with all the cruel people that hurt me and the over the top. (I secretly still watch vids on YY though)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@serphentide I used to be esp back in the day! Twitter ruined it for me, esp when I came out as #Haylor ~ I got hated on &amp; bashed really bad. Got called names &amp; threatened. Friends turned on me just for loving Taylor (been a fan since '06). Got pushed out &amp; felt I had to choose. 💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@serphentide I adore Louis and their friendship. I love Louis attitude sfm, esp when he's annoyed or pissed and just says it how it is. 🤣 I can't wait to get his record.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fineelines @hsadoreeyou Oooh I love this!!! Stunning!! I love your entire look. I want styling tips. Those eyebrows. Nails. Lashes. Freckles!  (And you put Conor o DonoHOEEEEE to shame. 🤣🤣🤣 You have class who gives credit. He's a wannabe ass.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@serphentide Only man I need is my son, and to stare at Harry Styles and Robert Pattinson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tlgadtaylor @afterglowstyle Yup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afterglowstyle I know. I'm PISSED. Harry was ROBBED and how dare the @BBMAs pit them against each other, and then force US to vote when we love them both? #HarryWasRobbed Don't even get me started on Billie Eilish still being nominated as Best NEW Artist. Smdh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shetrepidations I don't know what we're claiming or how to claim but I wanna be a part of the cool kids. 😭😭 Someone do charity work, yank me off the short bus, and teach me the Claim Game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tbslxlou I always pick Harry - there's no one above. But if you truly love both and have trouble deciding something important, like a fan vote on an award, take a shot of tequila and flip a coin?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@serphentide Amen! 🙌 I'm so comfortable being single. It seems the more single I am, the more men are interested &amp; try and the more laughs I have, therefore: Single = Joy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@serphentide 🤣🤣🤣 it'd have to be an immaculate pregnancy since I haven't had sex since like April and I'm happily single now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@serphentide East   WEIRD!!! My son's name is Weston. How did that happen? (Ps that would never happen! 🤣)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tsinstorybrooke I'm sittin' eyes wide open and I got one thing stuck in my mind:  Wondering if I dodged a bullet or just lost the love of my life?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tsinstorybrooke &amp; my words shoot 2kill when I'm mad I have a lot of regrets about that I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere Fell behind all my classmates &amp;I ended up here Pourin' out my heart 2a stranger But I didn't pour the whiskey I just wanted u 2know That this is me trying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tsinstorybrooke Every single lyric of Last Kiss 😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tsinstorybrooke It's tragedy &amp; it'll only bring you down. Now I don't know what to be without you around.  &amp; we know it's never simple, never easy, Never a clean break. No one here to save me. You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand.  And I can't breathe without you But I have to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tsinstorybrooke Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day So, just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through I've never been anywhere cold as you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tsinstorybrooke Cause when you're fifteen &amp; somebody tells you they love you You're gonna believe them &amp; when you're fifteen Don't forget to look before you fall I've found time can heal most anything &amp; you just might find who you're supposed to be Idk who I was supposed to be at fifteen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tsinstorybrooke Busy streets That never bring u back 2me I can't help but wish u took me w/u  This is when the feeling sinks n Id wanna missU like this Come back b here I guess ur in London 2day I don't wanna need u this way  This is falling n❤ n the cruelest way Falling 4u when u r worlds away<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tsinstorybrooke I wake in the night I pace like a ghost The room is on fire Invisible smoke &amp; all of my heroes Die all alone Help me hold on to you  I've been the archer I've been the prey Screaming, "Who could ever leave me darling... But who could stay?"  I see right through me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tsinstorybrooke Your kiss, my cheek, I watched you leave Your smile, my ghost, I fell to my knees When you're young you just run But you come back 2what you need  This love is good, this love is bad This love is alive back from the dead These hands had to let it go free &amp; this love came back 2me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tsinstorybrooke Hey, it's all me, in my head I'm the one who burned us down But it's not what I meant Sorry that I hurt you I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go Meet me in the afterglow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tsinstorybrooke U knew it still hurt underneath my scars From when they pulled me apart But what u did was just as dark Darling this was just as hard My only1 My kingdom come undone My broken drum U have beaten my heart Dont want no other shade of blue But u No other sadness n the world would do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tsinstorybrooke 'Cause I knew you Stepping on the last train Marked me like a bloodstain, I I knew you Tried to change the ending Peter losing Wendy I, I knew you Leaving like a father Running like water, I When you are young, they assume you know nothing  But I knew you'd linger<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ggirlchrisy @BBMAs @Eminem I know and every year I get more pissed. I know Em doesn't give a single shit about awards anymore but he still deserves them and the damn recognition.

<|startoftext|>Here is the link to @taylorswift13's Voting Resources she included:   https://t.co/C6GdIZIqln<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I screenrecored the video of #TaylorSwift from her Insta today, reminding us it is #NationalVoterRegistrationDay, so make sure YOU are registered to VOTE!! ᵖˢˢᵗ ᶠᵘˡˡ ᵈᵉᵐᵒᶜʳᵃᵗ ᵇᵃˡˡᵒᵗ  Do your part by 𝗹𝗶𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 &amp; 𝗥𝗧𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 tweet so all can see! 🗳🇺🇲  https://t.co/h9DxGnykRI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Btw @BBMAs ~ where are @Eminem's nominations? Pretty sure he SMASHED charts (&amp; records), including his own, with 2 surprise drop albums, #Kamikaze &amp; #MusicToBeMurderedBy. Top Sales? Top Rap Artist? Top Rap Album? Top Stream? Male Rap Artist? Etc?  https://t.co/1gLTLt8f2J<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a 2-pt #BBMAs @BBMAs quest: A. How tf did @Harry_Styles get ONLY ONE nom~yet it's "BB Chart Achievement Award"  B. How is @billieeilish STILL nom'd as "Top New Artist" after past yrs of Grammys+, when THAT should be Harry +she has 11 NOMS?! She's not NEW.#HarryWasRippedOff  https://t.co/zFwbGqr1of<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maftuna_1304 He turned into a kitten and rubbed up against my shoulder and said, "Aww she liked it. Does she like kittens too?" 🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@godslittlemesss Hw says "haha that person says haaaiiiii like I do when I'm trying to annoy you, Mama!" 🤣🤣 "They get me." Then he decided to be sweet and say "Lucky mama, you take me to do fun stuff, ily very much". (Such a suckup.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Twitter needs an auto-translation~not just per tweet, but per reply, bc my brain 🤯 trying to figure it out alone.

<|startoftext|>@ineedyaataylor We're so relieved to know you are feeling better! #CancerSucks We would love to meet you and see hoping with all our hearts you'll be reunited soon w/her!

<|startoftext|>@madwomanTS8 He says, "you're welcome sugar!" (OMG)  Then picked this one: (I CAN'T WITH HIM)  https://t.co/oSb8VQuyuh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My son will be 8yo in October and he's killing the game. Such a charmer. So much confidence mixed with innocence. I'm gonna have gray hair before I hit mid-30s. Y'all should read his responses. 🤣🙈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gwensgalriri He said, "oooooh, I like her name. She's beautiful too. Mama do the dog emotion, like ruff, like I wanna play." (OMG MY SON) 🐶🐾  He's gonna have me dead by the time he hits pre-teen. #LadiesMan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madwomanTS8 He said, "tell her that YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL." Then he started making kitten noises and asked, "what will she say back?"  Then asked me to insert a kitten so: 😽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Katherinedb_ He said, "She said "Hi Weston, awe so cute"...cause I AM cute. Mama why are you laughing? Just bc I'm cute doesn't mean you have to laugh.  Oh, tell her HIIIIIIII! And mama give her a rose emoji, k?" So, for you:🌹  (Yes, he's a charmer.)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@harryguccidoll Best: live performances, lights up, wms, carpool karaoke, making mutuals, having laughs   Worse: Larry Stylinson, Harry getting slammed for breaking up band or discredited for his work bc "he's got enough attention", Harry being ignored by industry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>STOP spreading rumors about Taylor/Joe breaking up. Jaylor seemed just fine a few days ago. Just bc they're working in separate places doesn't mean anything.

<|startoftext|>@lNVISIBLESTRlNG 100% taste! I've had that one stuck in my head for days! I keep thinking about her explaining it, about how she had the idea of fighting against the storm until she decided to punch a hole in the roof and let the storm pour in until she became clean. So good.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@taylorswift13 IS the woMAN!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamhaunted13 I honestly don't know! The strike was for using "Betty". The other knocks was for typing ACM awards different ways. I eventually gave up. I'm sure there are workarounds but I'm not sure. Sorry babe!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamhaunted13 I kept trying and YT blocked me 3x's and 1 strike already so be careful how you label a d tag it! They're being dicks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So surprising bc #Betty𐂅 was the ONLY song on #Folklore I wasn't feeling or connected to &amp; I've stated that publicly. Only TS song I didn't fangirl over in years.  Now I'm eating crow. I was wrong, I admit it!! Thanks, Taylor!  https://t.co/l91Of68UZ0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't believe the first live @taylorswift13 performance of #Folklore was #Betty𐂅 &amp; she made me LOVE it. I got EMOTIONAL! This is the power of my QUEEN, truly. She makes me feel &amp; care &amp; CHANGE. I love her sfm, words can't describe. 😭 Taylor SLAYED it! Officially a BETTY fan~🤯!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have had the honor of meeting @DanAndShay a cpl times &amp; am so proud of seeing how far they've come as artists. Their performance tonight at #ACMawards's was PERFECT. So happy the world gets to see how amazing they are. They deserve all the success! Humble gents!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love this song!! @GabbyBarrett_ &amp; @CadeFoehner has one killer vocal! Everytime it pops up, I rock out to it. #ACMawards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>** #ACMawards ~ my hashtag popped up CMAs for some reason. Guess it was already drunk. 🤷‍♀️ Thanks, Country Music! Look what you made my hashtags do! 🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shakeitoff92 🤣🤣🤣🤣 whoops!!! Idk why that hashtag popped up. Dammit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tenilletownes ~ #SomebodysDaughter just slammed into me. AMAZING writing!! Incredibly powerful impact. You're right, everyone should hear it. You just made a new fan in me tonight! I see why you're the New Artist! Congrats! #ACMawards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If we took a shot every time a country artist sang about drinking tonight on the #CMAawards, we'd ALL already be in the hospital for alcohol poisoning, and we're ONLY an HOUR in the 3-hour special  ~ that's saying something considering some of us *cough🙋‍♀️* can draaank. 🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kanyewest Kanye, keep @taylorswift13's name out of your mouth. You didn't make her, she made YOU and apparently YOU NEED HER to keep you relevant.

<|startoftext|>@sheilavstay @taylorswift13 Exactly. You never know. Always better to err on the side of caution and report behavior like this, whether it's online or heard in person. You could be saving lives. That's worth it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@duchesspoppy1 @taylorswift13 True there are keyboard criminal wannabe's, BUT interesting fact~while advocating for a decade+ I've found that those who "joke" about rape w/o consequence are 6x's more likely to attempt it. #RapeCulture spreads so if friends see it, they'll do it too.  I appreciate you all!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sheilavstay @taylorswift13 I'm pretty sure @ TheMemeKraken is a man, but regardless, it's unacceptable!  I've been extremely forthcoming with  overcoming my own rape &amp; advocating for survivors &amp; I don't allow this. He could severely harm someone, or maybe has! It's disgusting &amp; disturbing &amp; violent &amp; sick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goodgirlchrisy @taylorswift13 Thank you hon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@duchesspoppy1 @taylorswift13 Thank you very much!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skittlesxoreo @taylorswift13 Thank you dear! It helps!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So this happened bc I defended @taylorswift13 today...was aimed solely at me.  Humans of all ages: do NOT accept this BS. This is a serious threat of violence that cannot be ignored. @ TheMemeKraken is just ONE example &amp; it's NEVER OKAY.  Help me in reporting his account. Thanks.  https://t.co/JOsnzYgycl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khaleeswift @TheMemeKraken @goodgirlchrisy @Swiftsbeatles13 @SquireMorgan @knifekiddo @folklorde13 And threaten me with rape &amp; shooting hollowed points at me.

<|startoftext|>@khaleeswift @TheMemeKraken @goodgirlchrisy @Swiftsbeatles13 @SquireMorgan @knifekiddo @folklorde13 You know ~ you MIGHT be onto something. But then again, "14 year old girl" would be giving him more credit than deserved with his weakass efforts. Let's stick w/11yo. They're prepubescent, too hormonal, triggered easily, refuse to listen to reason, etc. That fits better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khaleeswift @TheMemeKraken @goodgirlchrisy @Swiftsbeatles13 @SquireMorgan @knifekiddo @folklorde13 Ikr? It is pitiful. I mean, he's been torched for quite a while now &amp; is disintegrating as we speak, but he's like a pesky little cockroach carrying it's dead body around until its last brain cell is gone.

<|startoftext|>@TheMemeKraken @goodgirlchrisy @Swiftsbeatles13 @SquireMorgan @knifekiddo @folklorde13 Wow..stooping this low bc you don't have a leg to stand on.  Yeah, buddy. I do. Been an Em fan since 1998. But I'm not gonna entertain your ass simply bc you lost. Go. Cry. Elsewhere. You're DONE. Everyone sees it. Pick up your tail &amp; go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMemeKraken @khaleeswift @goodgirlchrisy @Swiftsbeatles13 @SquireMorgan @knifekiddo @folklorde13 "Slammed" with your OPINIONS, not justifiable facts. And calling her a "bitch" continuously just PROVES you don't have a pot to piss in, so please stop embarrassing yourself. It's quite pitiful to watch you spiral like this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMemeKraken @goodgirlchrisy @Swiftsbeatles13 @SquireMorgan @knifekiddo @folklorde13 Honey I don't need to use lyrics in my defense. You're taking things way too personal. Did I hit that big of a nerve? Damn you are triggered. Here, this will help:  https://t.co/kQvOkWGUlq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMemeKraken @goodgirlchrisy @Swiftsbeatles13 @SquireMorgan @knifekiddo @folklorde13 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  https://t.co/gBzkYMBJ5y<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMemeKraken @goodgirlchrisy @Swiftsbeatles13 @SquireMorgan @knifekiddo @folklorde13 🤣🤣🤣 Dude, you already called it &amp; caved. Pitiful, really, that you're still resorting to these tactics &amp; now bringing up rape in any context to try and hurt me for losing the fight you started? You're done, fried, served, digested &amp; shit out. Bye!✌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMemeKraken @goodgirlchrisy @Swiftsbeatles13 @SquireMorgan @knifekiddo @folklorde13 🤣🤣🤣 Yeah, I got dropped as I debunked everything, swung with additional points, knocked it out of the park with reduced simplistic deductions &amp; am still here.  So I guess you're calling it then? "End of Fucking Discussion" = I'm a bitchboy out of ammo.  Very well.✌ Cheers. 🥂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMemeKraken @goodgirlchrisy @Swiftsbeatles13 @SquireMorgan @knifekiddo @folklorde13 I debunked all! You can't just claim 2 have points bc you share bias opinions. I can't debunk your butthurt emotions~they're yours.   You wanna come w UNBIAS FACTS? I'm here all day. You wanna bitch &amp; throw tantrums &amp; skirt around facts? Go cry in a safe space; I'm not your mama.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMemeKraken @goodgirlchrisy @Swiftsbeatles13 @SquireMorgan @knifekiddo @folklorde13 "I didn't even know Taylor Swift had an album"~ really? Come on, dude. We all know that's a lie. Seriously this is the BS that you're coming with? All BIAS opinions?? All TRIGGER SHOTS bc you have nothing substantial? Give up child.  https://t.co/tF2YtnEBKU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khaleeswift @TheMemeKraken @goodgirlchrisy @Swiftsbeatles13 @SquireMorgan @knifekiddo @folklorde13 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMemeKraken @goodgirlchrisy @Swiftsbeatles13 @SquireMorgan @knifekiddo @folklorde13 He IS our fav artist! That's the WHOLE point.  But 4 the sake of your fickle mind, I'm keeping my personal bias/opinions out &amp; sticking to FACTS. Not insults or temper tantrums or anything, as you asked. Can't handle having the ADULT DEBATE you REQUESTED? Don't start shit. 🤷‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMemeKraken @goodgirlchrisy @Swiftsbeatles13 @SquireMorgan @knifekiddo @folklorde13 Again doing BASIC MATH: Eminem sold 235.2M with 17 albums~13.8/yr. Taylor sold 215M with 7 albums in 10 years LESS~30.71/yr. If we made it equal &amp; Em &amp; Tay started/ended at same time &amp; same amount of records:  30.7 T ÷ 13.8 E= Em would STILL scrape behind with underselling 2M/yr.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMemeKraken @goodgirlchrisy @Swiftsbeatles13 @SquireMorgan @knifekiddo @folklorde13 AGAIN w/the insults &amp; personal attacks bc you're upset that math, science &amp; logical facts debunk your OPINIONS. We are meant to have a professional discussion, sir.  This PROVES that in 10 yrs LESS w/10 ALBUMS LESS than Em, Tay is right up beside him, meaning she sells FASTER. ++  https://t.co/RlJ6ecp7i6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMemeKraken @goodgirlchrisy @Swiftsbeatles13 @SquireMorgan @knifekiddo @folklorde13 Honey, review the math I did. You'll see. (Perhaps you should read it slower when you aren't as triggered by intellectual facts?)  Btw, your math is still off. You need to round that up, doll.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMemeKraken @goodgirlchrisy @Swiftsbeatles13 @SquireMorgan @knifekiddo @folklorde13 Pt 2  https://t.co/xf4YaExfWh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMemeKraken @goodgirlchrisy @Swiftsbeatles13 @SquireMorgan @knifekiddo @folklorde13 No sweetheart. You're counting his album sales AND singles, but only counting Taylor's album sales. Here you go.  Pt 1  https://t.co/N303WqSa8M<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMemeKraken @goodgirlchrisy @Swiftsbeatles13 @SquireMorgan @knifekiddo @folklorde13 Pt 2.  https://t.co/0TbHydLjnP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMemeKraken @goodgirlchrisy @Swiftsbeatles13 @SquireMorgan @knifekiddo @folklorde13 @TheMemeKraken  https://t.co/HukzbidYZz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMemeKraken @Swiftsbeatles13 @SquireMorgan @goodgirlchrisy @knifekiddo @folklorde13 NO I didn't take shots at Em~read SLOWER. I said your use of typecast can go both ways &amp; it is without merit.  2nd, we agreed on no insults &amp; maintaining professionalism. The fact that you're immediately floundering back only proves your opinions don't carry weight on their own.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goodgirlchrisy @TheMemeKraken @Swiftsbeatles13 @SquireMorgan @knifekiddo @folklorde13 Sidenote : His username is @TheMemeKraken .  "Kraken" is defined as an enormous mythological sea monster who can't be taken down...  Pretty sure I just did? 🤷‍♀️ OOPS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goodgirlchrisy @TheMemeKraken @Swiftsbeatles13 @SquireMorgan @knifekiddo @folklorde13 🤷‍♀️ He wanted professionalism. I gave it. I'm still here waiting for him to reply... any day now @TheMemeKraken.  https://t.co/PACTtYeDlX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMemeKraken @Swiftsbeatles13 @SquireMorgan @goodgirlchrisy @knifekiddo @folklorde13 @TheMemeKraken I've given 5 solid points to that have debunked your statements. Are you still with me? It's your turn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMemeKraken @Swiftsbeatles13 @SquireMorgan @goodgirlchrisy @knifekiddo @folklorde13 Another thing to mention, playing Devil's Advocate, is I LOVE Em but he's typecast the same way you are typecasting Taylor.  "Taylor only writes breakup songs"  ...okay well  "Em always complains about being poor/rich/depressed".  It's overused bluster w/o researching facts. 🤷‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMemeKraken @Swiftsbeatles13 @SquireMorgan @goodgirlchrisy @knifekiddo @folklorde13 Taylor's inducted in the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, CMA Hall of Fame &amp; Songwriters Hall of Fame due to her master lyricism &amp; storytelling.  She's multi-genre bc she can DO all genres &amp; continues to smash records. Em is multi-genre too, fyi.  They both write their experiences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMemeKraken @Swiftsbeatles13 @SquireMorgan @goodgirlchrisy @knifekiddo @folklorde13 Ok. I'll keep it professional, you do the same. Don't insult me, don't insult Taylor just bc you hate her/whatever...just provide FACTS. Be intellectual. Stay on point.  This is your shot. I'm giving it to you right now. Go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMemeKraken @Swiftsbeatles13 @SquireMorgan @goodgirlchrisy @knifekiddo @folklorde13 @TheMemeKraken ~ In order to actually debate something, you have to know all the FACTS on EVERY side about BOTH. That's something both Em &amp; Taylor do ~ their research. SO if you WANT to have an ADULT DISCUSSION, we can. I just don't think you're capable as your 1.6 GPA limits it.  https://t.co/WSD6q5pCMV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMemeKraken @Swiftsbeatles13 @SquireMorgan @goodgirlchrisy @knifekiddo @folklorde13 Wow AND you're so sensitive. I hit a nerve.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Swiftsbeatles13 @TheMemeKraken @SquireMorgan @goodgirlchrisy @knifekiddo @folklorde13 Who the fuck pissed in your Cheerios, @TheMemeKraken? Was it Taylor?   ...wait. Did she, but Em didn't take a shit in them and provide a dictionary after?  I see. Poor thing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Back when we were still changing for the better Wanting was enough For me, it was enough To live for the hope of it all Cancel plans just in case you'd call &amp; say meet me behind the mall So much for summer love &amp; saying "Us" Cause you weren't mine to lose.  https://t.co/CI6oAxLRun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fifty years is a long time Holiday House sat quietly on that beach Free of women with madness Their men and bad habits, and then it was bought by me  Who knows, if I never showed up what could've been?  I had a marvelous time ruining everything.  https://t.co/gmx4BxfDsv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only 20 minutes to sleep But you dream of some epiphany Just one single glimpse of relief To make some sense of what you've seen  With you, I serve With you, I fall down Down Watch you breathe in Watch you breathin' out Out  Only 20 minutes to sleep...  https://t.co/iL5vzU1ErX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now I breathe flames each time I talk My cannons all firing at your yacht They say "move on" But you know I won't.

<|startoftext|>I Did Something Bad Getaway Car This Love Afterglow Cruel Summer Last Kiss  ...and I'll go down fighting for August to be a single but with everyone demanding Exile, I bet it'll be on this list soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalvinHarris - used &amp; abused &amp; manipulated &amp; pressured her. Extremely controlling. Blasted her every chance he got. Most disrespectful POS ever.   (Thank God @twhiddleston stepped in with his sharp tux &amp; charm &amp; zero expectations! &amp; then he bowed out gracefully. Sigh.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Harry_Styles ~ most respectful. Gave her a lot of song material &amp; the best songs. Never utters a bad thing. Still a constant muse. 🥰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/T8vPl7IQkf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😭 don't make me but ok.  • Cardigan • August • _____________??? ** it ALWAYS changes between Seven, This Is Me Trying, Mirrorball, Exile, Illicit Affairs, the 1, Invisible String, Mad Woman, Hoax, &amp;&amp; The Lakes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>• Miss Americana &amp; The Heartbreak Prince  • Afterglow • Cruel Summer ~ bonus: False God IS that bitch &amp; y'all need to recognize. @taylorswift13 sings her ass off on the track &amp; maintains control at the same time. Everything about it is amazing. Production, melody, lyrics = 🤯!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ARGHHH picking apart this album is like deciding between my favorite children.  Ok I'm just gonna go with... • I Did Something Bad • Getaway Car  • Call It What You Want<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>• This Love • Wildest Dreams  • Clean Also~ there are no damn skips on 1989. If you disagree, you're wrong and I don't trust you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>• Begin Again • All Too Well 😭😭💔 • Red / I Almost Do Also~ I Knew You Were Trouble, Everything Has Changed, Sad Beautiful Tragic, State Of Grace, The Last Time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>• Back To December • Dear John • Last Kiss Also Enchanted, Haunted, Sparks Fly, Long Live, Ours<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>• Forever &amp; Always (Piano Version) • White Horse • Breathe Also Fifteen, Come In With The Rain, You Belong With Me, Love Story, You're Not Sorry, Fearless (&amp; you can't make me discount them.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>• Tim McGraw/Teardrops On My Guitar (Radio Single Mix)  [I constantly switch between the two.] • Cold As You  • Our Song<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In no order... •Fifteen  •Cardigan •...Ready For It? •I Knew You Were Trouble •Wildest Dreams •Safe &amp; Sound •Style •Out Of The Woods •Delicate  •End Game<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Don't get it twisted; this is not me blasting LGTBTQ+. I am VERY vocal about my support.  I just don't think anyone should demand another person is/was/should be gay, for any reason. That isn't fair.  I can't imagine how it makes @taylorswift13 feel.  Think about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It really irritates me when ppl swear she's something she isn't bc it'd be pleasing, or satisfying for YOU to see &amp; say, "I was right!".  Denying logic &amp; reason to fit your agenda? Not cool.  Seriously WISHING someone else to be gay? Who even are you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taylorswift13 has always been willing to stand up for what she believes in &amp; share bits of herself with us when she doesn't have to &amp; even when it bites her in the ass. She is so open. IF she were gay, WHY would she hide it? I know our girl &amp; I don't think she'd do that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll NEVER understand the obsession/stans over @taylorswift13 &amp; @karliekloss (#Kaylor), ESPECIALLY staking your life to swear they were in a romantic relationship &amp;🖕to anyone who dares to disagree.  I wish someone would explain their logic rationally bc...I don't get it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@urnotmyhomeland You made my night for sure! I KNEW we were destined to be friends! Then I became friends with your friends through the fandom &amp; now we're all a little family. I'm forever grateful to you!  That's why I put a ring on it! 🤣😍😘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@urnotmyhomeland Tysm!! You guys made it so much fun!! I had a blast doing that 1st giveaway...that's when I KNEW I was going to do more, that I was doing the right thing. Bc of YOU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notenchanted0 This is the sweetest comment ever!! 😭🤗 thank you so much!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@maelovestaylor  https://t.co/pJJbClu2PN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jllellrd @urnotmyhomeland It's ok hon! No worries!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jllellrd @urnotmyhomeland This isn't a winner announcement hon! It's just an interaction post she made discussing what it's like to be a giveaway host!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So yeah. I don't do it for followers. I do it bc I love the fandom. I do it to share the love, to make others as happy as I am, to make memories, make friends, &amp; be kind. That's the reward. 🏆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ALSO! Sometimes when my followers just interact with me on regular posts, threads, discussions, &amp; cheer me up laugh with me, &amp; it touches me, I pop in their DMs when they have no idea &amp; SURPRISE them with a SECRET #GIVEAWAY only for them that NO ONE ELSE knows!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...package unique bc I want them to know they're special &amp; unique, &amp; I value them as a FRIEND, not just a follower.  9x/10 I also pick BONUS winners who stand out in my #giveaways &amp; will send them something similar or smaller, just to say I SEE &amp; APPRECIATE you! That meant a lot!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can CAPTURE the moment! That when they look at it down the line they'll always say, I remember when...and how I felt.... I LOVE surprising them! I love popping up in the DMs. I include special individual notes when I mail their packages. Bonus items. Secret things. I make each...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BUT!! I DO IT bc I LOVE LOVE to give! I am a giver! I am a happy person. I want to make others happy! To make their day or week or month! To maybe give them their 1st piece of swag! Their 1st rare item! A memorable piece! Something special we share as friends! Something that...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've had 1 person who won as a bonus winner, whom I selected bc I thought they deserved it bc I liked their post, switch around &amp; truly hurt me &amp; lie about me &amp; to me. For NO reason. I hate it. I'm STILL hurt. Feels there's no way of pleasing everyone fully no matter how I try.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another thing that sucks is ppl getting angry. I'm a ppl pleaser. I always feel like I'm letting ppl down. I wish I could make everyone happy. I don't want to hurt anyone. I wish I had MORE. Sometimes I overdo it on my end to please others. I'm tender hearted &amp; it eats at me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which is another reason why I do #giveaways, other than to share the love of an artist i have &amp; share things I'm lucky enough to get myself (sponsored or not) w/those i know can't get. I LOVE to give. But if I can build a friendship too? All the better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...don't get me wrong, most are grateful, as am I to do it! I'm not doing it for a follower count. But if you saw the #s shoot up &amp; right back down it, you can't HELP but feel "bought" sometimes. I look for TRUE friendships in the fandom, I seek connections when I post...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THANK YOU you to fiance @urnotmyhomeland for this thoughtful post, where she sincerely asks about what it's like to host a #giveaway &amp; takes time to thank those of us who do it! This touched my heart strings, as it can feel ppl jump in then right back out, us unthanked &amp; mad at..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> https://t.co/COgKMZe9mt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...well I'll be DAMMED.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>&amp; I can still see it all In my mind All of you, all of me Intertwined I once believed love would be Black &amp; white But it's golden &amp; I can still see it all In my head Back &amp; forth from NY Sneaking in your bed I once believed love would be Burning red But it's golden Like daylight  https://t.co/ckkITYrtlS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye  😮😮😮😮😮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last song... #Daylight...  https://t.co/xwxtfbRrE1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was cute. Very pure. I remember clips on MA of her chilling and playing her ukelele so that was sweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is adorable. She's playing on the ukelele!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, the nostalgia... I miss being young!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We know how I feel about #Me. It grew on me after #MissAmericana on @Netflix.  Next, #ITsNiceToHaveAFriend...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Afterglow is my shit. It's my peanut butter. It's my jam. It's my wine. It's my whole fucking picnic. I'm rockin &amp; rollin w/it!  There's NOTHING better than a song with honest lyrics &amp; a magical production! Esp when that song says look, I messed up but I need you. Lemme fix it.😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/NkqtqTAvsA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/6WNZIn02Zu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh. My. Gosh  This Sooongggggg  https://t.co/EJRlKXW89a<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oooooohh 😍😍😍😍😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh Taylor, I feel you. I've been here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We all know how much I love YNTCD! 🏳️‍🌈🌈  Next, #Afterglow...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love too much about FG. It's sooo good. The vibes, production, the way she used her vocals, her power and softness (it's DIFFERENT here!!)...gotta sense of mythology and sensuality...different genre blends. Magic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FALSE GOD is another FAV!! Dayummmm I wanna replay. The way she sang those notes!! I need to digest it. Replay!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dayummmmm  https://t.co/UjKrxn0MIE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mmmm  https://t.co/6S41xzDwpd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok...oh OKAYYYYYY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aaand I'm back, with some Lays potato chips, Smart Water AND an Iced Tea...  Next up, #FalseGod<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually no, it's my fault. I knew I shouldn't have listened to it, that it'd break my emotions.  Imma take a brief intermission, chug some cold water, stop crying over my dad, SHAKE IT OFF, get my head back in the game, the here &amp; now, &amp; enjoy this!  Brb.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DAMN   YOU  TAYLOR.  https://t.co/yF086IsrHz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I kept my 😭 in until: "..&amp; I hate to make this all about me But who am I supposed to talk to? What am I supposed to do If there's no you?" ~ That's IT. You don't ever get another f'ng chance. The HURT after losing a parent NEVER goes away. It's unlike other grief; you're STUCK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok... I can do this. If anyone in the whole world understands, it's Taylor.   Here we go<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woooo, I'm NOT prepared to play #SoonYoullGetBetter. Ik it's about @taylorswift13's mama &amp; her battle with cancer. I just lost my daddy to a heart attack 2 months ago &amp; my gma 3 weeks before him; both in my arms, in our house, unexpectedly; coincidentally.  I need to breathe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>..oh boy. I'm NOT prepared to play this next one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait, the official lyrics says "babes, don't threaten me with a good time".  Babes. BABESSSSS. With an S.  Joe calls her BabeSSS. With his sexyass charming english accent?? And she probably teases him back with it??  Excuuuuuse muwahh?!  https://t.co/2UI8tbv6Sy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride       𝔅𝔞𝔟𝔢𝔰, 𝔡𝔬𝔫'𝔱 𝔱𝔥𝔯𝔢𝔞𝔱𝔢𝔫 𝔪𝔢 𝔴𝔦𝔱𝔥 𝔞 𝔤𝔬𝔬𝔡 𝔱𝔦𝔪𝔢 They say home is where the heart is But God, I love the 𝔈𝔫𝔤𝔩𝔦𝔰𝔥                                  🤣😍  Me too. Don't threaten ME with a good time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They say home is where the heart is But that's not where mine lives  You know I love a London boy  https://t.co/cRYuCnwg86<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TayLOR what in the shizniz are you doing to me??  ARGH. I should have known bc you always do this to me but damn.  -  Next up ~ #LondonBoy. Ohhhh, Joeeee. You been on her mindddd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.  https://t.co/BgOn76Mzfm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough But I'll be all right, it's just a thousand cuts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And what once was ours is no one's now I see you everywhere, the only thing we share Is this small town You said it was a great love, one for the ages But if the story's over, why am I still writing pages?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Her voice breaks are PERFECT!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WowowowowowWOW.  Proof that even though it's upbeat, it's powerful as shit! The lyrics, the storytelling, the real in your face rawness of it! This is what it is, as it is... look at it. Here I am, exposed, what I'm dealing with. 🤯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Next up, #DeathByAThousandCuts...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.  https://t.co/54TdC0qWjy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg.. the way her voice softens and slightly breaks...  Barefoot in the kitchen Sacred new beginnings That became my religion, listen  I hope I never lose you I'd never walk Cornelia Street again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends I'd never walk Cornelia Street again That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend I'd never walk Cornelia Street again  SO BITTERSWEET, THIS LOVE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...awwwwwww  https://t.co/dz0bVoT94A<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's listen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, next up! #CorneliaStreet ~ which I KNOW has a lot of meaning in the T/J relationship!  She met him at a dive bar either on or near it, and they went for walks there a lot, &amp; didn't someone stay around there?  I sound stalkerish~I realize this. I don't GO to these places-YET.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings Uh huh, that's right Darling, you're the one I want, and I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this Uh huh, that's right Darling, you're the one I want 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.  https://t.co/9klg7LKu9v<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.  https://t.co/scwCNJUaOF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, ok it's cheerful! Woooo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Next up, #PaperRings  I have a feeling imma cry if she talks about marriage. Joe! What did you pull out of her this time?! BOYYYY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...and now there's more songs... 😭  I'm trying to digest all the feels from that 🔼 one still, and compute how to come down to enjoy the rest.  Ok, deep breath...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>... my brain...   I feel like I just... ok. So somehow I fell into an Alice In Wonderland rabbit hole, discovered the 8th wonder of the world, fell in love, had my 1st orgasm, rode on a magical carousel with the damn Aurora Borealis circling above &amp; returned home safely... HOW?!  https://t.co/0znhKakKGr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My brain:  https://t.co/PMufMlDGdP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like... I cannot get this loud enough... why wont my brain explode?!?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is fucking amazing I'm crying  https://t.co/QSch9WEGPb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You guys KNOWWWWW Reputation is my RELIGION   #MissAmericanaAndTheHeartbreakPrince  Let me... I just...  I have to replay this. I can't move on. I can't. I gotta do it. Replay!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I cant  I literally cannot.  How. 👏 In 👏the 👏hell 👏 HAVE YALL 👏 been letting ME sleep on this?!?!  I thought you guys were my friends. This is unacceptable!!!!  Tagging @SwiftPola @urnotmyhomeland @americavdynasty bc...hello! You are my ride and dies here. Slap me next time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hold up  HOLD UP TAYLOR  [[ PAUSE ]]  https://t.co/4oKZ02DPT8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm getting 50 Shades vibes, where Christian is flying Ana in the plane...  https://t.co/DAqiqCRxNw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuxxxxxx this is an immediate favorite!!! I am getting REPUTATION vibessssssss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn Joe ~ you bring the sexy outta Taylor like no one else I swear boy  https://t.co/mZFjLuKPnQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wasn't ready!!!  https://t.co/THd9iAyXFU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ooooh these V I B E SSSSSSS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Next, is #MissAmericanaAndTheHeartbreakPrince  Which the title alone is giving me feels  I've heard this is about Joe + the Netflix documentary, Miss Americana - insanely epic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that she's showing nods to Justin, whom she loves, and he has a song called #IThinkSheKnows...it's really adorable. I'm fangirling.  https://t.co/jOcYlmkZuS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok I'm already getting JT and MJ vibes off the gate, mixed with some guitar riffs from... somewhere... I'll think of it...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Next, #IThinkHeKnows<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was some damn good, powerful shit! Why don't people talk about it more? I've even seen people DISS it. IDGI. I would rank it with #TheLakes as far as poetry prose and lyrical wordsmith goes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So it's her way of saying, "I've been The Archer" (pointed out good/bad) &amp; "The prey" (loved/attacked) &amp; ppl have mistreated/abandoned her. She's been through hell but it's taught her to grow &amp; through it all, she has her fans &amp; self. Now she's READY.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...wow...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll stay. I love you, I'll stay!! Been here since '06. I'm not going anywhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awww, Taylor... 😭😭😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is heavy 😩😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Next, #TheArcher  I know people said she wrote this for her fans or to her fans, but AGAIN, when she released it as a special drop (NOT a single), I was in a heavy space &amp; didn't want to be sadder...  So I'm curious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Skipping #TheMan for the sake of my listening party, bc I rock out to it a LOT &amp; everyone should know how much I love it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gah. I just love #Lover. Still feel for Taylor and love songs, it didn't get enough recognition- but I'm always going to feel that way. I always want more for her. I want everyone to GET IT. But when a record, esp a single, doesn't explode, I'm like...  https://t.co/x64NR3UBBg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...this is OUR house...                    ...WE make the rules.  I remember getting my first house w/someone and being so excited to say, we're the grownups, we can do whatever, decorate however, make it ours. Holding such wonder in what it would turn out to be... 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God these lyrics This production The timelessness  The vulnerability!  "Can I go where you go? Can we always be this close?"  DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW DEEP SOMEONE HAS TO BE TO FEEL BRAVE ENOUGH TO ASK THOSE QUESTIONS?!?!?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Next, #Lover... oh shit, it's crying time.  https://t.co/kKe2GiRfi4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I love you" - ain't that the worst thing  you ever heard?  UGHH THE VULNERABILITY! #Facts  When you spit that shit out to some1 you ʀ ᴇ ᴀ ʟ ʟ ʏ care for, you just gotta chug some damn Tequila after bc you can't take it back.  Imma scream it like that if I ever say it again.🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wowwwwww this production  https://t.co/TfSsLAH5O6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is such an eargasm explosion...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Next, #CruelSummer...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So... yeah..🤷‍♀️  Cute! 😅 Been there, Taylor. A few times. Men try so hard, wanting you to still give a damn and react to them doing something foolish and you're just like, oh wait, you still around? Dude I forgot you existed. My bad, buddy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awwww all her laughs!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh my gosh this is sooo cute! I like this bop! Smooth and clever. I love how she's speak-singing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, ok Taylor... look at this cleverness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My heart is RACING omg idk what to expect 🤣🤣  Ok ok, 1st song is #IForgotYouExisted. Playing...NOW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For this experience, I've got my wireless bluetooth #Zihnio headphones, @Spotify playlist, which you can stream along with me here:  https://t.co/NFvlw0USif<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sheilavstay I would NOT be able to keep my cool, I know it. I'd like 2pretend I'd be able to, but I couldn't keep my emotions in check.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump If the WORST POSSIBLE THING you have on @SpeakerPelosi is her being set up by hair salon - or even the fact that she DID go in willingly w/o a face mask &amp; got her hair done, well...😶😄🤣🤣. Really? REALLY?? THAT'S what you wanna "send her packing" w/? Oh boy. You are killing me.  https://t.co/MRPe8qe0ni<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sheilavstay Awww, baby sis! She'd totally recognize you! (Between your beauty me beside you hopping up and down like a #madwoman trying to get her attention, it'd be impossible not to notice! 🤣🤣🙈🙈)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Everyone says how sweet I am on here BUT ppl are TESTING ME TODAY. 🤣 I'm teetering that edge. Idk it's the vibes.

<|startoftext|>@goodgirlchrisy @SquireMorgan @kanyewest @NickCannon @Eminem @taylorswift13 Ok... imma have to try it, &amp; will it be ok to DM you if I have a question or get confused? I'll look up some YouTube tutorials first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I GET people care about them as friends &amp; enjoy the possibility of the maybe-idea of them once-being, still-being something more. Ok? But JESUS. They've never confirmed it -they HAVE denied it- &amp; until they WANT you to know more = simply RESPECT them.  No one should have to ask!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're a #LarryStylinson presenting this type of behavior to where you're being annoying/harassing/defensive, you clearly don't respect boundaries/privacy of @Harry_Styles or @Louis_Tomlinson.  That's not being a true fan. That's being fucking psychotic. I suggest counseling.  https://t.co/ghnUXIvfWr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This type of shit PISSES ME OFF as a #HarryStyles fan:  https://t.co/oVfwqKeJ6g  🤬 Seriously?? STOP. You make @Harry_Styles &amp; @Louis_Tomlinson uncomfortable! They don't want this!

<|startoftext|>@goodgirlchrisy @SquireMorgan @kanyewest @NickCannon @Eminem @taylorswift13 But HOW do you save the .mp4? Do you rip the vids from YouTube? I'm so clueless. 🤣🙈  (Like with Sony Vegas, I had a side program called ClipGrab that I'd use. I'd paste the YouTube link into ClipGrab, download &amp; save the video as .mp4, then use the vid in my editing program.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwiftPola Better now that I've seen youuuu  https://t.co/XBkeq7TQ7B<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Trump, the only way your name &amp; "Favorite President" go together 4 the MAJORITY of America in a TRUE sentence is:  @realDonaldTrump is America's Favorite President to laugh at &amp; the biggest fucking joke on the planet-we can't WAIT until you're voted out.

<|startoftext|>@AGoodSoumaritan I'm really excited to be honest. Sometimes when special things come out (like a movie or tv show I know I'll enjoy), I'll hold off on it so I know I'll have something great to look forward to. It's like Christmas in Summer or a BONUS birthday. 🥳<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AGoodSoumaritan I know!! I'm soooo ashamed!! When #Lover came out, I was done w/men at the time (nasty divorce, spew of douchenozzle men) &amp; couldn't get in the 💓 headspace so I put it off. I know the singles &amp; participated as a fan, but never listened to the album. 🙈😭 I suck!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>RECOGNIZE YOUR WHITE PRIVILEGE &amp; CHANNEL IT. Help your friends, neighbors, brothers &amp; sisters. Fight for equality. It MATTERS. We CAN make a difference. It's all about understanding what we can do to help. The time to stand on the sidelines has passed.  BLACK LIVES MATTER.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wanna know ANOTHER reason why I, a white woman, fights 4 #BlackLivesMatter?  •My 7yo son looks up at a cop &amp; his biggest question is, "When will I get to be a cop like him someday?"  •His 7yo classmate looks up at a cop &amp; his biggest question is, "Will I be killed by that cop?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden is a BOSS. 🤣 "DON'T JUMP!"   Gosh, I've missed him &amp; love his humor. Nice to see someone not take the bait &amp; fly off the handle.  Trump would've called in the National Guard, thrown a bitchbaby tantrum about "Presidential Harassment", &amp; went on a 1hr Twitter rant.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bloodyforswift So we all would sit and watch bc that's the ONLY way they'd GUARANTEE an audience tonight - ain't that right, @vmas?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taylorswift13 didn't perform at @MTV @vmas. She won 1🏆out of all noms, which was nice but not what was expected.  Rest of show was too glammed/fake/off; nothing was authentic.  Probably best Taylor didn't perform &amp; associate #Folklore with it. Keeps it 💯 .  YEAH I SAID IT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Weeknd is great   but he won over Em and over Tay? For #VideoOfTheYear? Did the people who vote just not see #Godzilla or #TheMan? Bc...how?  At least turn it into a legit battle between E &amp; T. Those 2 vids smashed records.  Just...really? Nah. Hellll nah.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jpsaxe &amp; @juliamichaels look so fucking beautiful!! This performance, their chemistry, the set... #Fantasy! 👏🥰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FINALLY AN AUTHENTIC MOMENT with @vmas saluting real people. #EverydayHeroes   Aww and @jpsaxe &amp; @juliamichaels singing my song 🥰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Igh the inserted fake sound clips of laughter and cheers are making me want to punch people.  This award show could have been so authentic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'M BORED.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blinding Lights is the shizzzz.  Always #JusticeForBreonnaTaylor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicolerichie ~ girl. 🙏 I know your history. I'm just...concerned. All I'm gonna say about it bc I don't wanna make it sound like shade/shame when it's just noticing and saying hey, I see, i hope you feel better &amp; can get over your struggles again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well take me to church @ladygaga with this twist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...what is happening...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...oh hi @ArianaGrande!!! 👋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ladygaga  Always killing it. +That sea green color on you is everything. And thx for  shout-out to @britneyspears &amp; @NSYNC from 1999. I remember that performance vividly. They owned the show every damn year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOUDER VIOLA DAVIS!!! YASSSSSS.  #IMWORTHIT @violadavis IS A LEGEND.  Wish it wasn't a @LOrealParisUSA ad (though I like their products) that was used to get the message across but whatever works. Message received. Love Viola.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is @madisonbeer at the @MTV @vmas? Hasn't she been cancelled a billion times for doing stupid shit &amp; never learning her lesson? Being fake af? Autotune? Constant lying? Cruel?  ...Not a big fan of ppl who don't earn their careers or purpose, but don't mind me. Moving on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okkk the #BTS guys are pretty cheeky and the song is catchy! I love their style and synchronicity. I feel like the performance is very #LaLaLand meets #TheGreatGatsby. Cute! (Men, take notes on their style. 🔥)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok first time I'm EVER witnessing ANYTHING #BTS related. EVER.  Gonnaa see what this is all about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gaga &amp; Ariana are both Queens  but HOW did they win over Billie &amp; MtS when their 2 songs (Savage &amp; Everything I Ever Wanted) were literally everywhere?  I'm confuzzled. Bo shade, just confusion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I heard "Watermelon Sugar" &amp; flew out of my chair  But then it was Joey King that came out, &amp; not Harry. 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LOUlSVAULT Watermelon Sugar in a hurry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@popculturebaby @vmas @taylorswift13 Sure! I'm on it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This award show feels OFF.  Like I'm beyond happy about seeing @taylorswift13 bc she makes me feel better but everything feels OFF and awkward and forced.  I know the show must go on though.   2020. Fuck you very, very much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Idk who this singer is, so while the latin melody is pretty, I'm just gonna close my eyes and go back to thinking about how pretty @taylorswift13 looked accepting her award... those blue eyes and those curls... such a fucking fairytale princess. 🥰👏🥂🎉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cmariexo_ @MTV @vmas THEY DO LOOK ANIMATED JUST NOW  I am 💀💀💀💀💀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vmas @taylornation13 @taylorswift13 Yassss Queen, keep SLAYING and taking names! Teach us there are no limits! #AchievementUnlocked 🏆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@popculturebaby @vmas @taylorswift13 You're good!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cmariexo_ @MTV @vmas Are they animated?? Omg please tell me they're animated that will be EPIC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taylorswift13 wins #TheMan for #BestDirection   Deserved!! Proud of my girl. She owned that song, video, everything. LITERALLY. She can (&amp; did) it all! What else can I say?? 👑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miley  I love this song sfm (shoutout to @StevieNicks influence bigtime) but I just don't get the hair, I'm sorry. No shade do your thing but I don't get it. Great fucking song though. I can relate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1st    https://t.co/0wORy5Il3p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm just gonna make this my official @MTV @vmas opinions thread...to discuss everything unrelated to @taylorswift13.  Kthx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eeespicy @MTV Here's one:   https://t.co/drBs33uEhB  If that doesn't work ~ Just search "VMA Stream Link" on Twitter. That's what I did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eeespicy @MTV I'm just watching on my TV. Let me see if I can find stream links for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*The audience I see is when she's hosting. They were perched on small balconies to the left and right. Barely noticible.  But the SOUND CLIPS were still used bc that group could not. And then sound clips after performances. 🤣🤣🤣  @MTV @vmas is already REACHING hot mess levels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh wait... I see a small audience on each of the sides.   Are they not wearing masks? They're just packed willynilly?  This makes no sense. How is this safe? Ugh. COVID IS REAL. Award shows or not.  Did they have to sign a "Do not sue @MTV if you die?" release?🙈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Soooo is there actually an audience or are they using a bunch of sound clips? Bc, OBVIOUSLY SOUND CLIPS.  Why can't they be more real??  #MTVVMAs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...but ultimately, it came down to Taylor.  And Taylor reigns supreme.  So my stance tonight is: #HereForTaylor #HarryDeservesMore #MTVDoBetter #TeamAugust<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rumor has it, @Harry_Styles is #boycotting the @vmas bc @MTV didn't nominate him in ANY solid categories-which is a goddamn shame!!-&amp; if he does, I don't blame him. MTV needs to get straight on that shit. #HarryDeservesMore  So yeah, I was torn on watching.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I haven't actually sat down to watch the @vmas since I was a teenager. Not to expose myself, but let's just say that's been a loooong while. (We have the internet now &amp; we can YT shit after.)  But @taylorswift13 has lit a match so I'm here for HER this year. 🤗<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HaranguingE @AllTooWeston @goodnightmiguel @maniIore I keep telling myself and everyone I come across, this too shall pass.   I've done through a lot, and idk your personal life, but the best advice I like to spread is, we've made it through every hard day of our lives. We'll keep making it.  All the best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HaranguingE @AllTooWeston @goodnightmiguel @maniIore ... it's ok.  Things are crazy rn, but I'm a bleeding heart &amp; open mind. Sorry you're going through the ringer where you are. I hate war, period &amp; senseless riots for the record). We all have feelings &amp; diff backgrounds. Everything is backwards &amp; scary. I pray for peace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HaranguingE @AllTooWeston @goodnightmiguel @maniIore Eeesh, you're one of those.

<|startoftext|>Gosh. This looks like so much fun. In a perfect world, I wanna get my #Swifties together once Covid is over and have one helluva singalong #TaylorSwift party! 🥂🎉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllTooWeston @HaranguingE @goodnightmiguel @maniIore To be honest, somedays I'd give ANYTHING to go back to being naive or "out of the loop" with politics. I don't fault you for falling back! I try all the time to, but as an advocate/activist, I'm in too deep. Daily, I wake up with DREAD &amp; fear. &amp; for fucksake I miss Obama. 😭<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@maniIore Yes... it would be DEVASTATING, like the sudden betrayal of my best friend. I'd never be able to look at or respect her the same way again. 14 years of worship down the same. It would KILL me to listen to her songs. God I can't think about it. 🥺😭💔  THANK GOD SHE HATES HIM!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chadwickboseman [3] I allowed him to ask questions &amp; maintain his nativity while also open it gently.

<|startoftext|>@chadwickboseman [2] ..? Why was he crying, Mama?" I realized as a mama maybe didn't do the right thing avoiding discussing race issues.

<|startoftext|>@chadwickboseman Dear Chad My 7yo son is white &amp; his classmate, D, black. He &amp; I don't discuss race often bc I try to preach humans=colorblind/we all bleed red.

<|startoftext|>@taysticals I want to wear his initial on a chain round my neck Chain round my neck Not because he owns me But 'cause he really knows me Which is more than they can say, I I recall late November, holding my breath Slowly I said, "You don't need to save me... But would #you run away with me?"  https://t.co/xOZxQL0rdP<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@maftuna_1304 @riya_ku12 🤣 yeah a few people were like,      "wait... that you, Ang? You went STAN!"  Idk if I'll stay full on stan mode, I'll probably find some way to incorporate the both better next time, but it's fun for now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Saylorrtwiftt @lingerlikeakiss @ntltcswift @wisteriagrow13 Cool!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since I recently changed my usual personal Twitter layout to stan #TaylorSwift &amp; #HarryStyles mode &amp; have a bunch of new followers, I thought I'd do a quick #FaceReveal to y'all.

<|startoftext|>@riya_ku12 @jk_rowling 🤣 I didn't want to use the hashtag at first but it was the only way to clearly make my point (&amp; thankfully most in trend are doing same).  Have you read her statement? Her trying 2 justify her actions? Her unnamed sources reminds me of @realDonaldTrump BS. I about reacted like:  https://t.co/7dig8ZbQdb<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@exiIestyles I go back to this on YT all the damn time and lately when people ask me what my favorite song is, I'm like, well...it's complicated!  Which is ALSO why I changed my tagline to "falling for folklore" &amp; my twitter layout was bc if this damn mashup 🤣🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@stillabeliever2 @taylorswift13 #Mirrorball is underrated and under-hyped! There's some sensational double entendres written in there. Taylor is a craftsman lyricist and ringmaster within her delivery on it. I mean, it's her STORY-her love AND fears as a performer!  People better stop sleeping on it!!  https://t.co/pFh69Olvvf<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Honorable Mention #2:  Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honorable Mention #1:  I struck a match and blew your mind But I didn't mean it And you didn't see it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CLManussier 👍 Well ok then. I'll get right on doing both those things. The staff here take suggestions of reporting and demands to chill due to your own discomfort of my tweet very seriously.  Btw~I love your profile pic's message! It's quite poetic, especially in times like now.  https://t.co/M6d2kHtQMJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...sure is amazing seeing how quickly A FEW on your own "team" attacks you, makes assumptions/nonsense, simply bc you choose to use your voice &amp; speak up to defend a CHILD who JUST SO HAPPENS 2B a Trump. 🤣  Sure, Jans. I'm #NotSorry - just a human who gives a damn.🤷‍♀️  Carry on!  https://t.co/XBvoXFCqFJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@susanmathai @BarackObama Well then you'd think since you're more educated &amp; experienced in this field of our democracy &amp; what we stand for and fight for (&amp; against), you'd be...well...MORE on the same page w/me?  Less quick to jump on the attack wagon simply bc I defended a KID who happens to be Trump's.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For those saying "it's only his height!" - y'all ain't on the same Twitter or looking deep enough.  For those blasting me for speaking up on the same issues WE as Dems fight for regarding kids - WTF?🤨 Greta? Chelsea? Sasha/Malia? Ring bells?  Am I living in a parallel universe?  https://t.co/mgVQx9mRa2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CLManussier There's a difference between "fangirling" &amp; ...well...how to put this politically correct?  ...I can't.  &amp; I don't want to screencap things &amp; spread the nastiness just to prove it exists.  But what some are saying is sick &amp; twisted &amp; if it were MY son - mama bear would rip 🤬 up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>MY TRUTH: •Registered Dem since '01.🌊 •Worked both @BarackObama campaigns &amp; have the HONOR of his follow. •Known Advocacy that speaks for itself on here •I USE MY VOICE for ANY abuse regardless of sides bc wrong is wrong •Get your facts before you assume/try me.  Thanks!🥂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@susanmathai Honey check my feed before EVER assuming I of all people am a Trump supporter. I've worked both @BarackObama campaigns &amp; have the honor of his follow. I'm a die-hard Dem since '01. I advocate &amp; fight 4 change DAILY.  As a Dem &amp; Obama lover, I know by HIS example right from wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CLManussier I didn't even make it 3 minutes into clicking on his name in the trending topics before stumbling on at least 10 posts discussing how "sexy" he is/will be &amp; girls commenting things I won't repeat. Trust me, it's happening &amp; it's SICK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Attacking 14yo Barron Trump because of his father's bullshit? Wrong.  Discussing 14yo Barron Trump's "good looks" -or- daring to sexualize him (as teens are doing on here!)? Wrong.  Y'all wtf. Be BETTER. I'm a Dem but also a mother &amp; this innocent boy is a baby so pls just STOP.  https://t.co/N6ZpkirUiJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thejtlewis As a dedicated Democrat, I agree with @thejtlewis. Idk what's being said about Barron but no one should go after an innocent child who is put in this political spotlight, and anyone doing this outta be ashamed bc you damn well know better. He is a young kid; he is NOT his father.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can someone please respectfully remind @eltonofficial that @taylorswift13 exists?   BC after the Ivanka Trump/RNC/Elton John bullshit today, as much as I respect &amp; have grown up &amp; continue to listen to EJ's music, I'm having issues with my limits on kindness right now.

<|startoftext|>The REASON is I had to order all 3 today (&amp; each separate transactions) bc of @CapitalOne &amp; @taylorswift13's guidelines, so they're delivering here &amp; then I'll have re-send them to each of the winners on MY dime for shipping &amp; it's so pricey shipping overseas every time. 😭💔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lifeinswift Thank you.  I do what I can bc it's 2020 &amp; : • 1 in every 3 women &amp; 1 in 70 men are raped annually • 8/10 rapes are by someone the victim knows • 80% of rapists reoffend • Only 20% get reported AND for every 1000 reported, only FIVE get punished. • #RapeCulture. Look it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sheilavstay Oh man, I've been there! That is the WORST, most aggravating! It's only become more unbearable since Covid. You just wanna reach through the phone and shake people!  https://t.co/jaW5SpO4e4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@myelegies Thanks hon. *hugs* As I grew to understand &amp; accept what happened, went to therapy &amp; just sat w/it &amp; reflected, I realized sharing my story could help others-that's all I wanted &amp; needed when I was going through it myself:to not feel alone, bc it gets dark.  Why I'm an #advocate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, I'm here for you. I know what it feels like and you are not alone. It took me years to grasp. To seek answers. To say "rape". To feel unashamed &amp; understand what happened. PTSD is HELL &amp; triggers are real. The bnf questioning, shame spiral, guilt, confusion. You'll be OK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If anyone is struggling with a issue of #rape, I invite you to seek resources. @RAINN was my saving grace (&amp; still is).   You're not alone. Confidential help is available for free.  National Sexual Assault Hotline Call 1-800-656-4673<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>His name is JONATHAN EDWARD DANIELS and he was my RAPIST on Nov 5, 2004.  I am a more than a victim &amp; he did not win. I say survivor because I AM one. I made it through. PTSD doesn't own me. He tried but couldn't ruin me. Saying just an initial is being too kind &amp; he took ENOUGH.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@urnotmyhomeland Aww! I used to think he was such a dork &amp; never paid him any attention back in HSM days &amp; then I saw him on something 1 day...oh! Ellen w/Taylor (ofc) &amp; I was like ok he's not a kid anymore! Then #TheLuckyOne came &amp; I was like DAYUM. Now I like a lot of his movies &amp; he's hot af!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sheilavstay @NiallOfficial @taylorswift13 @Harry_Styles @NiallOfficial seems quite shy and humble, but let me tell you, in THAT moment, with THAT song, the way he captured the audience - he knows what he's doing. It felt like puppy love. 🤣 That's what I was saying above when I said I felt like he was serenading ME. He's THAT GOOD. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sheilavstay @NiallOfficial @taylorswift13 @Harry_Styles ...and he was soooo mesmerizing I was stuck in a haze of like direct eye contact &amp; hand holding &amp; singing, lost in space &amp; time. Snapped like 1 photo I think. 🤣 Too in the moment. He had me so overcome by him! I can't describe the moment! Like seeing a crush for the 1st time! 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sheilavstay @NiallOfficial @taylorswift13 @Harry_Styles He did, a few diff times! My fav was during #TooMuchToAsk. Randomly sat down guitar &amp; came off stage to the front &amp; middle of front rows where I was &amp; let crowd sing for him. Stopped dead in front of me-I could have stroked his face-&amp; held my hand as we all sang. I teared up!! 🥺<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@battletested5 I can't watch it. I can't tolerate any Republican news fuckery. Bless you &amp; your brain for trying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sheilavstay @NiallOfficial @taylorswift13 @Harry_Styles @NiallOfficial did a great job! Extremely charismatic on stage. Girls of all ages were going crazy &amp; men were rooting for him! He can PLAY that damn guitar &amp; sing his face off. He had ME tear up, especially when he kept holding my hand. Great memories! 10/10 recommend!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zaynssmileeeee @drewforeverboy Haha! I'm forever proud (&amp; stubborn)~I won't settle til he reaches the TOP everywhere &amp; critics/awards see it. Relieved #WatermelonSugar reached the top, but #Kiwi deserved #1. So did #AdoreYou, #LightsUp, #Falling, &amp; #SignOfTheTimes! His timeless expression music bends genres!🤩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zaynssmileeeee @drewforeverboy He is! But still UNDERRATED &amp; it pisses me off. @Harry_Styles deserves more recognition outside the fandom &amp; pop world.

<|startoftext|>🙈CONFESSION: I've never fully listened to #Lover. When it dropped, I was too busy in my life, felt I wouldn't be able to relate to lovey songs bc of personal issues, &amp; distracted. +I was bitter over #Reputation's treatment. Only album I didn't give fair chance to.☹  STONE ME,k?  https://t.co/v3Lbhu6Ckt<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>FYI: I'm a pt-time fan account. Yes I gush about her/them/shows/things &amp; have days of obsession/escapism. 🤣 I host #giveaways &amp; interact w/fandoms.   I ALSO discuss writing, politics, dreams, thoughts, opinions, life, giggles, jokes.  I'm a mix of confetti, lyrics &amp; bluster. 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Usually character's names come to me immediately-like meeting some1 IRL:They greet you &amp; say, "Hello, my name's X &amp; here's part of my story..."-esp when there's a person I "see" as visual/story inspo.  This time, THIS character - nope. She's STUBBORN. #AmWriting #WritingCommunity  https://t.co/H2jVhlERwY<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@swiftiealways26 Wow, really?? That just made my night!   I was just needing somewhere to express my thoughts (bc these characters are currently OVERCROWDING it!) &amp; hoped someone would see it but never truly thought anyone cared!! 🥺🤗  https://t.co/4ZAQktnAZM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sheilavstay #Ghost is such a classic! Timeless, beautiful, tragic. I hope you loved it!   I need to rewatch it. It's been awhile!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Being a #writer is tiring. It's hard. #WritersBlock is a son of a bitch-I know, I've gone years at times. You MISS it when it's gone like you would an arm or something-#PhantomLimb syndrome.  But when it comes back to you... When you get THAT feeling again... Damn. It's great.🥰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I cannot find the words to ever fully describe the #writingprocess, esp when inspiration hits. Kinda reminds me of the movie #Ghost. 🤣 When Whoopie is running from Patrick but can't escape bc he won't shut up &amp; it's her job. You just have to let him come in &amp; take the ride!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...to maintain a sense of normalcy &amp; balance YOUR life AND feed into your passion &amp; curiosity, which is listening to these characters &amp; seeing where they're taking you bc it's beyond YOU.  You're truly living in multiple universes, existing in 2 places at once.  Such a high. 🥺🥰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...completely overtaken by THEIR story. They need to tell you all about it &amp; they need to tell you NOW. You're simply a messenger, trying to decipher info &amp; navigate pieces &amp; fill in blanks, &amp; they don't slow down or shut up for NOTHING.  So then you're trying...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thing about #writing is, when characters come to you, they hit out of NOWHERE.  It's like you're you, living YOUR normal life, then BAM! -this semi strikes from nowhere &amp; your brain is flooded &amp; voices come screaming &amp; a parallel universe presents before you &amp; you're...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Too many times, I have wondered: "What r we trying this for?" You come around, I feel so down, I'm gonna drown bc Ik that you've fallen short. But do you know it doesn't change the way I feel about you at the end of the day? BC I know that #AllIWant is... what you got. ~@SusieSuh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You say you 'wander your own land', but when I think about it, I don't see how you can? You're aching, you're breaking, and I can see the pain in your eyes... it says: "Everybody's changing, and I don't know why". ~@keaneofficial #EverybodysChanging<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel I wanna hold you, wanna tell you that you'll be alright. I'm helpless, it's gonna get us before we get this, I wanna kiss you goodbye. ...I...I miss you now. I...#IMissYouNow. ~@stereophonics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...maybe tomorrow            I'll find my way home. ~@stereophonics #MaybeTomorrow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I won't ALWAYS love what I'll never have-I won't ALWAYS live in my regrets. You'll sit alone forever if you wait for the right time. What are you hoping for? I'm here, I'm now, I'm ready Holding on tight. Don't give away the end, The one thing that stays MINE. ~@jimmyeatworld #23<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I felt for sure last night That once we said goodbye, No one else will know these lonely dreams ~@jimmyeatworld #23<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God pls dont tell me this has been in vain I need answers for what all the waiting I've done means You #kill me-you've got some nerve but cant face your mistakes Ik what I should do but I just cant turn away So go on love Leave while there's still hope for escape ~@jimmyeatworld<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Driving away from the wreck of the day, and I'm thinking 'bout calling on Jesus. 'Cause love doesn't hurt, so I know I'm not falling in love, I'm just falling to pieces. And if this is giving up, ...then I'm giving up. ~@Anna_Nalick #WreckOfTheDay<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_blaque_fantasy just tweeted her entire journey into becoming a new #Swiftie and listening to @taylorswift13's records, and y'all...she's entertaining af!!! I'm DEAD in an epic way, reliving this magic!!!   WELCOME TO THE TEAM!! 👏  GO check her tweets! You won't regret! 🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@swiftietsblog  https://t.co/NkLj6PJqEi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sheilavstay Yeah. She effed up bad. Her loss! Ha!  He dated @FKAtwigs for quite a long while... 2.5 years, I think? They split amicably.  He's been w/@sukiwaterhouse since June or July of 2018 and seems so, so happy (&amp; at peace).  He keeps his relationships more private since KS.  https://t.co/K92fnXmCUn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sheilavstay I did until the day she cheated on him &amp; those pics leaked of her w/Rupert. From that day on, my ENTIRE perspective of her flipped. I TRIED to respect her for Bella &amp; bc HE forgave her, but couldn't get past. NO ONE hurts Rob. He WORSHIPPED her &amp; she pulled that selfish bs? NOPE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@swiftietsblog Yes please do!! His roles are so unique!! I love how he picks them. They're both incredible and you'll see a completely different range from him that you won't know what hit you!! Every new movie he does from the last, his acting talent grows immensely. He's a chameleon! 🦎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@swiftietsblog SAME! I remember when script leaked online cpl nights before. I stayed up w/my editor @CCB317 &amp; read it together &amp; BAWLED all night bc if came outta nowhere. We lived in diff states &amp; knew what was gonna happen so after we left 📽 we checked in on e/o bc we couldn't deal! 😭💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@swiftietsblog I'm...not in my teens...by a long shot 🤣🤣🤣 but I have no shame for the love &amp; admiration for him. He is a fine wine. If you haven't seen #RememberMe, #Cosmopolis, #WaterForElephants, #GoodTime, &amp; #TheLighthouse (to name a few) I highly recommend!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sheilavstay  https://t.co/eh1009cLQG<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sheilavstay Haha yup! I read the books wayyy before &amp; was online the day he was announced as cast &amp; nearly had a damn heart attack bc he was PERFECT. Exactly how I imagined only better. I cried bc I couldn't get the "face" right until I saw him &amp; just KNEW I was in LOVE!  I mean... 🥺🥺😭😭  https://t.co/hJX1R1uWG9<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ineedyaataylor @iamsrk Ok! Which song?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sheilavstay @Harry_Styles Jesus Christ he DOES   NOW I GET IT  I totally wanna cry.  I need to relisten to that song &amp; just stare at the .gif I posted. 🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sheilavstay Both great. #Falling is EVERYTHING. 🥺🥺 I CANNOT with that song.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@myelegies Yeah, they were "young" for me &amp; I was busy when they were coming up  so I sort of didn't pay attention &amp; dismissed them. Some songs on the radio were too kids bop but others were catchy/good. Always adored Harry but didn't know him well then &amp; didn't give him credit bc 1D.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sheilavstay Do you have a favorite 1D'er &amp; songs?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ineedyaataylor @iamsrk Idk ANYTHING about Bollywood (it's not around/discussed in my life), but my friends who are into musicals love it so it intrigues me bc they're into it. Maybe one day I'll have time to look into musicals &amp; expand from there...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tayllicitaffair ARE WE TWINS FOR REAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For me: @Harry_Styles. Cannot BELIEVE I went this damn long w/o knowing this man's solo music, intelligence, art, humor, entertainment, fashion, kindness, fan interactions, talents, swagger, humility~list goes on.

<|startoftext|>Oh... forgot 2 things:  - what do #HarryStyles fans call themselves in the fandom world? (Should probably go ahead and learn that now. 🤣)  - Who ELSE LOVES HARRY?? We need to be best buds so I can discuss this new obsession with you. Stat.  https://t.co/B2kLsVymeG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quickly, Yk how a few days ago, I said I was a new-er fan of @Harry_Styles &amp; was discovering his solo music? Yeah...I've deep-dived into nothing but HS vids on YT since then.

<|startoftext|>@swiftieinak @runninglkewater ..omg I got overly excited too fast. I saw the colors and immediately thought PARROT.  then I re-read your tweet, and realized you wrote "small bird"  ...she may not even be a parrot...   I need to calm down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@winedrunktaylor @billieeilish Seems like she has quite an eclectic range w musical influences. I haven't heard her speak much about him or Biebs lately. More Beatles &amp; Sinatra, Claudio &amp; Tyler TC, Bon Iver, etc. I think she has PLENTY of other BETTER inspos she doesn't name that Finn does when they write. ❤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@swiftieinak @runninglkewater I am obsessed with birds. 😭 And you named her Margarita?? 😭😭  You are the COOLEST.  Makes me miss my old birds I grew up with, Polly (Mini-Macaw) &amp; George (African Grey).   What type of parrot is Margarita? Does she speak much??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@itsTaymericana @runninglkewater Awww!  Ok, wait wait So her name is "Nox" &amp; she's 4yo But she's ONLY 4lbs??

<|startoftext|>@Crocodile_Lyle Aww look, I hit a nerve. 🤣 IT REALLY IS THAT EASY. You're welcome.  PS, there there sensitive one ~ it didn't say "gaming" when it was 1st trending then.

<|startoftext|>See "HE FINALLY DID IT" trending so I cannonball in wondering:  •What'd #BunkerBitch do now that could top all his other BS?  •Did #Diddy admit that he's the one that put out the hit for @2PAC?  •WHAT MAN, WHAT?!  ⏩ turns out it's about guy, a game contest &amp; he's a hot dog.  https://t.co/U4iSdS6r8A<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Another example: This time #VelvetGiveaways / @velvetgiveaways is taking advantage of a #Swiftie follower of mine @sadproseandhues &gt;&gt;  Link:  https://t.co/8rzEaokfgX  Also tagging @taylornation13 bc this is ridiculous &amp; I want Velvet to be reported for scamming/spamming:  https://t.co/8JPtUiIF1a<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's an example of #VelvetGiveaways BS. Hashtagging it in case @velvetgiveaways blocks my @'s.   https://t.co/uQUcs7KRsy  Link courtesy of @troyesdelicate  https://t.co/FgqhX20aYi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>✋🛑  IMPORTANT PSA ABOUT #GIVEAWAYS...  &lt;Part Six&gt; &lt;cont from two&gt;  I'm BEGGING you. RT my posts about @velvetgiveaways &amp; similar accounts. Spread the word. Tell your friends. Don't let ppl get scammed OR scammers get away w/BS. It isn't right!  STAY SAFE. 🙏 Love y'all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>✋🛑  IMPORTANT PSA ABOUT #GIVEAWAYS...  &lt;Part Five&gt; &lt;cont from two&gt;  What sucks is, accounts like @velvetgiveaways &amp; others give LEGITIMATE #Giveaways a bad rep. Once a fanbase gets scorned, they're scorned - so don't let that be us. Don't be fooled by fake stuff. REPORT FAKES!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>✋🛑  IMPORTANT PSA ABOUT #GIVEAWAYS...  &lt;Part Four&gt; &lt;cont from two&gt;  ...purposely spam others in a fanbase so that they'll gain more followers on their account. They DM you so they won't get flagged themselves for spamming. They're intentionally misleading &amp; using you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>✋🛑  IMPORTANT PSA ABOUT #GIVEAWAYS...  &lt;Part Three&gt; &lt;cont from two&gt;  I've seen too many ppl fall for this gimmick as of late &amp; it's frustrating as hell. All #Giveaways are chance but ones like @velvetgiveaways are TAKING ADVANTAGE of you &amp; your time! They WANT you to...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>✋🛑  IMPORTANT PSA ABOUT #GIVEAWAYS...  &lt;Part Two&gt;  HOWEVER! If you're participating in a #Giveaway that is DMing &amp; asking YOU to RT about it HUNDREDS of times in order to be considered, it's 99.9% likely to be a SCAM for followers. Please do NOT fall for it!! Be smart &amp; safe!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>✋🛑  IMPORTANT PSA ABOUT #GIVEAWAYS...  &lt;Part One&gt;  I don't mind being tagged for other people's #giveaways at all! You don't have to message me beforehand to do so, though I appreciate the ask. As a #Swiftie, I like participating in some that I can't afford, are rare, etx!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She'd rather be w him as long as humanly possible, whether it be only a few seconds or a lifetime. She jumped back in, threw her life away &amp; took the chance.  - Rose!

<|startoftext|>* #35 error -  omg. I just realized I wrote "child labor"!!  *slaps forehead*  1st, I was gonna say "labor" Then, I was gonna say "child birth" ...&amp; wires in my brain crossed and somehow I wrote "child labor".  No. I've never performed child labor. Nor am I a child.  Brb...😭💔  https://t.co/Pqm6VwQv43<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>36. I took 2 years of #Spanish and still remember the basics; need a refresher course though. Also know basics of #ASL (American Sign Language).   I'm interested in #French possibly, and I would LOVE to learn #Latin!  ...can't roll my R's to save my life though. 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>35. I was in child labor for FOUR ENTIRE DAYS!! Yup, no exaggeration. My son came EARLY @ just 27 weeks. Tried to keep him in as long as possible so lungs could develop. Dilated to 10 several times, no meds, over &amp; over. Traumatic af. Spent 8+ months in #NICU. He's my miracle!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Like to say I wouldn't get starstruck; that I'd be cool/normal, speak using coherent, complete sentences...  However!

<|startoftext|>32. One thing I use everyday that I probably couldn't live without would be a pen &amp; paper. Yes, it's basic but true. I'm a writer, so ideas/plots/characters always come to me.

<|startoftext|>27. I have a bad habit of not finishing tv shows that are done filming that I love because then it'll be OVER-over, for good, &amp; not having anything else to look forward to with the characters is too damn depressing.   PLUS, what if my expectations aren't met?? I HATE that!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>23. I spend way too much $$ on pens, notepads, journals and books. I can't resist buying them even if I have unused ones.

<|startoftext|>16. My go-to "happy place" when anxiety or whatnot kicks in is the ocean. One of my tattoos is a wave, and beneath that, I have the word "courage". Has a double meaning - have courage beneath pressure or go to my happy place.😊 I put it on my arm so I could find it quickly.  https://t.co/Ua52Sr5X0Q<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>11. September 11, 2001... 9/11 was  when I became #woke as an Activist &amp; Democrat. I was a kid-young, naive. Didn't know "terrorists" were real-didn't think "war" existed anymore.

(Also in pasta, on chicken, with rice, in stir fry, with seafood, on cottage cheese, tossed in with a salad, you name it - I'll probably try it!) #TeamPineapple  https://t.co/czXDz5vQtg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5. I have this random fear of butterflies landing on me. I know, I know. Just...bare with me. 🤣  I love them. They're gorgeous - but too tiny &amp; fragile! I get anxious &amp; panic bc I'm afraid if I even BREATHE I'll hurt it. When they land on me I actually cry. 😭 I'm too sensitive!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4. I chose to name my son "Weston Dean" because I was obsessed with the show @cw_spn, it's creator @therealKripke, goddess screenwriter herself @serathegamble &amp; of course the one &amp; only Mr. @JensenAckles.   They're my idols, muses, motivation, &amp; inspiration for my dream jobs. 💛<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3. When I was in high school, I graduated with a 2.8 GPA. Unless it was an English class, I couldn't be bothered. 🤷‍♀️  Now, I have 3 degrees (so far!) - 2 Bachelor's, 1 Associate's - and a 4.2 GPA. I'm a gigantic nerd (who still loves English &amp; hates Math/Science). 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2. I've been an extra/actress on many TV shows and movies, including #OneTreeHill, #DawsonsCreek, @NicholasSparks's  #NightsInRodanthe &amp; #TheChoice, etc. My favorite actresses I've ever worked beside are @SophiaBush &amp; @HilarieBurton! Best 4+ years of my life!  https://t.co/LPlZujwBT6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1. My two favorite colors are red and blue. (Something about Intense Passion &amp; Cooling Calm.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm in the mood for a #Challenge, so my friends &amp; followers can get to know me better!  For every LIKE this tweet gets, I will give a #RandomFact about myself!   Let's go! #GetToKnowMe 😃✌  https://t.co/uLK0Ebl73p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>... also wondering... has @Harry_Styles written any songs about @taylorswift13?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I also live 4 his fan interactive. Like @taylorswift13, @Harry_Styles is so sweet 2 his fans!! Never seen a bad interaction. No 1 has a bad thing to say. Seen COUNTLESS videos meeting fans &amp; always go above &amp; beyond, so patient, loving, silly, affectionate. 10s across the board!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love that @Harry_Styles doesn't define his sexuality either, nor does he play into media scrutiny to do so! He genuinely doesn't care what people says. He loves people! His songs usually say "you/someone" instead of "she/he". Love that sfm! Brave, smart &amp; kind!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I 💛 that @Harry_Styles is always inventive. He knows he could pull the ultimate rockstar sex symbol card; he has the full package, the works - but he DOESN'T! He stays unique. He thinks out of the box &amp; doesn't sell out. Isn't in it for fame, you can tell he LOVES it! Admirable!  https://t.co/o9ZCWWNKxP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And #Kiwi - I am OBSESSED!!   Let me tell you... everything about Kiwi and @Harry_Styles is PERFECTION!! From the melody, production, rhythm, kick drum, his voice, everything... sex &amp; swag. This song SLAYED &amp; SOLIDIFIED! It's fun! Sexy! Thrilling! Rock! Pop! Groove! Exciting! 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I first heard #SignOfTheTimes I bawled like a baby. Powerful song. Perfect for @Harry_Styles. So relieved he picked the "scenic route" in music &amp; didn't go for a generic pop song for 1st single. Really showed his range and set him apart as a solo artist. Made him special!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guess I should also confess I was never big on 1D... go ahead &amp; get that out of the way now. I know some of their songs. 🙈  But I've ALWAYS been intrigued by Harry &amp; knew he was going to be the breakout star! Always thought he was handsome, charming, lovely, sweet, &amp; talented!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AdoreYou by @Harry_Styles is such a great song. He's incredibly talented...&amp; that VOICE. I MEAN-🥰  I only really know that, #Kiwi, &amp; #SignOfTheTimes. They're all great!  As a NEW Styles fan (*gasp*), what other songs of his are MUST HAVES??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realveronicaaa You should take it as a compliment That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk You should think about the consequence Of your magnetic field being a little too strong  #Gorgeous<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@amyrenae2005 Omg I would be so mad!!  No one will ever replace Rob for me, personally. Jamie is cool, everybody else is cool, but no one holds a candle to RP. 🤣  Yes I can't wait for Netflix to have #Devil. Ha e you seen the lighthouse yet? So good!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@urnotmyhomeland My name is whatever you decide &amp; I'm just gonna call you mine. I'm insane but I'm your baby. Echoes of your name inside my mind. Halo, hiding my obsession. I once was poison ivy but now I'm your daisy. &amp; baby for you, I would fall from grace Just to touch your face. #DontBlameMe  https://t.co/fyUCDXHwcQ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lifeinswift I, I loved you in spite of Deep fears that the world would divide us So, baby, can we dance Oh, through an avalanche? And say, say that we got it I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted Oh, 'cause it's gravity Oh, keeping you with me  #DancingWithOurHandsTied<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maftuna_1304 Take me to the lakes, where all the poets went to die I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry I'm setting off, but not without my muse  #TheLakes  🌊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@supportvalena We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January This is our place, we make the rules And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?  #Lover 💋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adhissryaa13 And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did I've been spending the last eight months Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it #BeginAgain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@urnotmyhomeland @taylorswift13 I believe music shows someone who another truly is. Secrets, fears, desires, everything!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@americavdynasty As are you! ...btw how did you do this??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@urnotmyhomeland @taylorswift13 We must share one day soon! Can't wait to see what we have in common and explore more music &amp;&amp; get to know more about your soul through your musical choices!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amyrenae2005 That's all that matters! And if I wrote A without backing off &amp; gave her more layers (&amp; backbone), I think more ppl would see her how I did in my head. She was loyal &amp; in love w him to a fault. Dedicated like a demon to Lucifer - he did wrong yet she saw past it, but WHY?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@urnotmyhomeland @taylorswift13 Yessss! I KNEW you'd live &amp; appreciate it!  I am a freaking song thesaurus. Like a Library of Congress. Music is my life. I could recommend soooo many songs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amyrenae2005 The names are different for the novel of course.  For "E", Rob will ALWAYS be my 1st pick. He just IS my guy.   I've also looked for inspiration at actors/characters like/played by Sebastian Stan, Ed Westwick, Tom Ellis, Jeffrey D. Morgan...that mix of ego, swag, love, hate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amyrenae2005 Most have been bc the original photo hosting sites were shut down. I might have some still. I know I have a Pinterest board for new inspiration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amyrenae2005 I wish I'd have had the courage to go with my gut and guns. I was younger then. Now, with the revamp, I want to extend it and go deeper... but then I worry if I do, will people be pissed it's not the same as the original, even if outcome for E/B characters is same?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amyrenae2005 ...I think writing FF, I was too afraid of letting the audience down by going there at the time. Afraid it'd be "too much" &amp; turn ppl away. So I have a LOT of regrets about my writing with TEF w/a lot of the character arcs. You see me almost going there &amp; backing down often!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amyrenae2005 Tysm! I purposely wrote it like a show bc being a screenwriter is equally my dream! So happy you saw that!  I WISH I dove deeper into E/A like I wanted. I've been A in that situation &amp; w/the book I plan to explore that emotionally. So much left to say!...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@urnotmyhomeland @taylorswift13 Yes @taylorswift13 will you be our wedding officiant? 🤗🤗 it's all because if you we found each other!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@urnotmyhomeland @taylorswift13 No YOU are the sweetest!! Ily my #SwiftieSoulmate. I would go to WAR for you!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@americavdynasty #1 is my Religion of Choice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amyrenae2005 So, so, SO many times, it is insane. To this day, these characters will not HUSH. They pop up to correct things, to make changes, to tell me about past things I never got to approach, to tell me what they're up to now... it's like my subconscious knows it's not finished!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Formally announcing my digital engagement to my #Swiftie Soulmate Gwyn aka @urnotmyhomeland.  She made a poll. I voted &amp; 💍. She FINALLY responded! (Time zone differences.)

<|startoftext|>@amyrenae2005 Oh wow!!! That is so amazing, I have goosebumps. You've just made my entire week, truly. You don't know how bad I needed to hear this.

<|startoftext|>@realveronicaaa @iamlameguy @JWAndrews11 @taylorswift13 Exactly!! @taylorswift13 songs speak to every gender, every race, even fluidity. She speaks to HUMANITY. Her lyrics expand boundaries. She's limitless and timeless. There is no caging her in. There is no one genre or audience. She is so much more. She speaks to ALL of us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amyrenae2005 Oh my goodness, thank you!! Which one was it??   I have 2 getting reworked for actual publishing! One is getting a MAJOR revamp and changes, and another is finally being finished.  You don't know how happy it makes me when people still remember my writing. I want to cry! 😭🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@americavdynasty I love you! 🤗🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was getting ready to go to bed but this pissed me off so I'm gonna speak on it.  @iamlameguy = ASS @JWAndrews11 = BADASS  Listening to @taylorswift13 does NOT mean you're gay. MILLIONS of STRAIGHT MEN love Taylor! Don't assume! Never be disrespectful.  I'll come for you.  https://t.co/GTphRlFhJN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamlameguy @JWAndrews11 @fuckinenchanted Ummm... There are PLENTY (&amp; by plenty I mean *MILLIONS*) of STRAIGHT MEN who love and respect Taylor Swift, and rightfully so.  Pretty sure @taylorswift13 would be offended by this fucking comment &amp; if she isn't, I sure as shit am, bc this isn't funny or ok.  https://t.co/pTIfgcNcwc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fuckinenchanted What did you just do to me? And right before I go to sleep I chose to read this? HOW DARE YOU?  Any HUMAN BEING who does not wipe their ass does not deserve to...  I just...  Someone who...  Lord.  Y'all motherfuckers-  https://t.co/IL25iXjJ3t<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_iamkayak_ Omg same! Highly underrated impo.  #Breathe speaks to me on a deeply personal level, so I STILL cannot make it through a single listen without bawling through it. It just GUTS me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michilala Same!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iona_Lovella This night is flawless, don't you let it go I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone I'll spend forever wondering if you knew I was #Enchanted to meet you  Please don't be in love with someone else... Please don't have somebody waiting on you...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_iamkayak_ Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie. It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see. 'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down. Now I don't know what to be without you around.  ....  And I can't #breathe without you But I have to.  😭😭😭💔💔💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michilala 'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello" And your eyes look like coming home All I know is a simple name Everything has changed All I know is you held the door And you'll be mine and I'll be yours All I know since yesterday is #EverythingHasChanged<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zaynsfolklore I didn't post lyrics but Our Song just screams Country to me. As a girl who grew up in the country, I love it so much!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dayliight33 🤣 this word.  Tortoise = turtle = slow Also, last guy usually wins. Hmm... Ok  .  I'm taking my time Taking my time 'Cause you took everything from me Watching you climb Watching you climb Over people like me #MadWoman  🐢<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@americavdynasty I like shiny things,  but I'd marry you with #PaperRings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@runninglkewater It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you. Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine. I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right. I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind...  I go #BackToDecember all the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dioadytya A string that pulled me Out of all the wrong arms right into that dive bar Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire Chains around my demons Wool to brave the seasons One single thread of gold tied me to you  #InvisibleString 💍<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm 5'3" and I'm a tough person in front of the bullshit you dare speak of.  🤣🤣🤣🤣 Obviously my phone is still in a #mood I'm currently TRYING to let go of.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@REDfolklore Oh damn. I love both, and I'm probably gonna get struck down for going against the herd, but Dear John. *ducks*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What did you think I'd say to that? Does a scorpion sting when fighting back? They strike to kill, ...and you know I will.  https://t.co/3oPEOKgtAa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@folklore13rep I'm struggling with it, too. I ranked the songs after a 1st listen &amp; since then my opinions have drastically changed on some songs; others are the same.  Honestly afraid to say "least favs" bc of offending those who adore the ones I don't. 🤣 Does that make sense?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RachelKatzin_ Same hon, same! Honored to be your friend! The more I learn about and from you, the more I adore! 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to give a special shout-out to @RachelKatzin_ tonight: A kind, warm, understanding, compassionate human. I had a feeling about this 1 from the start &amp; I was right. She's amazing. Not only a #Swiftie but an #Activist as well, like me. BE INSPIRED ~ FOLLOW HER!  💚 you Rach.  https://t.co/NK6MfzP1NG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@urnotmyhomeland Thank you bb. Ily too. 🤗<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Regarding DMs:  Within the last 9 or so days, I've had over 240+ new DMs &amp;&amp; 100+ DM requests in my inbox awaiting &amp;&amp; more incoming. They usually pile in as most recent on top, &amp; yes some are more urgent. I see you &amp; I'm trying to get to you. Thanks for your patience. Ily all. 💋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@riya_ku12 Exactly. I've had moments where I'm like, enough, I'm going to be an ass, but then later I regret it bc it's not the real me. I can be firm when I have to be but never mean. I just can't. I'm too tender-hearted. I always want to help &amp; give. Why is that so bad?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is my daily struggle. Right here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry, excuse all my nonsensical venting and ranting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't get it. I'm a kind person. I wear my heart on my sleeve. I know it.  I always get taken advantage of.  But I remain kind. I remain sweet. It's in my nature.  It's who I am. I love people. I love to give.  People tell me I'm too kind but I don't care.  ...Should I?  Idfk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just don't know what to do.  Like our Lord &amp; Savior says, The haters are going to hate The players are going to play ...so I SHOULD just shake it off.  But right now I'm so 😤💔🤬😶😞😖😫😭😭😭💔  Like what even happened and why did this person do this?  Fml. I HATE THIS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I appreciate you guys being here for me. Idk if it's even "appropriate" for me to be talking about it on here, even though I'm not mentioning names. But I'm HUMAN &amp; this isn't right. I do this out of the kindness of my heart bc I want to &amp; to be shit on &amp; slapped down just sucks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It literally came out of NOWHERE!! That's what I don't get!! No proof, I have no idea why/what even, this person just came back w a DM &amp; was so MEAN &amp; I'm sitting here like wth?? After what I just did for you bc I THOUGHT you were sweet &amp; BAM!  Breaks my fucking spirit. 💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Long story short - Selected someone as bonus winner last giveaway &amp; bought them something. After doing so, they turned around, VERY cruel &amp; said unkind, untrue, unwarranted things w ZERO proof &amp; I feel so taken advantage of &amp; slapped in the face!! Why? How? WHAT?!  I cant-  😭💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm seriously about to cry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ughhhhh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so freaking upset and hurt right now it is not even funny. 😤😤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@almostfuckingdo IF A MAN TALKS SHIT THEN I OWE HIM NOTHING!!  https://t.co/BpyS0xPwEw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AF13RGLOW If I'm REALLY in a hurry • Don't Blame Me • Getaway Car<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AF13RGLOW The whole album bc there are no skips!   If I'm in a hurry... • End Game • I Did Something Bad  • Don't Blame Me • So It Goes... • Getaway Car • Call It What You Want<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@folkwhorez @PanicAtTheDisco @taylorswift13 You are NOT being mean. It's all there in black &amp; white, plain as day.  I never paid any attention to the band. I really liked his personality &amp; talent bc of the doc w/Taylor.   Well that went to hell fast bc of this video.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And only Brandon needs to own up to his words and actions and suffer the consequences.  All I'm saying is, please don't assume @taylorswift13 knew or is guilty by association or supports this behavior. She would NEVER.  Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brandon's actions &amp; words are only his own. It is NOT @taylorswift13's responsibility to sit there, run background checks &amp; sift through decades of archives of behavior on singers/bands before she works w/them.  Maybe she knew him after he changed. Idk. But he's still responsible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now b4 ppl attack @taylorswift13 (or me 4pointing out her working w him after) PLEASE CONSIDER: I highly DOUBT Taylor EVER knew Brandon said/did this to/w his fans.   That is NOT Taylor. She defends survivors fiercely. She'd NEVER allow it!  DO NOT BLAME HER. HE'S A GROWN MAN!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I already see many more joining the giveaway since I extended it. I see additional followers, new friends, kindness &amp; appreciation. I see YOU. 🤗🤗  Thanks all. I'll talk to you in the morning. It's after 3 in the morning here.  Sweet dreams. 🛌<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@intheweedswift Honey I understand.

<|startoftext|>@allnewromantics @intheweedswift I wanns go searching for these the next time I go to market, but  1. I have no idea how to pronounce them so I'd just be pointing &amp; staring &amp; making gestures like a mime  2. I'm terrified of being poked bc they all look like spiky cactus &amp; HOW DO YOU EAT THEM??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stoIenlullabies @intheweedswift @lilybabykay @allnewromantics 🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allnewromantics @intheweedswift I've lived in Fl half my life. The most "tropical" I get is kiwis, pineapple, and oranges. 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stoIenlullabies @intheweedswift @lilybabykay ...and then @allnewromantics spins me when she throws in the adjective "tropical" like it means something BIG and now I'm REALLY confuzzled. #help<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stoIenlullabies @intheweedswift @lilybabykay Me right now:  https://t.co/IDuZQ6Xb42<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allnewromantics @intheweedswift Wait what do you mean by TROPICAL fruits??  Is there a distinct difference? Like in location? Color? Taste? Tropicalness?  Bc I'm already confused! And now I can't rest until I LEARN dammit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@intheweedswift @stoIenlullabies @lilybabykay Y'ALL 🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣  ARE  CRACKING MY ASS  UPPPPPP  You guys have me so confused  and I'm laughing so hard I'm crying  and I don't know which way is North, South, East, or West and I have no idea what fruit is what and I'm pretty sure y'all don't either  But y'all are FUN!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@intheweedswift @lilybabykay 🤣🤣🤣🤣  https://t.co/J0XoalW1Vj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilybabykay @intheweedswift I like you. Let's be friends!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilybabykay @intheweedswift  https://t.co/ySSEEEx21R<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Back when we were still changing for the better, Wanting was enough ...For me, it was enough.  To live for the hope of it all.  https://t.co/FQNp5eieaH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilybabykay @intheweedswift ...btw as I'm looking for the seat in my time-out corner,   *whispers*  ... which one is the dragon fruit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilybabykay @intheweedswift 🤣🤣🤣 Oh! Ok I've heard that one before BUT I've never actually seen one in a market... only purchased it in drinks made for me. 🙈  I'm just gonna go have a seat and think about my life choices.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@intheweedswift ...I live in America - do we have different fruits? I'm perplexed.🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@intheweedswift I have no idea I have no idea I have no idea &amp; I have no idea ... but I swear I 💛 fruits!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@urnotmyhomeland @SwiftCamzz Preach!  https://t.co/8sNqutSEfx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taylucifer95 I 💚 them all but #Cardigan owns my spirit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsgracefolks 🤣🤣🤣 Poor thing, I'm so sorry!  https://t.co/vT4zpKBDKQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@urnotmyhomeland @SwiftCamzz Yessss, same girl!! What WAS life before?? I haven't made it a single day without listening to #Folklore. I can't imagine living in a world without it now. So strange.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you don't appreciate @taylorswift13's #Reputation 4all that it is &amp; @RecordingAcad could never see, we CAN'T be friends.  Rep=my religion. I will go down w/that ship like Jack holding Rose or @WillieNelson clutching his last bag of weed, you feel me?  Thx for 🎧 2my @TEDTalks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stoIenlullabies Ahhh...I thought I recognized that line! Yeah I haven't made it past that point yet. Eeek! 🙈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stoIenlullabies ... what are we watching?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@STRCROSSED 🤣🤣🤣 I know. I aggravate my damn self on a daily basis. It's no wonder I have only a handful of friends. I can barely tolerate myself and my brain!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@urnotmyhomeland @SwiftCamzz ... I'm so grateful for #Folklore. I KNOW it's 100% pure Taylor, for Taylor &amp; us, exactly Joe she saw it and heard it, no one else's input or judgement or expectation or anything. A love letter to herself and us. Makes it magical and meaningful.   Idk if that make sense?🤷‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@urnotmyhomeland @SwiftCamzz Yes, same!! Watching #MissAmericana made me appreciate Me! a lot bc of how happy and excited she was.   I struggle w/aspects of #Lover bc the whole Grammys issue w/Rep &amp; wonder if she fed into making it likeable for the masses vs herself. Which is why...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only 1 #Folklore song can survive! Which will you save, #Swifties?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@urnotmyhomeland @SwiftCamzz 🤗🤣 awe bb I could NEVER hate you!!   Okay let's see... Favorite... Cardigan is truly creeping up there fast, but before it, I'd say Back To December &amp; Begin Again.  Least Favorite... As far as singles go, I've never been a big fan of Me! (but the video is cute).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is gorgeous! As a GA, I love the thought process behind this. &amp; I think @taylorswift13 would adore this! 💛💚<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@delicaterep13 @SwiftCamzz Taylor Swift. '06 I am that old and that wise. 🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>6th  This or That  @taylorswift13 #Folklore Track Challenge  Peace   -or-  Hoax  ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am extremely obsessed w both songs. #Reputation is my religion. Picking a favorite is like picking a lung BUT bc I created the game &amp; am asking y'all to pick, I must to. No matter what answer I give I'm gonna be wrong but...  I Did Something Bad (bc Live on @Netflix omg!)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5th!  This or That  @taylorswift13 #Reputation Track Favorite Edition  I Did Something Bad  -OR-  Don't Blame Me  ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This one is hard for me bc I adore both men &amp; songs, but I just love the raw honesty of Tom, their relationship, Taylor admitting her role with both Calvin &amp; Tom even after the media made Tom out to be the bad guy, and Getaway Car's result, so I gotta go with B.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4th!  This or That @taylorswift13 Hottest Romance/Fling &amp; Best Song Result After  A.) Harry Styles + Style B.) Tom Hiddleston + Getaway Car  https://t.co/wKsnDuJtyL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wouldabeenfun @taylorswift13 🤣🤣 I admit I LOVE his older music and he's a douche, but at least he admits he's a douche. He shouldn't have done what he did to her, esp when she was so young and impressionable.  #DancingInABurningRoom is 🔥🔥🔥🔥 though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@runninglkewater @taylorswift13 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My answer to this would be: Forget Joe (meh) Torture John (for quite a long time, preferable with a butter knife, fucker) Revenge Calvin (I hate him sfm after what he did &amp; my research on their relationship ugh!)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As much as I love B bc of the what-if, A forever captures my heart.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@intheweeeds @taylorsfoIklore Oooh, while I love both, I've recently been researching the history &amp; media reports behind the Calvin/ Taylor end, her running off with Tom, that whirlwind fling &amp; how everything ended so #GetawayCar has been standing out a lot more to me. 💛 its epic &amp; raw honesty!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ayyuswift That line is so powerful. I applaud everyone who is in who wants to be in the medical field. #Epiphany doesn't get the credit it deserves impo. She did wonders tying it together with the battlefield.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LesaRobertson20 @genezog7 I am a PROUD resister and would love to make friends with fellow resisters. Hello everyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tayllicitaffair This is so much pressure...  https://t.co/XfcIGzyoNC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry I have been MIA from Twitter today.  Female Problems + Major Cramps + Fever = Me curled up in bed with a heating pad trying/failing to sleep it off while humming #BadBlood and cursing my reproductive parts. 🤣😬😭  Swiftie Ladies, I know you can relate.  https://t.co/bvdJf0vqIZ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lNVISIBLESTRlNG @taylorswift13 ** hugs** I try to treat people how I want to be treated! But it's in my nature to be giving and loving  I'm extremely passionate &amp; goofy. 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4ugustux @taylorswift13 Aww! That's okay! Fun little secret: The writer in me loves making friends with shy people because I'm a naturally curious person, so I'm a great conversation starter!  Let's start with some simple questions! • What is your name? • Where are you from? • Fav song atm?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THIS is what it's about! Why I LOVE connecting w/#Swifties &amp; forming bonds. @taylorswift13 unites us.  I 💛 making friends. Giving &amp; DMing special people BONUS surprises too!  Don't be afraid to talk &amp; get to know the real me. I 💛 chatting music, books, tv, you name it! 🤗🥂🌿  https://t.co/Mc8HjzUJMD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@urnotmyhomeland You made me feel special from the moment you became a friend on here, as I'm sure you do everyone else! There's something unique about you dear. You've got the SPARK, just like our girl Taylor. Thrilled I could make your morning w/Swift Swag! YOU DESERVE IT! Love you back! Xoxo  https://t.co/qcSxzJaSMZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeiymd 🤣🤣🤣 whoops didn't think about that! My bad!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this emoji good? 🥺 People keep posting it on my things &amp; I THINK it means on the verge of tears/emotional &amp; HOPE it's not rolling eyes..   I'm in my early 30s y'all. Help an old Swiftie out here please. I hope people are just emotional like I am &amp; not annoyed at me. 🤣🤞🙈<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@STRCROSSED Oooh you have me deeply intrigued! Not to sound like a creepy serial killer but the writer/creator in me wants to dive into your brain &amp; get more ideas! (You should DM me!! I LOVE where your head is at! 🙏)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lxrryswift Most certainly! I still feel like it's the 1st time playing it every time I listen to it! It has that nostalgic feeling I adore and crave. Gives me Sheryl Crow + Cranberries vibes too! Sooo good!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imbeingtooloud Great choice! It's been the easiest for me to collect item ideas for. I have so many thoughts bc the song speaks volumes about her feelings, plus the way it emotes, nevermind the literal ideas!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>To #LGBTQ+ being outed/bullied:  Your sexuality doesn't define you &amp; as someone in their early 30s, I PROMISE you more people explore it than you can IMAGINE. You're not alone! The world is huge &amp; accepting. It gets EASIER. You'll be ok. CHIN UP.  DM to talk/vent.  I 💛 you. ~A.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Taylors_loverxx Sweetie I'm sorry this is happening to you. If I lived closer I'd form a wall around you &amp; physically beat the everliving shit outta anyone bullying you. Thats just the mamabear/big sis/protector in me. No one deserves this. Know #ITGETSBETTER. DM me if you need to talk. ❤💛<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HEY! MUSIC LOVERS!  Who are the BEST songwriters [any genre] in your opinion??  Share with me! I want to listen.  #AppreciationPost #Songwriters #Storytellers #Lyricists #Lyrics #Music #QuestionOfTheDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whatever you take from the song is your own takeaway; regardless, it's a goddamn masterpiece. Phil Collins is UNDERRATED in the legends category impo, but still legend. So happy he's being exposed to a younger generation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhilCollinsFeed claims he wrote the song due to his divorce.  He ALSO played his own drums and keyboard in this track, wrote the lyrics himself, and did the production...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>or non-literal, like suffering mentally, like having a breakdown in front of someone and begging for help, and them choosing not to help, assuming they're either crying wolf again or just deciding not to care about them.  ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fun Facts: A lot of people believe this song means someone sees a person drowning, whether it be literal, like on a boat or something, and could have saved the man but didn't (whether it be they didn't know how to swim or simply didn't feel like saving them for whatever reason);<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welcome to the great, the classic, the legendary, gentleman! @PhilCollins is BOSS. Glad you joined us!   "The hurt doesn't show, but the pain still grows... It's no stranger to you and me." [Drums.]  What an incredible journey. Thank you PHIL COLLINS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afterglowmila I love both. They're great.  #TheLastTime when the build up hits, it hits harder and lasts longer  #Exile emotes deeper for me, and the production is well thought out and placed  The stories are similar but different, too. TLT gives hope; Exile has none left.  🤷‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sparksbeflying I love every album. My personal favorites are Reputation &amp; Folklore. I always find myself playing those. Reputation is my most-relatable and Folklore means the most to me personally atm, for many reasons. But I get why so many people praise albums like Speak Now, 1989, Red...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess #TheLakes DID leak bc I'm seeing lyrics &amp; stuff posted. I REFUSE to click audios.  This ISN'T FAIR to @taylorswift13. She worked too hard.  Those #Swifties listening &amp; resharing SHOULD BE ASHAMED.  It's called CONSENT. Taylor's OWNERSHIP.  Scott? Scooter? Ring any bells??  https://t.co/Jx6Q3lAdbd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TSwiftNZ I hope so but you never know. Fandom conspiracies run wild and sometimes I allow myself to get caught up in the hype so I'm trying not to expect anything.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@selenATEors My prayers haven't stopped. I'm right here if anyone needs to know they're not alone. Keep hope. Stay safe. Get as far away as possible and go underground if possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is real life and this is happening right now. People are terrified that more bombs are going to go off and they are going to die. Check in with people, even if it's strangers via Twitter, &amp; offer hope &amp; pray with them, if not help.  #PrayForLebanon #PrayForBeirut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fxckyouforever @taylorswift13 I'm praying so hard. You're gonna be ok. Please believe that, you've gotta believe it. Get as far away and take as much shelter underground as you can. @taylorswift13 loves you, we all love you. Please don't lose hope. You'll be okay. Believe it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's been 6 weeks since I lost my Gramma.  It's been 2 weeks since I lost my 54yo Daddy unexpectedly.   1 month &amp; my household, family, my Matriarch &amp; my Mountain, was stolen from me.💔  When I say @taylorswift13 &amp; #Folklore RESCUED ME, I mean it.  Idk where I'd be w/o her rn...  https://t.co/X2mvrmthgr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seeitinmymind More than you could possibly know.  This past month, I lost 2 of my closest family members - my Gramma &amp; my Daddy. My household went from 6 to 3 (now it's just me, my mom, &amp; my son). Both passed unexpectedly &amp; just 3 weeks apart. @taylorswift13 &amp; #Folklore may have saved me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gainswiftmoots Me ~ @AngelaMShrum 💛  • I ALWAYS FOLLOW BACK! • @taylorswift13 fan since 2006 • Dying for fellow #Swifties fans as friends • I have wine 🍷and of course I am willing to share it!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gainswiftmoots Gotcha!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I remember when I was a kid, wishing I could be an adult.  Now I'm an adult, wishing I could remember what it was like to turn my arm, or squat, or lean back, without hearing something crack or pop or dislodge.  Stay forever young, kids. Adulting is a (literal) pain in the ass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tayllicitaffair @YouTube Yesss!! This is the only piano version I HAVE heard out of the songs you listed above and I am obsessed!! I cannot make it through it to this day without my emotions breaking. 100x better than the OG!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tayllicitaffair Link me!! I wanna hear piano versions! Are they on @YouTube??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I understand fans are sad they haven't gotten a chance to meet @taylorswift13; I haven't gotten to meet her NOR have I seen her in concert YET, BUT let's not be discouraged/bitter!  Let's ENJOY her 🎶, fellow #Swifties who are celebrating their experiences, &amp; live vicariously! 💛<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TaylorSwift #Debut #APerfectlyGoodHeart  Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart? Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now? Why would you wanna make the very first scar? Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?  ...It's not unbroken anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TaylorSwift #Debut #Invisible  I just wanna show you She don't even know you, She's never gonna love you like I want to. And you just see right through me, But if you only knew me We could be a beautiful Miracle, Unbelievable Instead of just invisible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TaylorSwift #Debut #ImOnlyMeWhenImWithYou  I'm only up when you're not down Dont wanna fly if you're still on the ground It's like no matter what I do Well you drive me crazy 1/2 the time The other 1/2 I'm only tryn let U know that what I feel is true I'm only me when I'm w/you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TaylorSwift #Debut #OurSong  Our song is the way he laughs The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss him, when I should have" And when I got home ... 'fore I said, "Amen" Asking God if he could play it again Play it again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TaylorSwift #Debut #MarysSong  Take me back to the house in the backyard tree Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me You never did, you never did Take me back when our world was 1 block wide I dared you to kiss me &amp; ran when you tried Just 2 kids, you &amp; I... Oh my my my<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TaylorSwift #Debut #ShouldveDaidNo  It was a moment of weakness &amp; you said, "Yes."  You should've said "No", you should've gone home You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go You should've known that word 'Bout what you did with her'd Get back to me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TaylorSwift #Debut #StayBeautiful  If you and I are a story That never gets told If what you are is a daydream I'll never get to hold At least you'll know  You're beautiful Every little piece love And don't you know You're really gonna be someone Ask anyone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TaylorSwift #Debut #TiedTogetherWithASmile  Hold on baby, you're losing it The water's high, you're jumping into it &amp; letting go &amp; no one knows That you cry, but you don't tell anyone that you might not be the golden one &amp; you're tied together w/a smile But you're coming undone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TaylorSwift #Debut #TheOutside  You saw me there, but never knew that I would give it all up to be a part of this, a part of you. And now it's all too late. So you see...  You could've helped if you had wanted to,  but no one notices until it's too late to do anything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TaylorSwift #Debut #APlaceInThisWorld  I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TaylorSwift #Debut #TeardropsOnMyGuitar  And there he goes, so perfectly The kind of flawless I wish I could be  She better hold him tight, give him all her love Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause  He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TaylorSwift #Debut #PictureToBurn  State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TaylorSwift #Debut #TimMcGraw  When you think happiness I hope you think that little black dress Think of my head on your chest And my old faded blue jeans When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think of me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TaylorSwift IS A LYRICAL GENIUS &amp; CRAFTSMAN STORYTELLER.

<|startoftext|>@trashswiffer I'll NEVER UNDERSTAND how #Lover won all the awards &amp; was critically praised but #Reputation got shit on &amp; Grammy snubbed.  Yes Lover had some good tracks. Yes Grammy's have turned into a shitshow (&amp; impo have been for a while.)  But Reputation is PURE GOLD &amp; they fucked it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@repugodtion Agreed!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TSintntlMerch I'm still struggling to find a word to describe #Cardigan because everytime I try my mind scrambles &amp; splinters &amp; scatters in multiple directions &amp; I end up on the floor sobbing at its glory.  https://t.co/43bJZy9CUG<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChurchofSatan 🤣🤣🤣 I know this is a joke.  ...But IF it weren't, do you really think #Swifties would need ANY church of ANY religion, let alone SATANISM, to do the work for them?

<|startoftext|>@tayllicitaffair @taylorswift13 1st time I heard Betty, I was confused 🧐 bc #Folklore's theme felt so mature &amp; forward in Taylor's career &amp; I felt it was a hard right turn &amp; step back &amp; didn't fit. But once I isolated it &amp; listened to it alone, I appreciated it more. Add in the love triangle story = awe! ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tayllicitaffair Yes!  + we cannot discredit the age-old Envy and how it always plays a factor, whether you're in the business or just a person next door. There's always going to be someone who wants what you have: "The grass is always greener" concept. That energy around you is exhausting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tayllicitaffair @taylorswift13 Amen!! Even #Betty has grown immensely for me and that was my least favorite track but still GOOD. Now I adore it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taylornation13 @swiftieprateek @taylorswift13 #Cardigan is still my favorite song on the album. If I haven't listened to it AT LEAST 25x a day call the paramedic bc I might be dead. I'm just sayin'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@swiftieprateek Gah! Oh, I hope!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tayllicitaffair Same! My rankings have changed since I first ranked them. I'm having regrets in a way. 🤣 This album is too damn good! @taylorswift13 knew! She KNEW she'd do this to is. I'm convinced she had to know this would be too good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tayllicitaffair *cough Kim Kardashian*  ...But seriously, I've had too many of these "women" in my life &amp; it makes me sick.  Women supporting women? THAT'S MY TYPE!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hello new followers ~ esp fellow fans of @taylorswift13! Whether you found me on your own or have followed me back, I see &amp; appreciate you.

I COULD NEVER.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I KNEW it would happen! After just one week of listening to #Folklore by #TaylorSwift nonstop, my perspective has changed on some songs &amp; favs are diff. Oh the POWER of TSwift. 🥰  Gonna have to update my review from this one:  https://t.co/LUJeKIlUYL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emmaswifty12 @taylornation13 Hahaha I'm not saying I may have done this but I'm not saying that I didn't do this either, all I WILL say is you and I kinda think alike, that's all 😉<|endoftext|>

I'm obsessed with both of those to this day! I still cannot play #Breathe without bawling like a baby. I resonate with that song on a severely personal level. @taylorswift13 is the master at diving into our souls w/o knowing us. Idk how she does this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Update: August 1st  Totally REGRET ranking #Exile so damn low...well, low for me. I get it now. Ya hear me? I GET IT. It has registered loud &amp; clear. Exile is indeed the shit &amp; deserves its praise. I love it. I play it all the time. I now give it 9/10!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LessGorgeousJoe That's cool! As a pro artist &amp; BA in GD, I have so many #Folkore ideas but wouldn't know where to upload them to order them bc of Covid restrictions 😭💔...  Yes. This is me fishing for host ideas. 😂🤣  Feel free to DM me! I'll send you 1 for free if you help!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@faggylad @nicoandthenigga @taytaeshoe @alyviabenson @faggylad wow desperately hunting down Taylor Swift fans/posts in order to bash her/them...makes me wonder what shitty things are going on in your life for you to be so eager to deflect this way. Like a tantrum throwing bitchbaby Karen on a rampage. 😂 Go eat a Snickers.  https://t.co/j4NZEs55KK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TSintntlMerch Same, only 3 so far, and only 1 giveaway currently still running.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@faggylad @taytaeshoe @alyviabenson Well @faggylad, you seem like a bot account; regardless, opinions are like assholes.  Of course I wildly disagree with every single thing you said &amp; would happily provide facts &amp; examples as to why, but feel it'd be a waste of my time to do so. 🤷‍♀️  Carry on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TSintntlMerch It does! I'm obsessed with cardigans and I want it soooo bad. I've entered every giveaway I've seen. Oh, what I would give!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry not sorry that all I'm tweeting about rn is Taylor Swift &amp; her new album #Folklore. It's been a happy distraction for me with all the recent personal tragedies I've experienced this month &amp; darkness this year. I welcome it.  Plus she's 🥰 &amp; I'm not ashamed to be her fan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TSintntlMerch The single or the clothing item? 😂 BC I have the album but not the clothing item but how I so want it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TSintntlMerch It won't let me DM you, so... I am extremely interested if #Cardigan is still available!?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alyviabenson Thanks love! 🤗🥰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mfstern Oh that's just his demons trying to escape. Too many pushed into one body will do that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alyviabenson Here you go! As promised, his response!   (Right below where you can see, he posted a .gif of a raccoon winking with the words 'gotcha' captioned below, bc we always joke like that.)  https://t.co/VeG2zwqhBt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alyviabenson Yes agreed, that is the hardest part, &amp; that never changes w/love. Doesn't matter if you're 13, 20, 40, or 80 yrs old. Jumping into it is always a deep risk when there's a deep friendship rooted first. God it sucks. The "what if" is such a pain in the ass mystery!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alyviabenson Btw, I just screen capped this conversation and sent it to him via Facebook Messenger, haha. I'll let you know if he responds! It could be something sweet and romantic -OR- it could be something like "Cool" and then him asking me how my day is... 🤷‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alyviabenson I know. 😭💔 It's scarier being adults. I've been married &amp; divorced &amp; have a 7yo son. He lives in diff state. We talk all the time &amp; he's my BFF. We have so much love. But what it it all got ruined? 😱 I couldn't survive losing him. He's locked in as my far away dream world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taytaeshoe @alyviabenson Now all we need is a classic rock Taylor, a blues Taylor, a jazz Taylor... ahhhhhh, I can't wait. She can conquer it all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alyviabenson Yep. I've had a "what if" person and he knows exactly who he is &amp; is in agreement that I am his "what if", too. Crazy/sad thing is, we're both adults, been close friends half our lives, talk openly about it, know what we could/should be, but are both still too scared to jump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@repugodtion Do NOT make me pick! I CANNOT. Imma do all 3.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>W/all being said, after an incredible journey during today's #FolkloreListeningParty -  My #Top5 Fav Tracks CURRENTLY* Are: • My Tears Ricochet • Peace • Cardigan • This Is Me Trying • Seven  &amp; so many more! So hard to pick!! 🥰😍  Buy @taylorswift13's new album, #Folklore!  https://t.co/ySy6Pv9N89<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So... drumroll, please!  #FolkloreListeningParty   ...  https://t.co/wMQcZIaZjt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh I still can't get over #Cardigan.  It's giving me MAJOR Damon/Elena/#TVD/#Delena vibes atm. It's like their personal love song.  ...Yet so much more, too.  @taylorswift13 is a genius, we knew this, but this track is EVERYTHING.  #FolkloreListeningParty 🎧  https://t.co/Cppoi1TFws<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Cardigan: 9.5/10 1000% a DREAM WORLD. Definitely the best choice for the 1st single for #Folklore. Lyrics are sensational &amp; the melody sweeps you away into multiple dreamscapes. Pure magic.  This song is tied for 2nd place for me! 🥰  @taylorswift13 #FolkloreListeningParty  https://t.co/ReGZebnDPc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Exile (@taylorswift13 ft. @boniver): 7.5/10  2 sides of breakup: You never gave a warning sign (vs.) I gave so many signs  🤔 ARGH! NO! I had HIGH expectations!

<|startoftext|>Time Curious time Gave me no compasses Gave me no signs Were there clues I didn't see? And isn't it just so pretty to think All along there was some #InvisibleString Tying you to me?  @taylorswift13 #Folklore #FolkloreListeningParty 🎧  https://t.co/kuWyKOqWGj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Hoax Saddest 💔 on #Folklore. Got some Bella/Edward #NewMoon #Twilight vibes: when she stood @ cliff &amp; lead up b4 like the empty months in book.

<|startoftext|>#Peace: 9.5/10  To me, this is the buried treasure of the #Folklore album &amp; of @taylorswift13's heart.  Coming to terms w/your innermost pure, raw, honest, insecure revelations.

<|startoftext|>#Betty has more of a pre-teen feel. Not vibing to it atm. Far too Apple Pie Innocent in a blatantly obvious sort of way.

<|startoftext|>@TauPengL Personally, I wouldn't loot, but IDGAF if others do. Big corps have insurance, ain't losing shit, and could afford it anyway.   Plus looting has been going for centuries.

<|startoftext|>America, yes.  But no thanks to - or with help from - piss-pore, useless, spineless, "I take no responsibility" aka "I don't give a shit about Americans" @realDonaldTrump.  We'll make it without him &amp; we'll better for it. 🇺🇲🌊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VAminds @BarackObama Actually, no. @BarackObama: - Tested over 1 MILLION ppl within 1st month of H1N1 outbreak.

<|startoftext|>@VAminds @BarackObama 1st of all, it's "speaks".  2nd, everything he did was better. He was a REAL leader. He CARED. He FOUGHT FOR US. He showed COMPASSION. You can deny it all you want but the past 4 yrs have been a disaster. But go ahead, deny all you want and let the blind lead the blind. 🐑<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@intouchweekly Good luck trying. I can't imagine ANY publisher would touch it w/a 100ft pole. The backlash &amp; outcry it would cause, and w/good reason.

<|startoftext|>@michxlle0 @end_all_cancer @caseymarieshobo @DNC I do NOT believe this is for #CayleesLaw. I do not believe you're doing this for anyone other than Casey Anthony and your own notoriety. All you've argued is how you've been there for CASEY, scoured the country to be near HER, so forth. You're obsessed. You're not well.  &lt;cont&gt;<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michxlle0 @end_all_cancer @caseymarieshobo @DNC Frankly, I am BEGGING you to stop. Stop promoting yourself and your cause and your foolish beliefs on MY platform.

<|startoftext|>@TafGato I'm sorry but if you believe the buck stopped there, that Gary Condit wasn't in on it, called the shot (or his handlers did), &amp;/or found a fall guy...well, you should do more research.

<|startoftext|>@caseymarieshobo So...from your Twitter account, you seem to strongly support this woman, but your responses to me seem contradictory to that support. What is it exactly you believe?

<|startoftext|>@BullPatriot 💔💔💔 thank you for telling me. I knew they were looking and heard remains had been discovered - so finally they're confirmed as hers?

<|startoftext|>Yessssss! I'm ready, I've been ready. The world still needs her badly. Queen @MichelleObama!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RESPECT 👏👏 @ewarren<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/Yu3QG2i2jM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd be ok if @JoeBiden picked @ewarren or @AOC for VP, but let's be honest...if he picked @BarackObama, I'd die happily. Every1 knows how much I LOVE Obama &amp; miss their #bromance. They'd be UNDEFEATED. Yes I know every1 says he needs a woman VP &amp; get it, but COME ON. IT'S OBAMA!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrBiden is a real, brave, intelligent, powerful woman and a badass. I've loved and adored her for 13+ years now. She's tough as nails. She doesn't get enough credit or acknowledgement.   So I wanna take a moment to say: All the applause to her. 👏<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RobertoConQueso Idk why I even try to educate you. Your "logic &amp; conclusion" makes no sense. You took my FACTS, twisted them so wrongfully to suit YOUR AGENDA, &amp; made it A+B = 6x=89#&amp;,'wtffff?oknvmigive!  I'm done trying. You're in your own little small-minded world. Enjoy the shallow comforts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bernie vs Biden  Here's the facts: - Campaign opinions can be merged because @JoeBiden &amp;/or @BernieSanders may have a change of heart on what matters most to the people - TRUMP MUST GO. - @DNC MUST CONQUER. - We, the Public, MUST PREVAIL. - Divided we fall! - #VOTEBLUENOMATTERWHO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertoConQueso A FETUS is 100% dependent on it's MOTHER'S body, because she is BORN LIVING HUMAN BEING &amp; it is NOT; a woman is NOT simply a "container" to harbor the unborn.  A "right to life" doesn't = the right to use someone else's body, nor the "right to live" by threatening another's life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Read this in it's entirety. Itll become clear.  #MyRightMyDecision   https://t.co/hGC830flfp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertoConQueso Exactly my thoughts. A woman is an alive, living, breathing, HUMAN PERSON. You can't have it both ways. You can't be #ProLife until the baby pops out, IS alive, &amp; God Forbid becomes a female, then say screw you, I decide for you, you no longer matter. THAT'S twisted &amp; fucked up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...and this is another reason why....  #ProChoice  #IStandWithWomen #ReproductiveRights #HealthCare #MyRightMyDecision  #WomensHistoryMonth  #WomenDignityMarch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertoConQueso Forcing a woman to alter her life forever, cause her psychological and mental harm, and perhaps her safety is what's selfish &amp; evil. Especially when you don't know their background.  You cannot be #ProLife if you care about a fetus more than a PERSON. WAKE UP. #IronyAtBest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I HAVE, DO, &amp; WILL ALWAYS STAND BY A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE. It's safe &amp; smart. It's her body. Her right. Her safety. Her health. It's #HealthCare.

<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan 😭😭😭👏👏👏  I miss @BarackObama every single day. I watch clips of him on @YouTube just to remember what a REAL PRESIDENT was like. Just watch how ppl respect him vs Trump. Esp those Barack vs Trump = Raw Reality. America's President. My personal hero. #StillMYPresident<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#StillMYPresident @BarackObama  I was so proud during this moment. I cried my eyes out. The full speech was PERFECTION. I remember voting and watching coverage 2 nights in a row w/o sleep just to get to that moment. I'll never forget it or what he has done for me since. 😭❤🙌<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Gillian Flynn's #SharpObjects novel &amp; @HBO miniseries just EXPLODED my brain.🤯 I cannot believe I waited this long to watch this &amp; pick up the damn book. @StephenKing was right - I cannot get this story out of my head.

<|startoftext|>@aljansantos @Ajithku25002718 @yangp84 @AndrewYang @BernieSanders @BetoORourke @JulianCastro @JoeBiden @CNN Sadly true. I loved Biden as VP for Obama but he's not ready.

<|startoftext|>@TomiLahren @AOC Honey, please. You couldn't be 1% as good as @AOC, even if her soul took over your body, bc you'd still have your brain.

<|startoftext|>&lt;pt 3&gt; PERSONALLY, I wouldn't support some1 who treats @JeffreeStar &amp; @shanedawson, my friends &amp; loyal clients, someone who has has my back since DAY 1, like shit, esp for a person as low as @jamescharles. He is a scumbag. Fuck his fake apologies. He's all about drama... 🤮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>&lt;pt 2&gt; It just seems personally shady to me &amp; turns my stomach.

<|startoftext|>@rianabierman @MorpheBrushes Clearly you don't realize the severity of the situation.

<|startoftext|>@MorpheBrushes Stop promoting/selling/attempting to cover up/ignore the James Charles situation &amp; then we'll see. You should feel ashamed.

<|startoftext|>@GlamLifeGuru Love you Tati!! Sorry you're still feeling down, you didn't deserve any if it but you DO deserve to stop &amp; process.

<|startoftext|>I'm a HUGE fan of @MorpheBrushes but if they don't get rid of all @jamescharles products, I will boycott them in a ♥️beat.

<|startoftext|>#WhyIDidntReport  I told my BFF (I lived w/her fam in FL-5 states away from my fam) about the rape right after. She snuck me in the house, threw me in the shower, washed away all the evidence, &amp; begged me to not say anything bc we didn't want to be separated.   So I didn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adblanche I'm so sorry. I couldn't "prove" anything bc my friend threw me in the shower immediately after telling her and washed it all away; or w/my best friend's uncle when I was young bc it was my word against his.  I have PTSD &amp; checked myself into treatment 2x. I still relive it, too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WhyIDidntReport  I knew the odds were stacked against me. These men, though years apart with their assaults, knew a lot of ppl, had solid alibies, &amp; ppl who'd back them. I was young. Then I was young, broke, and out of state. What could *I* possibly do?  I pushed it under a rug.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WhyIDidntReport  *I* trusted them. *I* was naive enough to believe they cared about me and could never hurt me *I* allowed them to control my decision to not report, or try harder to report.

<|startoftext|>&lt;bonus #2&gt; Damon was in love w/Elena from the beginning, it's even more clear as you rewatch TVD. Their scenes &amp; build ups &amp; all the obstacles, their love prevailed. They survived, just like she told him they would. My #delena heart. I miss them sooooo much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>&lt;bonus&gt; That's what I think. Damon had his humanity off for 5 to 10 seconds, that's it. He didn't do it purposely, he didn't become the bad guy people expected; Stefan did though; like when he drove the car on the bridge where she almost died, threatening to kill her. #noshade 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>&lt;cont 4&gt;That scream snapped him right back so fast, it made his head spin, which is why he stumbled back into the doorway, &amp; later, threw the glass. His humanity getting turned back on &amp; him realizing he hurt the only person that was his friend, whom he loved, BROKE him. 😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>&lt;cont 3&gt; Damon didn't expect Elena to be his humanity; he had no idea. He knew there was something about her that made him so attracted, but he didn't understand internal emotions, or LOVE yet, or the result of pain, until SHE came into his life. &lt;cont to 4&gt;<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>&lt;cont 2&gt; screamed "No!" and dropped to the ground &amp; cried and gave him #thatlook, he turned it right back on, and then was shaken when he realized what he'd done.

<|startoftext|>“Once upon a time there was a hazel-eyed boy with dimples. I called him Khalil. The world called him a thug. He lived, but not nearly long enough, and for the rest of my life I’ll remember how he died.”  ― Angie Thomas, The Hate U Give<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“They act like I’m the official representative of the black race and they owe me an explanation. I think I understand though. If I sit out a protest, I’m making a statement, but if they sit out a protest, they look racist.”  ― Angie Thomas, The Hate U Give<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“They didn't mention that he was unarmed.”  ― Angie Thomas, The Hate U Give<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“Your voices matter, your dreams matter, your lives matter. Be the roses that grow in the concrete.”  ― Angie Thomas, The Hate U Give<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>&lt;cont&gt; ...is experiencing this pain with us despite not knowing me or Khalil. My silence isn’t helping Us. Daddy fixes his gaze on the road again. He nods. “Yeah. Can’t be silent.”  ― Angie Thomas, The Hate U Give<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>&lt;cont&gt; I matter more to him than a movement. I’m his baby, and I’ll always be his baby, and if being silent means I’m safe, he’s all for it. This is bigger than me and Khalil though. This is about Us, with a capital U; everybody who looks like us, feels like us, and... &lt;cont&gt;<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“A lump forms in my throat as the truth hits me. Hard. “That’s why people are speaking out, huh? Because it won’t change if we don’t say something.” “Exactly. We can’t be silent.” “So I can’t be silent.” Daddy stills. He looks at me. I see the fight in his eyes. ... &lt;cont&gt;<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“Don’t fall for that trap. That’s what they want. If you don’t wanna speak out, that’s up to you, but don’t let it be because you’re scared of them. Who do I tell you that you have to fear?”   “Nobody but God.”   ― Angie Thomas, The Hate U Give<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>“I never know which Starr I should be. I can use some slang, but not too much slang, some attitude, but not too much attitude, so I’m not a 'sassy black girl.' I have to watch what I say and how I say it, but I can’t sound 'white.”  ― Angie Thomas, The Hate U Give<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“Some things I can't reveal, like Natasha. Once you've seen how broken someone is it's like seeing them naked—you can't look at them the same anymore.”  ― Angie Thomas, The Hate U Give<|endoftext|>

They made a big deal into an even bigger deal, and in my opinion, unlawfully so.  That's all I'm gonna say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They're there to serve and protect BOTH sides. In order to SERVE - they should have listened and explained to BOTH parties.

<|startoftext|>for whatever reason, and they weren't demanded to pay the bill.  9.) The cop, after "hearing" her side, he then says, "Why are you arguing over the price of Orange Juice", clearly making a JUDGEMENT, and dismissing it like it isn't a big deal. To some, it might not be, but ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, it's a pain for the employees who were cooking it, and it's a cost on the restaurant, but still, not a crime. I can't tell you how many times I've seen all different types and colors of people order food in restaurants and then change their mind or have to leave...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>2) I believe books are the only medium that can be interpreted solely on each individual reader's perspective, thus making it the most powerful source of media.

<|startoftext|>Of course, I'd do my best to protect them, I'd use my body as a shield if I had to, but it shouldn't be a requirement for me or any other teacher to have to take on this responsibility! (cont)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am fearful for myself, as a licensed Substitue Teacher, and what fighting/gun requirements I might be forced into cooperation, in order to obtain/retain my job and protect the children in the classroom I'll be monitoring if such a crime like this was to happen. (cont)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The lesson to be learned through Morgan Freeman, I guess to me as well, is that ALL words/actions can have consequences, and we need to better-acknowledge and be aware of all perspectives pertaining to what we are doing and saying, and be more present in the moment with someone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meanwhile... our current President of the United States of America, ladies and gents.  https://t.co/eSH9kcu3QL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>someone of the opposite sex uncomfortable. He has been sincere. He has handled it like a real man. I applaud him for that. Now leave Morgan Freeman the hell alone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I respect him even more for acknowledging what he may have done/said back when, realizing that he may have made mistakes with his approach to others, that he is now aware of how his former words &amp; affectionate actions could have resulted in making someone (cont)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HOWEVER, Morgan Freeman has acknowledged these complaints and immediately took responsibility for actions he wasn't aware of doing at the time, as soon as he could. He didn't just lawyer up and hide behind paid spokespeople and ignore it or deny, deny, deny. (cont)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is a huge difference between a predator and a friendly person. (cont)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>nd I do not believe this man wanted to hurt anyone intentionally. Personally, I don't believe that all affectionate men and women are evil and out to harm, and it frustrates me that so many innocent are being chased with torches because of harmless things like this. (cont)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I greet people I know with hand shakes or pats. I call people names like "sweetheart", "hon", "doll", "love"...I certainly don't mean anything by it, I'd never want to offend someone in saying such words, I have many friends &amp; family members who are just as kind and loving, (con)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know several men who do not intend to upset/hurt a female by greeting them with affection and have zero intentions on being some sort of predator in doing so. I'm a hugger myself, I'll hug anyone who talks to me or meets me or works with me... (cont)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most of the testimonials have said things like he's touched their shoulders or lower back while greeting them between takes filming, calls them names like, "sweetheart" without asking permission first, etc. His words were turned against him and/or exaggerated greatly.  (cont)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was no public release of a report during the time, or now, there is no evidence that there was a call to action made until now, 2 years later, by 4 women and 4 witnesses. (cont)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>as he pats them on the back, etc. The accusations/revelations gathered have not been validated and were not reported to police/public when self-claimed witnesses saw such-and-such and suggested they "put a stop to it". (con)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>also recanted the reporting of these claims and removed their first article.) *I* believed he wasn't purposely trying to hurt/upset anyone...he's just an affectionate man who was on set doing his job, acknowledging the staff &amp; crew, &amp; said things like, "Hello Beautiful" as (cont)<|endoftext|>
