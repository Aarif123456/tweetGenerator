<|startoftext|>@cupcake_meg Willing to share?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cupcake_meg You didn’t even have to use your AK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cupcake_meg @alysort Have you checked Innsmouth?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cupcake_meg I’m somewhat reminded of that pink wig from your amazon wish list.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cupcake_meg Looking forward to the pics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cupcake_meg @comradevenustas And capable of engaging in an adult conversation online where we clarify our positions and not engage in blindly attacking one another.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cupcake_meg @comradevenustas Something like that happened to me before. This type of communication lacks elements found in face-to-face communication and can lead to misunderstandings. Also, Twitter limits entry size so one can’t fully elaborate on ones ideas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cupcake_meg @comradevenustas Yes, there is more than just XX and XY sex. There is also sexes such as XXY.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cupcake_meg @comradevenustas I was touching upon more of the first portion of if biological sex topic of if it was real or not. I was arguing that yes, it is real. And yes, there is a gray area, but that doesn’t negate the “Yes” response to if biological sex question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@comradevenustas @cupcake_meg (3/3) This leads me to thing of gender. Biological sex is physical as seen with chromosomes while gender is social and is the social expectation of behavior based on chromosomal combinations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@comradevenustas @cupcake_meg (2/3) This is because chromosomal combination has to lead to something (if not, then why mention it?) and favoring two combinations implies a conclusion that is being rejected by the "No" response.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@comradevenustas @cupcake_meg (1/3) Reading this, I feel like "combinations of chromosomes" and "arbitrarily decided two of them were the most important" actually imply that the answer is actually "Yes."<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>(1 of 2) First time I traveled up here by myself. I typically come up here with family and friends.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I arrived safely at Huntington Lake just a little after midnight. Would have been here sooner if it wasn't for traffic and dinner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stopped at Grape Vine for a bit of a recharge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On my way up to the lake. Huntington, here I come.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pmalan1979 Thanks. I'm hoping that it'll be cool in the mountains.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And that's a wrap. Just finished helping @thealexhluch with his shoot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To that odd feeling when transition from sand to cement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Helping @thealexhluch with a shoot. With @yllwfever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pmalan1979 I doubt it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pmalan1979 Or what? You'll come down and make me?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just remembered. I actually won three 1st place ribbons. The third was for Risk Express.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pmalan1979 Yes, I remember that. Took me a moment to remember. And I actually thought you were referring to something else. My mistake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pmalan1979 I'm actually drawing a blank on that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mightymur Or how about ending up like Cain in RoboCop 2; a brain in a tank.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like that the crowd on Raw did the wave then started chanting "We are awesome."<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>FIGHT!!! #SuperBowlXLIX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Patriots interception. Game over. #SuperBowlXLIX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Patriots touchdown. Now Seahawks, let's see if you can do another touchdown. #SuperBowlXLIX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joemalley Everything is awesome for that 5 seconds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sack. #SuperBowlXLIX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go Seahawks! #SuperBowlXLIX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joemalley I know you love it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interception Seahawks! But also injury. #SuperBowlXLIX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice catch Seahawks. #SuperBowlXLIX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seahawks gambled and it paid off. #SuperBowlXLIX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice sidestep Patriots. #SuperBowlXLIX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Touchdown Seahawks! #SuperBowlXLIX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joemalley Good reason to start drinking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice throw and catch by the Seahawks. #SuperBowlXLIX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Common Seahawks. You're letting me down. #SuperBowlXLIX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joemalley Tell him he's not drunk enough. Once so, then he'd understand.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Quick question - who all will be going to @strategicon over Presidents' Day weekend?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just submitted an event request for the upcoming Strategicon that's happening over Presidents' Day weekend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, I'm glad that Cena didn't win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>John Cena will somehow be forced into the WrestleMania main event in the intervening months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The @WWE should have let Daniel Bryan last longer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was also expecting D-Von Dudley, Spike Dudley, and Rhyno to be in the #RoyalRumble as well. Nope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was expecting the Rock and Sting to be in the #RoyalRumble. Nope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Double German suplex by @BrockLesnar in the #TripleThreat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Besides Mother Theresa, who are some great humanitarians to have lived?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I learn about Rod Taylor's death as I'm watching "The Birds."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PasadenaFADS I haven't. And I don't see myself as much of a dancer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just heard a commercial for @Burke_Williams on the radio.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PasadenaFADS Nah. I'm more of a writer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PasadenaFADS I enjoyed it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Question - which groups are underrepresented in TV and movies?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's been several months since I rode my bike and it felt a little weird.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing 100% fool proof. Fools always find ways to live up to their name: that of being fools.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today, I wrote another entry for the Xerek Files and worked on distilling my notes for chapter 7 of my non-fiction piece, American Violence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok. Something's going down on Lincoln by Washington for 4 cop cars and a chopper overhead indicate that it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't decide if this heat is due to Climate Change or is just the typical LA strangeness in regards to weather.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I predict that Pride will win a number of awards. Because it's a British film, I predict that it'll win an Academy Award for best foreign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just saw the movie Pride and I recommend seeing it. I enjoyed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Question - when would you say the heyday of the traveling circus was in the United States?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just finished another entry in the Xerek Files today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just finished rewriting a short story of mine, adding 2,880 words to it, bringing it from 11 pages in length to that of 16.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You want to feel like a giant? Stand close to someone much shorter than you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Question - besides LA, NYC, and Chicago, what are some of the major US cities?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy birthday L.A.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just finished playing Mass Effect 2. Now it's time for Mass Effect 3.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got to thinking, with the necklace and bracelet I bought at @strategicon today, they have a bit of a gothic slant to them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got second place in Ticket to Ride Masters on Marklin with 157 points.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I played a number of Ticket to Ride games here at the con this weekend and as a result, I advanced to the Masters Final tonight at 7.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Didn't play to many games today at @strategicon. Mostly attended seminars. But it was still a good day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are all haunted by our past. And my ghosts are acting up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just arrived at @strategicon. Let the games BEGIN!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And with the chapter that I just completed, it's sixteen pages long, three to four times longer then the other chapter of the novel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've reached 67.1% completion with my third novel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kicking it at Islands with my brother and sister-in-law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who's going to @strategicon this coming weekend?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Question - of the TV shows House and The West Wing, which episodes or episode segments stand out to you in regards to being well written?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Question - how many senators should each state have in Congress?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Final travel time home - 10 hours and 20 minutes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I was only two hours off my prediction but I'm finally home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stopping at the Nipomo Starbucks as a rest stop, a bit of a refueling, and to journal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I predict that I'll be back in LA around 5.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's to an early start tomorrow so that I can beat traffic and get home relatively quickly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In 2 1/2 days, the furthest north I got was Santa Rosa, CA, taking the long route along the coast, for the most part.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Made it up to Bodega Bay today and went east to Santa Rosa in order to find a place to sleep.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@myhist Thanks. I'll check that out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pmalan1979 In Eric Cartman voice - "Damn hippies!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just saw two people cycling with no shoes on. My thought is that their feet must be in pain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Question - if you had the power to do so, what would you change in the United States Constitution?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@myhist Couldn't that idea also be expanded to the House as well?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pmalan1979 Not sure yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About damn time!!!! John Cena just lost at a PPV.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@myhist I was wondering, when the Constitution was being drafted, why was each state given two senators instead of just one? Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BadAstronomer I was wondering, what's the likelihood of Gliese 581 c possessing intelligent life? Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Question - if you ran a video arcade, what video games would you like to have available?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@myhist I was wondering, how important is the 10th Amendment and what would be the effect if it wasn't a part of the Constitution? Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you can, I recommend subscribing to the "My History Can Beat Up Your Politics" (@myhist) podcast.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Question - what does it mean to be anti-social?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With the formalities now done, we're just waiting for the wedding to begin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel like one of the best ways to deal with racism and discrimination is to first acknowledge it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had a long day yesterday. Was up for at least 20 hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did a little dancing tonight though I'm not much of a dancer, relying upon some capoeira moves to help me out.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Saw "Edge of Tomorrow" and I enjoyed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spent three hours this morning writing. Though I didn't add all that many words to the manuscript, it is gaining shape.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spent 4 3/4 hours writing at Starbucks. I was able to make a lot of progress. 35.4% completion on one manuscript and 62.1% on another.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just had my first professional shave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just saw "A Million Ways to Die in the West" and I enjoyed it. It's not Academy Award winning caliber, but still enjoyable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got some good writing done tonight. The second draft of my third novel is now 60.9% complete.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel like I'm in a position where I have to pay for other peoples decisions and mistakes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just say X-Men: Days of Future Past and I enjoyed it. Secret scene = Apocalypse.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The child in me is all excited for the win, but I'm playing it cool. That feels like the honorable thing to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just placed first in Monopoly Deal. Yeah!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With Monopoly Deal, the "Just Say No" card helped me to save one of my property sets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Round one of Monopoly Deal and I won. And I played my last hand quite well. That was what allowed me to win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With the maps that I've played so far, I need to work on the India map.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With these Ticket to Ride tournaments, I do great in the first round but then get rocked in the second.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got 3rd place again. I'm not going to advance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn. Got 3rd place in the 1st round with 98 points. 1st and 2nd place scored 139 and 137 respectively. Damn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Currently I'm the Ticket to Ride semifinals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got 3rd place for Risk Express.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For some reason, I keep thinking its Sunday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can tell how much of a zombie fan I am by the fact that I'm playing a game called Zombies!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I played Artemis, it took me a moment to realize that it was touchscreen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Played Star Trek Attack Wing earlier today and even though I lost, I was able to obtain Attack Fighters, the DS9 station, and a Borg Sphere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just received the Science badge for Artemis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ticket to Ride Qualifier, I placed 1st both rounds, guaranteeing a spot in the semi-finals. 131 points 1st round then 104 points 2nd round.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Won my first ribbon of the con.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I just submitted two stories of mine. One to PseudoPod and the other to EscapePod. Both of them belong to my Fifth Estate universe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are shaped by both what we do and do not experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USCArchaeology That looks like @ashley247 or an I mistaken?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USCArchaeology I remember that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We all want to be greater then what we actually are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OK guys.  My twitter account has hacked not that long ago, so if you got anything from me promoting anything, it wasn't me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ashley247 Nice.  Did you take advantage of this? :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Celebrating my brother's birthday with BBQ. Happy 32'nd Brian.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm wearing my XFL LA Xtreme jersey to @strategicon and I came across another XFL fan. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Second round of the tournament was India. I placed 3rd both rounds so its unlikely I'll advance to the finals. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok. First round of the Ticket To Ride semifinals is the Europe map.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes!!! I advance to the semi-finals of the Ticket To Ride tournament.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ticket To Ride Qualifier 1 second round, I placed second with 110 points. Got a feeling that I'm going to advance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ticket To Ride Qualifier 1 first round, I placed first with 115 points. Lets see how I do in the second round.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In four hours or so, I'll be off to @strategicon and hopefully a win in the regional Ticket to Ride tournament.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I believed in omens, that safety at the beginning of the Super Bowl had to have been one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seahawks win!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With the Super Bowl going on, the major news I have to report is that its raining in LA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Side step, side step, touchdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There should be a mercy stoppage for this game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There goes the Seahawks shutout. Oh well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FINALLY!!! Broncos score!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Broncos have no hope, no hope, in winning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shutout is in play.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Take that Broncos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Broncos didn't playing to well this half.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good thing the Broncos had that fumble overturned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interception for touchdown. Damn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I predict that Manny Ramirez will be kicking himself all night for that mistake. If the Broncos lose, he'll be kicking himself for awhile.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still waters run deep and are reluctant to surrender their secrets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FINALLY!!!! Cena loses!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I saw the Endeavour yesterday at the @casciencecenter and I recommend seeing it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Arbitrary milestone - this is my 1000's tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Playing Artemis and our computers are spazzing. Lame.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Haven't been to the MDR marketplace since its remodel. It's kind of cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At the Yard House in MDR with my parents for lunch. I'll let you know what I think.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joemalley What school?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joemalley I say go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy birthday LA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some times, we just need a hug to feel better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just speck 3 1/2 hours at Starbucks writing. Felt good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But I did learn a new game and I played Artemis, so thats good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>W/ this con, I won only 2 ribbons, &amp; they're both 3rd place. And w/ every Ticket to Ride game I played, I failed to place. Maybe next time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>W/ Ticket to Ride: Europe, 1st round, 104 points, 2nd place, didn't advance. But between then &amp; now, I bought a book &amp; learned a new game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About to play Ticket to Ride: Europe. Wish me luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IronClawEnt Correction: edition, not addition. Damn dyslexia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ticket To Tide standard addition, I got knocked out the first round. My final score 93 for 4th place. Winner had 153 points.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My Ticket to Ride: Team Asia team partner, after we played, said that I had a European sound to my voice. I found that a bit entertaining.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>W/ the team that won, defeated us, scored 194 points or something. That's insane. The only time I scored around that was w/ my iPhone app.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Final score: 147 and second place. Got knocked out in the first round.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm feeling conflicted. I both want to win Ticket to Ride: Team Asia and not to win. What the hell?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why am I feeling so nervous for this Ticket to Ride: Team Asia tournament?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Debating: Artemis or Ticket To Ride: Team Asia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Played Artemis earlier and I was Engineering. I prefer Science, but I feel like I did well in Engineering.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Played Risk Express a second time, and again, I got third place. To bad the game has been discontinued. I enjoy it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just got third place in Risk Express. Yes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About to play Risk Express. We'll see how I do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Playing a pickup game of Stones of Fate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today at Strategicon, a lot of Artemis and hopefully some other games.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1st time played King of Tokyo and I enjoyed it. With Lords of Waterdeep, scored 107 points and came in last place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1st day of Strategicon, played Star Trek mini, Lords of Waterdeep, and King of Tokyo.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Have you ever had one of those moments where you forget what day it was?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just saw "Pacific Rim" and I thought that I was ok. Not great. Think of it as a B-Monster movie from the '50's.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After several hours at Starbucks, I worked on the Xerek Files, my superpowers document, and started the second draft of my third novel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReshanS You can never have enough pirate insurance. Especially around Somalia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joemalley Na. Sounds like you're playing it right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joemalley Almost sounds like drinking will be involved...eventually.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First, I helped my brother move followed by getting my new entertainment center setup. 10, 10 1/2 hours later, I can rest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Three hours at Starbucks, and I finished an entry for the Xerek Files and started work on the second draft of a Fifth Estate story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joemalley Fuck that. I'll be taking all of it because there's no way you could stop me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USCArchaeology Something tells me that you might have wanted me around to help move things, like that table.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oliviawilde Maybe because you're more news worthy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe why mythical monsters act so monstrous is because people's first reaction to them is fear followed by violence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joemalley Hurray!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(2/2) Now I just need some beta readers to give me feedback on it to help catch anything that I might have missed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thealexhluch Just let me know when you'd like to pick them up. I might have one or two more that you may find useful, but I'm not sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After three hours of writing, I'm about 2/5's complete with chapter 35 of "Bridging the Stars."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(2/2) I'm just hoping that the editing process won't be to daunting regarding chapter 35.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(1/2) I can see the finish line of "Bridging the Stars." Now I just need to clear the hurdle of chapter 35 which is ten pages long.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thealexhluch When do you need them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thealexhluch Either one of these Hawaiian enough for you?  http://t.co/Y85M6gabX3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m on a roll. I just finished chapter 34 and I’m now 93% complete with "Bridging the Stars." Only two more chapters to go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thealexhluch Regarding spandex, try a scuba shop or @CTGibbon place. Regarding a Hawaiian shirt, I can check to see if I have something.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Trust is hard to earn, easily broken, and can be extremely difficult to fix.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just stepped out from Starbucks and smelled In-N-Out from a few blocks away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>72% of "Bridging the Stars" is now complete with only 58 pages left to go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At work, I see a soccer score posted of 8-0, and my thought is "damn, Uruguay *destroyed* their opponent."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Though it is a rough calculation, I suspect that it should take me just over a fortnight to finish editing "Bridging the Stars."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm now 70% complete with my second novel "Bridging the Stars."  Only 62 pages left to go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am not a crook. Now give me your wallet, your watch, and all of your political documents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It to see "The Crucible" in North Hollywood featuring my aunt Reba.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When presented with a situation where the ending is unknown, fear is a natural reaction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After 3 hours at Starbucks, I'm now 68% complete with my 2nd novel, read through a Xerek Files entry, &amp; worked on some supplemental text.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just saw "Man of Steel" and I enjoyed it. I also like that LexCorp was printed on the side of some tankers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DJMcNaughty As soon as they kill Superman, preferably with Doomsday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Honk if your horn is broken." - George Carlin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthPark What do you mean by "take down"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thinking about my previous tweet, I made an inadvertent reference to "The Shining."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have you ever felt that your life is all work and no play?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just finished chapter 21 of "Bridging the Stars." I'm now 66% complete with this manuscript.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thealexhluch That almost implies that LA has positive stereotypes. At least to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I might have to many ideas bouncing around in my head, preventing me from focusing on just one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Slow progress is better than no progress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ntarzi Sounds like you'll be going shopping.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joemalley Like playing pool?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chapter 20 of "Bridging the Stars" is now completed. 52.6% of the chapters and 63.3% of the pages are now complete.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even though we may travel with others on occasion, in the end, we travel our own path alone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizaPalmer And where can I find this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AriaIrene I wish the two of you the best of luck. Not on the obtaining the marriage license - the other thing. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm working on a Fifth Estate series bible. I'm debating if I should have bios for key characters and descriptions for groups. Any input?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArtHouseDirectr "Up" and "The Incredibles" immediately come to mind, but I'm not sure about their status on Hulu Plus or Streaming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ntarzi But since twitter only allows for 140 characters, short jokes are the only types of jokes available, at least through this medium.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AriaIrene I would like to go with salad bowl size.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With creativity, it can't work in isolation. Sometimes, just having someone to bounce ideas off of is all that's necessary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After 3 hours and change, chapter 19 of "Bridging the Stars" is now complete. 59% of the pages and 50% of the chapters are now completed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just removed 647 words worth of writing from "Bridging the Stars" during it's rewrite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have you ever freaked yourself out with a lucid or semi-lucid dream? Mine involved zombies. That should show you where my interests are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just saw "Epic" and I enjoyed it. The end credits were a little shaky though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the1johnnyd Also known as #science.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One thing I miss about having a ponytail is the ability to keep a pen in my hair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's Friday! The only problem is that it's Friday morning, so I have the entire workday in front of me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DJMcNaughty @mr_rhapsodist I like money #Idiocracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm considering starting an online collaborative writing project. Would there be anyone interested in joining?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joemalley Brain surgeon or "gay" friend?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chapter 18 of "Bridging the Stars" is now complete with 47.4% of the chapters and 55.7% of the pages completed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lost a sheet of paper w/ creative ideas on it to the wind. I can remember most of it, but fuck, I lost the rest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LukeLaurieGames Killing zombies. Good times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joemalley First thought, you're her "gay" friend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just supported @wombatgames &amp; @LukeLaurieGames game #StonesOfFate through Kickstarter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have you ever looked at yourself and wonder where a particular bruise or rash came from?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My take away from Strategicon this weekend. The only problem is that there should have been 6 ribbons instead of 5.  http://t.co/oGUnlt29WM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And with that, I'm bowing out of this con. Until next time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got second place in a pickup game of Tzolk'in while attending Strategicon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last day of Strategicon. Not to much going on today, but I'll still get a game in or two.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I placed fourth! Nnnooooooooooo!!!!! (agonizing cry). No ribbon for me. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ticket to Ride: Europe, round one, over. Victor: me. Final score: 123. Off to final round...and a late night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tonight might be a long night for me. Ticket to Ride: Europe starts at 10 &amp; is scheduled for 4 hours. If I advance, I'll be here all night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tied for second in Stones of Fate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Again, third place in Hearts. Almost achieved second.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(2/2) Good thing there wasn't anything that I was interested in playing in the hours to follow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(1/2) Well this is a bit of a downer. The schedule and signup sheet said 11am Hearts. But now I find out that it's at noon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joemalley Next one is from August 30 - September 2. Again at Sheraton Gateway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're truly interested, I could buy this for you with the intent of you paying me back. Its about $20.  http://t.co/8JecJRV34X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joemalley Sheraton Gateway. Right next to LAX. It's a gaming convention w/ boardgames, miniatures, rpg's, LARP's, and the like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This will make one hell of an ice cube.  http://t.co/wFXWfqpXlD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Day 3 of Strageticon. Here we go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the branch breaks under you to many times, it causes you to not want to go out on a limb.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only one ribbon today, but I'll take it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First time I didn't place in a Ticket to Ride tournament. Knocked out in the first round. 70 points; second to last place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You've got to rick losing in order to win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Final round of Ticket to Ride: 1910, I got third place with 134 points and achieved the Trans America Express bonus. Hats of to Manny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, my table (out of 4) was the first to finish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ticket to Ride: 1910 tournament, round 1, complete. Victor: me. Final score: 147. 6 tickets completed and Globetrotter achieved. I advance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About to play Zombicide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The spoils of my first day.  http://t.co/3hf4zePkI7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just played Jeopardy and lost. It was fun though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Earned my second ribbon. Second place in Stones of Fate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Earned my first ribbon. 3rd place in Hearts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm at Strategicon, and as I'm looking through their guide, I'm faced with a dilemma. Ticket to Ride or Zombicide? Though decision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who knows the difference between utopia, eutopia, and distopia?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A society can only learn and grow when it's flaws are pointed out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neiltyson Same here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(2/2) Now I just have to wait for 2:30 to come so that I can clock out and then head over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(1/2) Strategicon starts today. Weekend filled with boardgames, miniatures, and the like. Let's see how well I do in the tournaments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A section of road was closed as I was biking to work. When I saw two wrecked cars, I was like, "oh, that's why."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ToasterBoy I'm not lost. I know exactly where I am. It's just my relation to everything else that I need to figure out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReaIMilaKunis That may be because they don't want the worst they see in themselves to be experienced by others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ashley247 Are you a college athlete?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>As I think about it, there might be a biological imperative for writers/artists to create. But this just might be confirmation bias.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>To anyone in LA who wants to go west down Venice Blvd, I suspect that things will slow down as you approach Downtown Culver City.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Coming home, I herd a crash, saw smoke, and a cop car turn on its lights. Now I'm hearing more sirens and a police chopper. Something is up.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Some of my friends said that #NinjaWarrior/#Sasuke should be an #Olympic sport.  I'm inclined to agree with them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just saw "The Dark Knight Rise" and I enjoyed it. I recommend it. But I felt like it went on for a little to long though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>US politicians are upset about US Olympic uniforms being made in China. But that can be seen as un-capitalistic, and thus, un-American.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I either 1) just witnessed a car theft or 2) saw an owner incapable of disarming their car alarm before driving off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I saw "The Amazing Spider-Man" and I give it a passing grade.  It was ok, but it wasn't great.  It does have a secret scene in the credits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listen to @SkepticsGuide episode 363 for what's wrong with the movie "Prometheus."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1 thing I like about Ninja Warrior is that, despite the fact that a part of you knows that someone's going to fail, you still root for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I made some banana muffins and banana chocolate chip cookies this past weekend and I prefer the banana muffins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even though I'm a recluse, it does feel good to get out once in awhile.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The Culver City Expo Line Station will be opening on June 20th.  I'm looking forward to that. #GoMetro<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You want some excitement? A shooting occurred not that far from my place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm glad that I live near downtown Culver City now instead of Venice because it allowed me to get home quicker &amp; walk pass major congestion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One advantage of taking the bus is that I was able to get out of the vehicle I was in and just walk the rest of the way home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FYI - a stretch of Venice westbound is closed down from Robertson to about Bagley. Car accident. Traffic backed up in both directions.<|endoftext|>
